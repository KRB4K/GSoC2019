1. They claim to be for small government, but support a bloated military and agencies like Homeland Security that literally turn the Constitution into a piece of toilet paper.

2. While believing in small government, they tell folks that ideas like secession are treasonous.

3. Most American conservatives would identify as White Protestant, but salivate at the chance to import millions of Catholic mestizos, African and Asian god-knows-whats, and Moslem browns into the country.

4. Claim to be pro-capitalism and pro-free enterprise, but pass and support policies that allow monopolies to form and have no issue with said companies waging price wars to destroy small town businesses.

5. Claim to be religious and traditional, but have no issue with forcing homosexuality upon the rest of the world.

And this doesn't even touch on the Jew-worship aspect of many of these cucks..."

"The Chinese are so convinced that Israel contols America that it is not even debated in China anymore. It's just taken as fact. Here, read this excerpt from a speech given by professor Xu Xin who heads the political science department at China's largest university:Â 

âThatâs what the data shows us. It is undeniable from my perspective.â Professor Xu Xin told the IB Business Times when asked this question at a Jewish study group in late October. âThey run your media, universities and much of your government.âÂ 

The professor and his colleagues are so convinced that the Jews run the west, particularly, the US, that theyâve conducted a study to see âhow the Chinese can follow suit and match Jewish success running western institutions.âÂ 

âYes I think it is obvious that Jews control western world. They tell you who to wage war on, who to fight, who to support and how to spend your money. This is what we Chinese want to understand when we study Jewish dominance and hegemony of west.â Professor Xu Xin stated in the recent IB interview.Â 

The professor took things one anti-Semitic step farther stating,Â 

âThere are literally so many instances of how you have fallen for Jewish tricks. Hitler was the last person to openly contest Jewish rule and look how he is viewed. He is hated because of what Jews taught you with their films and books. We Chinese are amused at how gullible white men are. We want to find the same way to shape your thoughts. This is why we study them (Jews).â"

"Hunter Wallace of Occidental Dissent wrote a summary of an interesting NYT article exploring new discoveries on ancient human migrations:

 

It's interesting because it deconstructs the post-WWII narrative that ancient humans all happily mixed together. Instead the new research supports the older theory that the ancient human world was a violent one, with ethnic cleansing and genocide being a regular fact of life.Â 

While this does seem like a blow to the Jewish narrative, there is a caveat. David Reich, a Jewish geneticist who's been researching our ancient DNA, smugly proclaims that ""Europeans arenât quite who they thought they were"".Â 

The article asserts that the Kurgan Hypothesis is correct, that we native Europeans descend from ancient Aryan invaders who conquered Europe 5000 years ago.Â 

So the Aryan theory is correct after all, and yet Jews are accepting this. Why? I anticipate that they're going to use the revived Kurgan Hypothesis to deconstruct our people's claim to Europe. That we're ""invaders"" who stole the land, and that's why we deserve to lose our ancestral homeland.Â 

5000 years is a long time ago. Even if our ancestors slaughtered the earlier inhabitants, it doesn't negate our claim to the land. As the NYT article demonstrates, warfare was a regular fact of human life around the world. The Japanese conquered the Ainu and claimed the island for themselves, and no one questions the right of the Japanese to their homeland. Same for the Aborigines of Australia who replaced an earlier group of inhabitants. Even the pre-Indo-Europeans who our ancestors replaced were likely the ones who displaced the Neanderthals.Â 

We must reject any attempt at making us feel guilty over the ancient Aryan conquest. All of our people's accomplishments and our very existence is thanks to our ancient forebears having the foresight to leave the steppes of Russia, where we likely would have been overrun by Turks and Mongols far into the future.Â 

We must embrace and defend our ancient Indo-European heritage."

"Follow my train of logic

I know it's hard for you but just try

If Trump were inspiring the far right in Europe, and if the far right were growing because of him, then his popularity ratings would increase. Doesn't matter if the majority still hate him. Going from 5% to 15% approval is an increase.

The exact opposite has happened. He's not inspiring jack shit."
"You presented me a laundry list of bullshit

Keep in mind I said Trump was a failure because he failed to keep his promises. Did he campaign on taking care of rocket man? No. Deregulation? No. Any of your other useless shit? No.

Our #1 priority as white people is stopping immigration, which is our #1 threat. That's why Trump was elected. He failed. Next!"
"Trump was late to the game. Europe has had active far right movements for decades. We just got started on that in 2016 (if you can even call MAGA that), and it was too little, too late.

To everyone else, Trump sounds like a retard. The French are cheering ""we want Trump"" in the streets? WTF? Why is he begging Pelosi and Schumer for wall funding? Is he stupid?"
"I've seen conservative fake news sites showing pictures of the ""border wall"" -- virtually all of them are of a levee in texas, which is currently being funded by the 2018 omnibus. That's not a border wall of any sort."
"There's no wall. Trump signed an omnibus budget that funds the entire government for 2018. And he signed other budgets before that.Â 

Again, look at the first gab at the top of my profile. The entire budget allocates $0 for any wall. There is absolutely no wall, nor is there any currently under construction. You were deceived by fake news."
"You don't know very many Jews. Stop lying.

I grew up in diversity central, USA (in California we whites are now a minority), and Jews are by far the most hyper liberal, anti American, anti Christian em demographic I have ever encountered. And the majority of them support Israel."
"There is no wall of any kind, period. Look at the gab that I pinned at the top of my profile.

I am a proud Jew hater, and if you had any sense at all, you'd be one too."
"French are burning the bitch down and their government is scrambling to hold it together by offering concessionsÂ

iâm done with trump and his bullshit. he has no intention to build the wall. that heâs blaming the democrats like he didnât have two years to do it proves that he only ever planned to jerk voters around with the idea.

If it ever really existed as advertised it was dead the moment Trump gifted the military industrial complex $100m by vaporizing obsolescent sub-sonic cruise missiles in Syria to gauge his voters willingness to take on more ruinous debt by sending their sons into another war for the expansion of greater izrul. The cabinet picks were a red flag from day 1.

"1) since nearly all immigration to israel is through the law of return (are they allowing Chinese to immigrate there?), that's a de facto ban on Christians.

They're not free when they have to mooch off Uncle Sucker to survive."
Trump's Twitter account is getting more shrill as he sees his supporters turn against him. He probably won't get anything done but its proof that pressure is the only thing that works on Trump.
"The worst thing is that we take the fall for trump's stupidity.

There was a brief window when the alt right looked like evil overlords who won against all odds - remember the Time Magazine cover of Bannon as a machiavellian genius manipulating Trump. People researched us out of curiosity.

Now we're not only evil, but mentally retarded in the eyes of the public."
"Imagine the Trump supporters as a jar full of water and salt. The water is the people that are more discerning, people who have seen how flawed Trump is and are withdrawing their support. The salt are the low info people, people that believe that the Trump administration is an unqualified success, the wall is being built and the deep state is being secreltly defeated. The water in the jar is now very salty, and thus whenever you see a Trump supporter online they are almost always completely retarded.

"Prediction: Trump's support base is collapsing. Deluded boomers that think that Trump is actually building the wall and keeping promises are not enough.

"The #QANON cult is saying that the Trump administrations persecution of Julian Assange is actually a brilliant 4D chess move, and once brought to America and charged Assange can be pardoned by Trump (the cult members don't seem to realize that presidents can pardon someone before they've been charged or convicted).

Usually they will formulate their idea like this - ""Trump will pardon Assange. If you say he's not going to pardon Assange the you must think that the president is stupid or corrupt"". It never occurs to them that there is a possibility that Trump might be stupid, corrupt, or both.

The Qult has shown impressive levels of delusion so far but I wonder if the spectacle of Julian Assange being tortured, tried and convicted might be too much for even them.Â

"I must have heard thousands of times that ""antifa is a designated terrorist group"". I've not seen a scintilla of real evidence for that. Certainly there has been no public law enforcement announcement of such. And the cops don't treat antifa like terrorists. No terrorism charges, no RICO charges.

The alt-right and loosely connected groups like the Proud Boys ARE designated terrorists. Law enforcement publicly announced it in the case of the Proud Boys, and Congress passed a law designating the alt-right as terrorists in September 2017, which was duly signed by President Trump.

TL;DR - the antifa aren't ""terrorists"", we are."

"It's truly awe inspiring how much shit ""conservatives"" have managed to fuck up in such a short amount of time. As late as the 1970s, San Francisco was still electing Republicans and had a large working class Irish community.

Who helped turn it into Buttfuckistan and Gomorrah? Reagan the Messiah."
"Lastly, get out of here with this ""God"" nonsense. Reagan helped defeat a bill in California that banned homosexuals from teaching in public schools. As governor of California, he introduced no fault divorce and expanded abortion rights.

"QAnon is a fraud. What happened to the red wave during the midterms? Trust Jeff Sessions? Where are the trillions of sealed indictments?

Reagan wasn't coerced into signing amnesty, he did that all on his own, and bullshit like ""Hispanics are conservatives, they just don't know it yet"" came right out of his own mouth.

Get the fuck out of here with this nonsense."
"I'd forgive boomers ASAP for their bullshit if they collectively admitted ""yes, many of us fucked up then, but now it's our responsibility to do everything we can to turn our country around.""

Nope. It's always the same QAnon bullshit. 400,000 white Americans have died from opioid abuse and their response is snoring on the couch."
"Yep. The greatest enemy we have to face, have ever had to face, is our own people."

The fuck is wrong with these people?"
"It's just a variety of Fraktur, German font that is now considered ""racist""."
"When Reagan was governor of California, it was still a red state. This senile moron actually believed that ""Hispanics are natural conservatives"" and passed amnesty for millions of illegals. Remember the 1980s wasn't that long ago.

How did California become such a libtard state? It was all his fault. Texas is next. Congratulations ""conservatives""!"
"Yet in spite of all these odds I somehow made it in life. I don't look down on NEETs because I know how rigged the system is against them.

Don't brag about ""Trump's economy"", either, did you retards ever stop to think that Trump is getting his statistics directly from the BES (which gave Obama his numbers)? But wait I thought Obama's unemployment figures were fake."
"Why do you geriatric shits use ""unemployed"" as an insult? Services today are 400% more expensive compared to the 1970s. College tuition (even state schools), 1000%. Housing, 1000%. Who fucked these things up? Not my generation, but yours.

Your religion isn't that of the Hebrews, either. Pharaism (Talmudic Rabbinism) is an innovation that came in much later. Unlike the Hebrews, at first the Pharisees were a proselyting sect that welcomed converts. This is how you have your ""Jews"". Later they stopped converting people and the various Jewish groups became edogamous. I think you can accept the absurdity of ""Ashkenazi Hebrews"", ""Sephardic Hebrews"", and ""Mizrahi Hebrews"".

I've consistently found that white normies who are the most amenable to nationalist-populism are moderate liberals - they hate the GOP cuckservative agenda, they can be persuaded to accept immigration restrictions, and yet they hate SJWs and the near constant demonization of white men.

"Sarcasm noted.

But an invisible ""smart border"" would only work if there were a national consensus that immigration control is desirable. That doesn't exist. Any Democrat in office would try to undermine a smart border by any means possible (e.g. ignoring surveillance data, turning off cameras, etc.)

Can't do that with a massive concrete wall."
"Supporting Trump for President was taking a leap of faith. I don't think it was wrong to do so. However, support of president Trump after April of 2017 is inexcusable. By that time it was clear that Trump had been co-opted, and that we would not get a single thing from Trump.

So the original sin of the alt-right wasn't supporting Trump, it was failing to withdraw support for Trump. Had the alt-right withdrawn support for Trump, the alt-right would have been stronger than ever."
"Trump's modus operandi is to dog whistle as a white nationalist and populist while governing as a cuckservative.

This is truly the worst of both worlds. It means that voters will be driven to cynicism and unlikely to trust any actual nationalist populists in the future. Jeb Bush is bad enough, ""racist Jeb Bush who talks like a retard"" is a nuclear disaster."

The only good thing about recent events is that the âlets infiltrate the GOP and be secret racist republicansâ theory has been totally decimated. That was fucking idiotic. The GOP is trying to drum Steve King out of the party and he visits Holocaust museums and supports Israel.

"Years ago, I spent months trying a red pill a friend of mine on race. It actually worked. We lost contact with each other after he moved states looking for work.

"I'm glad to see some people are waking up now, but too little, too late. I saw Trump's betrayals before the first month of his presidency and abandoned ship early on.

The red flags were there even before his campaign - why did *anyone* on the alt right make 4-D chess excuses for Trump donating $100k to the Clinton Foundation? Trump University? A Jew son-in-law?"

"#7 is particularly insidious

Trump rants on twitter about his people being ""attacked"" by antifa and incites his dumb followers to fight back. Meanwhile, his own justice department is ignoring antifa and prosecuting their victims.

2. Tucker who is a VIP being harassed at his home by antifa with a âshit happensâ response from Trump.

3. Democrats expanding their midterm lead by a large margin long after the midterms are over (election stealing) while the GOP snores.

4. A promised executive order on birthright that was nothing more than a midterm political stunt.

5. Prison reform. BTW this is not a shock, the GOP congress and Trump himself made it clear that he wanted this to happen after the midterms. Some of these guys act like its the first time they heard about it.

6. Indictment of Assange.

7. Trump fedposting about people standing up &amp; confronting antifa while his justice dept. prosecutes them for it.

8. Caravan starting to cross with a typical laughable response that we saw the last time.

9. So-called conservative judges opposing and blocking Trump left and right. Trump responds like a deer in headlights.

It is becoming untenable to shill for this guy any longer. Thatâs fine but we should remember the people who were right about this. This is important because these sunny day friends threw a lot of people under the bus to shill for Trump. I have noticed they have transitioned suddenly with no humility about how wrong they were.

"Here is the hilarious thing about Trump's SCOTUS picks. We are told that even though Trump is a failed president, at least he picked good justices for the Supreme Court. OK. Lets test it.

Trump floated the idea of an Executive Order eliminating birthright citizenship. That EO would end up in the Supreme Court, where we supposedly have these good conservative justices, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Gorsuch has already proven unreliable because he refuses to remove criminal illegal aliens. So you know that he won't vote for Trump's EO. And Kavanaugh is a neoconservative. We can only extrapolate from the way other neocon's think about the issue, but its reasonable to guess that Kavanaugh would vote against Trump's EO.

Is it possible then that Trump didn't sign the EO because he knows that it would be shot down in the SCOTUS? I think that is very likely. So we didn't even get the good Supreme Court justices. We got nothing."

We know that even Cernovich is smart enough to figure out that Trump is an abject failure. The problem is, like Posobiec, he's a grifter who earns shekels by exploiting his idiot fan base. This is his way of deciding whether it's the right time to jump off the MAGA train."
"When the river reaches the ocean, the ocean does not lose salinity. It is always the river that turns salty.

"To me, this is by far the most disappointing aspect of Trump's presidency - it's revealed to me in no uncertain terms that the majority of American whites are mentally beyond rescue.

I thought Trump might at least succeed in radicalizing white conservatives. The exact opposite has happened; even alt righters are embracing cuckservatism.

What the fuck."
"I have some friends that are simply waiting things out. They think the same way that I do about what is happening in the broader movement, and are upset about the shilling for Trump, but they have taken a stance of non-action.Â

"I would have been happy with a civic nationalist president.

*Good faith effort to build the wall. Even if he didn't succeed.

*Maximum use of presidential authority to remove illegals.

*Modest attempt at reduction of legal immigration. Again, I would be fine if an effort was made in good faith but failed becuase of Congress.

*No wars for Israel.

Under Trump we haven't seen any of that. Trump doesn't even rise to the level of civic nationalist. I don't think I was demanding too much or being unreasonable."
"This is some chutzpah that you don't see from Whites. Mike Enoch saying at 1:30:30 seconds that he was warning about the false promise of Kanye West. This PoS was on Heel Turn.

No problem for Enoch though. His fans haveÂ microcephaly resulting in chronic amnesia.

"Serena Williams is by far one of the ugliest females I've ever seen in my life. Her white husband probably plays the submissive role in the bedroom.

"Ludwig Von Mises wrote about ""rightly understood interests"". That is because the way people percieve their own interests is often fallacious, and if their interests were rightly understood then they would make different decisions.

What could be clearer than the shilling for the Republican party on the alt-right that people don't know theirÂ rightly understood interests? Supporting the Republican party represents a time sink in which time is wasted, and an opportunity cost for which the price you are paying will never be known to you. Who knows - the opportunity cost of supporting the Republican party for the last 20 years may have been victory.

"Here's the problem. Some of these issues that you identified, like the attempt to undermine or overthrow the incoming Trump administration, are true. Others were just completely made up by Q and are bullsh*t. The true stuff is what was already known in the public sphere long before Q mentioned it. Q himself isn't 'military intelligence', doesn't have 'Q clearance', and is just a normal person laughing at the people that believe him. He didn't even come up with the QANON narrative. The person that came up with the narrative was Sundance from the Conservative Treehouse. The reason why Sundance's conspiracy theory never caught on is because he is a sperg with no inside info that frequently gets things wrong. #QANON caught on because Q made an appeal to authority by pretending to be an insider. Q lifted his narrative from Sundance in entirety.

The other problem with Q is that he inculcated the false belief that things are being resolved behind the scenes, and that certain actors like Sessions and Huber are doing things to clear out the deep state (they are not). Instead of Trump's base being mad as hell about it (and Trump was even trying to get people angry via his Twitter postings), Q actually put forth the opposite narrative, saying that the bad actors were actually good actors, and there is nothing to do but sit back and eat some popcorn.

This harmed Trump and harmed America. I knew that QANON was a hoax within 5 minutes of looking at how Q presented his 'info'. Real info is never presented in the form of riddles. And it doesn't have contingencies for getting things wrong like ""disinfo is necessary"". In the QANON frame Q cannot be wrong about anything. Either he is right or it is necessary disinfo. See how that works?

The Q believers are going to have to face squarely the reality that they were deceived and actually betrayed their own patriotic beliefs. If they don't they will fall for the next hoax around the corner."

Let's say you have a friend. He has a severe drug addiction and it's taking him down a dark path. You have the ability to influence him and set him back on the right path by giving him a stern talking to and constructive criticism. Instead of doing that you went and bought him a bag of heroin and then helped him shoot it up his arm, and started making weird excuses about how this is how friends should behave. With the worsening addiction and your enabling, the behavior of your friend became increasingly erratic.Â 

This is what the alt-right did to president Trump when he started going astray. Instead of offering constructive criticism, apologetics and outright shilling was offered. And when openly shilling was out of the question, fake narratives involving 4D chess and non-existant policies were used as an excuse for Trump's failure. The alt-right acted as enablers for the neoconservatives and cuckservatives in Trump's inner circle.

You're a retarded boomer. I'm not wasting any more of my time on this.

I've had this (nearly identical) conversation elsewhere. Exit polls are the only way we guage turnout by race.

"Nigger, I want to deport every single minority from this country (and at least 60% of white people, bare minimum).

Liberal SJW? LMFAO

Here's why I'm so hard on OM: he's violated his signature campaign promise, i.e. controlling our immigration disaster. Which he hasn't done - on top of being weak on illegals, he wants to massively expand *legal* immigration."
"That's a damn fence. Trump signed three bills that only authorize fencing, no wall, and mere *dozens* of miles of it. Since he's not using any money not allocated by a federal budget, there is no wall under construction.

The latest bill he signed allows local officials to suspend any border construction, wall or no wall.

What is wrong with you Trumptards?"
"I'll answer any questions you have as soon as Trump gets started on his wall by the end of his term.

Seriously. Let's make it a bet. $500 right to your PayPal if he does it. No commitment needed on your behalf. I'm a man who honors his word."
"Homosexuals are the most dysfunctional group of people in America, and yet never a word about how to fix themselvesÂ 

Hell, even blacks give lip service to violence in their communities every now and again when some litttle kid gets shot by a gangbanger.

Not gays. Never a word about their rampant promiscuity and drug abuse--only whining about suicide due to ""bullying,"" like it's an outside group creating all their problems.

Hey, I thought gay marriage and acceptance were going to fix all that. No? You still have anal warts, HIV and syphilis from your 500 lifetime sex partners? That's weird."
"He's a deadbeat nigger and he'll never pay up. We know this because he's defrauded nearly all his creditors in the past.

Now he's cheated White Americans collectively."
"Let me ask you a question.

Why is your God Emperor's new policy to spread homosexuality to the four corners of the globe? And why are ""conservatives"" cheering him on?

(That's a rhetorical question, we already know the answer: Because they're retards, that's why.)"
"You: ""Orange man good!""

Why do we call him bad? Because he is."
"They just tore down his prototypes in California.

There is never going to be a wall - Bathhouse Barry did more for border security than this orange idiot."

"Remember when there was so much hype around the âIG Reportâ and then it was finally released and almost nothing came of it, other than McCabe was fired? Then everyone was so hyped that a second IG report was supposed to come out, then like a year later and it hasnât even come out.Â 

Nothing is is ever going to happen to these deep state people. Theyâre untouchable."

"The mulatto also had a smarter foreign policy. Which isn't saying much, but there's a reason why Netanyahu gave a speech before Congress attacking him.

You remember all the cuckservatives cheering him on? Truly embarrassing stuff, I felt dirty having to defend a half breed closeted negro but this is what we've come to."
"Trump doubled down on:Â Global homosexuality,Â even more third world immigration, releasingÂ drug dealing thugs from prison.

Ann Coulter doubled down on: Border wall, mass deportation, end of birthright citizenship.

Ann coulter called out Trump and reminded him of his 2015/2016 platform.

Because of that âConservativesâ have dubbed her the latest âNever Trumperâ."

"The very worst thing about Qtards is that they are in love with their orange n*gger president because of virtual, unproven, &amp; hypothetical achievements.

Where are all the 10 trillion sealed indictments? Mueller is a secret agent for Trump? Trust Sessions? Blowout victory for the GOP in the midterms? Nowhere to be found. And yet they continue coping."
"You are trying to spin a flagrant betrayal of campaign promises as a positive and actually expect me to take you seriously. The whole point about spending bills is to prove that this administration has zero interest in securing the border. Were people chanting ""Repair the see-through fence"" at Trump's campaign rallies?

Get the fuck off my timeline."
"You live in a QTarded dreamland.

I've heard this ""just one out of many options"" fish tale before. It's bull crap.

What concrete barrier? Three spending bills. Zero ($0) allocated for any border wall. In fact the last one provides the courts legal justification to nullify any state of emergency to build the border wall."
"There are three spending bills that Trump has signed so far. Two of them explicitly forbid any federal spending on a border wall. The third allows any local officials to indefinitely suspend the construction of any barrier, wall or no wall.

You must be really popular among used car salesmen and MLM merchants."

"It transcends even biology.

You can look at Morocco - only has a homicide rate of 1-2 per 100,000 per year (within European figures), and most tourists report that it is relatively safe (if you're not a single woman).

All of a sudden when they move to France or the Netherlands they go beserk. It's because the cucked Europeans enable their behavior."
"You don't even need to travel abroad to see it.

Fifty years ago no Indian would dare telling a white woman to ""plz show bobs and vegene"" - now nearly every single female in my circle sees this shit in their facebook DMs. They used to fear white people, and rightfully so; they don't anymore.

Steve King is as good as it gets at the moment, I suppose. How do you make sure that the GOP doesn't jettison Steve King? You threaten to vote Democrat if the the GOP stabs Steve King in the back like they did to Roy Moore."
Steve King doesnât get shown on Fox News everyday âowning the libs.â Â Hence no memes.

Good job alt-cucks."
"Note to GOP supporting cucks on the alt-right -

If you had held Trump accountable for not keeping his promises then maybe your precious Republican party would have had a chance of winning. Many independent voters took a gamble on Trump and were betrayed. What did you expect would happen? You were warned constantly.

As far as I am concerned you have a chance to get your heads straight now and if you don't then you are an enemy. I have zero interest in allies that drop crude racial slurs while telling people to support conservativism. Conservatism + racism is a guaranteed loser. Total poison."

"Idiots say: ""Trump has Jews in his family, so he ought to be wise to the JQ.""

To illustrate how retarded this is, imagine if Ivanka were a coalburner married to Daquan Jackson. Trump not only welcomes Jackson, he makes him a special WH advisor to import ebola-infected Liberians and smuggle coltan from the Congo.

And my understanding is there was nothing in his posts on Gab that would have suggested that he would engage in 'direct action', as the antifacists would put it.

I'm not going to denounce him. He was unhinged by system gaslighting. When the White male is told that he is the worst thing on the planet by the media, the education system from birth, by the government that 'represents' him, and his mere existence is considered to be innately oppressive to other peoples, is it any wonder that some White males are going to go berserk and act out?

The system made Robert Bowers who he is. A victim of society and nothing else. Instead of dealing with the symptom, meaning his violent outburst, the underlying factors that led to it must be obviated. Anti-white policies and agendas must be abolished immediately.

"Look lady

Three times now, you cited articles that I debunked, and you stubbornly persist in your delusions.

"Unless you think there is magical spending for a border wall that comes outside the federal budget, there is no border wall under construction.

I know that your God Emperor signed an omnibus bill in 2017 forbidding any federal funds for a border wall.Â

Trump pulling out of the Iran deal is problematic for him going forward as well. He did this right in the middle of negotiations with North Korea.

2. Signed a bill condemning us as terrorists. The bill called on law enforcement to take measures against us and only us, and that is what has happened.

Your friends over at TRS radio said it was symbolic. They got it wrong. Instead of holding Trump accountable to the extent that we are able, they doubled down on Trump support and became his sycophants, destroying all the momentum that the movement had immediately after the election.

"Let's get real about the allegations contained in divorce filings by Richard Spencer's wife. You can go and read about it yourself if you want to see the particular details. It's all over the news today.Â 

These kinds of allegations in divorce filings are now so common place that you expect such allegations. A close friend of mine faced exactly the same allegations from his ex-wife and I know for a fact that he never laid a hand on her - in fact it was the other way around, sadly. Everyone has heard stories like this.Â 

In this particular situation both Richard Spencer and his wife sought to have the filings sealed. If his wife was out to get Spencer she would be happy to have the filings publicly disseminated, but she sought to have the filings sealed. That means she was trying to get advantage within the divorce proceedings itself, and not trying to bring harm to Spencer's reputation or standing within the community. Despite this the judge denied the request to seal the filings, saying it is in the public interest to have the filings available to the public. What possible public interest there could be, I don't know.Â 

Ultimately I don't care if the allegations are true or not and a man is entitled to have personal space as it relates to his wife. If you are tempted to pile on Richard Spencer at this time, rememberÂ John 8:7."

"In the long run, ""triggering the libs"" backfires terribly. Nigger radicalism worked for them. Second wave feminism worked for them. 

Unlike whites, the pet constituent groups of the DNC actually feel like they are under siege, and that's when they work overtime to ram their agenda through."

And then he shot 'em all.

I don't care if they were niggers. Not one sane white person looked at that and said ""whoa, I'm racially aware now!"". If he had shot up nigger thugs that would be a different, but he was a bitch raised by a single mother (like many of you WNs)"
"You were raised by a single mom.

Now I understand your psychology."
"You are making shit up. Immigration has increased in Norway since 2011, although they're still not quite as bad as Sweden.

A Jewish shill

Mentally deranged

Murdered white children. Not one of us.

Again, where was your father when you were growing up?"
"I read it most of it. He's fucking mental.

And his actions have made Norway even more recalcitrant against the far right. We don't ""murder their kids before they can kill ours"", that is some Jewish shit straight out of the Talmud. It's the Israeli rationale for murdering Palestinian kids who have rocks in their hands.

And he was a Zionist. That settles it!"
Did you have a father in the home?
"When I see shit like white kids marching in gay pride parades or wearing pink pussy hats, I feel pity. I don't want to murder them because I'm not a Jew brainwashed psycho. That's the ethos of Semitic peoples, not us.

I know plenty of people who grew up in similar environments and escaped.

BTW what was Breivik's legacy in Norway? They're less libtarded now right?"
"Wow 3 exceptions to the rule.

Look! So many mud people in these photos.

Let me ask you something - Were you a national socialist since you were a kid? I bet not. I'll even wager that your own parents don't know that you LARP as a Nazi online, and would disown you ASAP (no more tendies) if they found out.

Breivik was a cuck for the Jews. The end."
"His manifesto was a serious problem. The idea of adopting Breivik as a mascot is wrong headed because he didn't even do it for our cause. 

Breivik is 100% on the counter jihadists. Which means it is 100% on the counter jihad sponsor. "
"But it's literally true. He was a zionist.

It's why he targeted white children first rather than shooting at migrant invaders or blowing up a synagogue."
"He was a Jew worshiper and a Zionist. Not one of us.

I don't care what else he did or wrote, he was a puppet just like the rest of them."
"I unironically agree with crazy vegan chick on Breivik.

He lost me when he shot up those children in UtÃ¸ya. The majority of us have had libtarded opinions at one point or another when we are younger. That doesn't mean we were worthy of death.

Also we know from Breivik's manifesto that he was a hard core Zionist. Everything about his life is suspicious."
"Leaf lard is another superior product. The very best for making pastry dough.

Yet another Aryan food that has been demonized by kikes in the nutrition industry."
"Trump is the 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!' president. Looks like a nationalist, talks like a nationalist, but isn't a nationalist."
"Trump is the Republican party. Look who he put in his cabinet - Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs, neocon, neocon, Goldman Sachs.

Oh, and he's campaigning right now for the very Republicans who viciously insulted him only months ago."
"""Why should I listen to people who lie compulsively defending a neocon who shills for Goldman Sachs?""

Exactly, why should they take the alt right seriously?

You'll find that a non-trivial % of liberal white Americans are favorably disposed to Trump's policies on trade and immigration. They hate the radical left. We can't recruit them anymore."
"This isn't a victory. 

Before today, most normies didn't understand what nationalism is and that made it easier for us frame nationalism as biological in nature. 

Now thanks to the God-Emperor, most normies will associate nationalism with jingoistic patriotardism, tax cuts, and Zionism. 

Trump has made our jobs 10x harder. "
"Vdare's function consists mostly of clickbait, and hosting dissident conservatives like John Derbyshire and Pat Buchanan who have been marginalized for their views.

They are the worst shills.

""Look at what the crazy libs have done now! Vote GOP to stop white genocide! Also you can't view our archives unless you donate to us!"""
Yet another conservative NPC. I called it.
"Typical conservative idiot doesn't understand that environmental regulations helped us control acid rain and ozone depletion.

We actually measured it. The problems didn't resolve on their own."
"I used to laugh at chinks who slavishly worshipped Mao Zedong, a monster who massacred millions and desecrated their culture.

I don't anymore, because I notice the very same patterns of mass delusion in white conservative America.

At least the chinese have an excuse as their entire media is controlled and the majority were illiterate until recently."
"5D chess fantasies are always bad but Wictor is on a completely different level

He makes up the most insane bullshit and his legion of idiot followers swallow it like gatorade. They're not even convincing stories at all. They're wackier than scientology or the book of mormon.

Every single day I despair at the stupidity of white America."
"Perhaps I'm being too cynical, but Trump's tweet about how the Democrats need to change the laws seems a prelude to Trump allowing the caravan in and then blaming Democrats and their ""laws.""

To hear these people talk, you'd think we don't already have a GOP president, house, senate, and supreme court. You'd think we don't have solid laws already on the books."
"Here Wictor is attempting to whet his shabbos goy amen chorus' taste for additional jewish wars. ""Don't you love bombing muslims goy?""

No one believes the Afghan War is ""winnable"". What does winning in Afghanistan even mean? We were told that these nations we bombed and invaded were craving Western democracy. That was a lie. These people want us to GTFO, and 17 years, thousands of wasted US lives, and trillions of wasted dollars later that's exactly what we should do.

Who wants us to stay? The MIL, andÂ  the Jews - who want their crumbling North American colony to destroy Iran before we collapse into a favela-flavored bankrupt 3rd world hell. If an Iran war led to a nuclear exchange with their far too White, former Russian colony that would be even better.

Wictor - an Iranian invasion would absolutely require a draft. How many of your relatives would you send?"
"Thomas Wictor is mentally cracked

""Like all of Trump's critics, Joscelyn refuses to accept that trump is a student of Sun Tzu.""

Yeah I'm sure Trump is well versed in ancient chinese military philosophy

LMFAO

"""Vote for the Republican party in the midterms or the Democrats will be killing us in the streets!""

- alt-right Republican NPC"
"Lets face it. The only argument the ""white pillers"" have is that the Democrats are worse than the GOP but that is a very old claim that has been around for decades. It takes zero brain power to make. It is the thing holding up this red team blue team farce. You vote every four years for tax cuts because the alternative is the Democrats. Wow how exciting."
Here's how politics works in the real world. Have a town hall meeting with your congressman. He takes questions or whatever. Then a representative from Tyson Foods shows up and it's game over. How do locals compete with him? They don't and it doesn't matter how many times they call. You would need leaders who won't cave to big business. We don't have them yet.
"The very first ""caravan"" was when that traitor Reagan amnestied only a ""few million"" illegals. Soon that skyrocketed to tens of millions through chain migration.

The goblins keep invading because they know El Gringo does nothing to stop them. Over half of all border patrol officers are Hispanic. ICE can only handle thousands of cases at a time. It's a sham."
"Momentum has completely changed in the Senate. I'm saying it.

Spics are too lazy to vote. Same with millennials."
"I thought for a while that a blowout GOP loss in the midterms would wake the alt right out of its complacency. It would shatter Trump's image as infallible God Emperor and bring them to their senses.

Then I realized... nope, charlatans like Kike (((Enoch))) would turn their angry fans against us for ""sabotaging the election"". They are irrational morons."
"It's the ultimate face saving excuse. ""Muh Demokwats!""

You saw the same maneuver with Obamacare - how often did the GOP campaign on repealing it? And when the time came to repeal it, oops, it turns out they never actually had a plan. It was all a lie because things like no preexisting conditions and expanded Medicaid were popular in swing states."
"(((Mike Enoch))) on TRS even personally took credit for ""stopping the caravan"". Which is shameless dishonesty as the last one completely entered our borders.

I have angry idiots in my mentions rights now insisting that Trump stopped the past few caravans and that I'm a black pilling shill. And people wonder why I savage the alt right."
"Also (((weev))) was one of the few on the dissident right making 4D chess rationalizations. Eventually his opinion became doctrine on the alt right. We're the shills for being consistent on this issue.

It's funny how morons fall for the same Jewish tricks over and over again."
"Does anybody remember that (early 2017) episode of TDS when Mike Enoch erupted in rage over Trump bombing that Syrian airbase? He swore never to support him ever again. Even Cernovich quit MAGA.

Why have all these cucks gone on their word like dogs returning to their vomit? Trump hasn't changed."
"Any identity group can have griveances with the system, but only the white male is consistently dissed by the system.

It's a testament to the perfidy of the enemy that it isn't enough that they try to minoritize us in our homelands, they also seek to rub salt in our wounds by insult and gaslighting.

What is interesting is that they have held up a mirror and psychologically projected their own vile thoughts onto us, casting us in the role of the nemesis of the rest of mankind.

This will be corrected."
Comments on FOX News covering the Khashoggi story
"The only way to wake up these delusional Trump zombies is with a blowout loss in the midterms.

Democrats are retards. All they had to do was NOTHING and coast their way to victory."
"Holy Shit!

I love this post. Â I donât know who this guy is but he incapsulates the perfect boomer conservative. Â Angry, petty, pathetic and mad at the world for making him learn new things and not the world catering to him. Â  Golden."
"Some graphs to illustrate how much more food we are growing per acre over time. Remember - most of this trend was underway before GMOs, through breeding and hybridization of already existing crops.

White ingenuity has saved billions of non-white lives over the past several decades. I don't want to hear any more whining from them."
"This is obviously bad from a health perspective, as we've sacrificed quality for quantity (e.g. tomatoes taste especially bad, American butter tastes like margarine compared to Kerrygold imported from Ireland). I can't imagine the new produce is healthy, either - look at the vast majority of Americans.

It's still too expensive."
"Yields for every crop and animal have skyrocketed over the past century.

For example, the average dairy cow in 2018 produces *four times* more milk per day than in 1900. Not only that, these big ag fucks are all exploiting cheap labor. Plus we have ""free trade"".

There is no legitimate reason for anything to be this expensive. It's all a scam."
If your '4d chess hot take' sounds like something Bill Mitchell or Mike Thernovitch might post - you might just be a dumbass cuck.
"Correct

After Trump's incompetence and betrayals. After he has demonstrated both ignorance and apathy with regard to our immigration crisis. After he lies repeatedly on twitter (""I'll ban transgenders from the military"", etc.)... What's the response from the alt right?

Attack everyone who criticizes Trump for being traitors. We are in deep shit."
"Trump ran as a nationalist populist, not as a conservative. We are more than an economy - Bush had a strong economy for years and look at his legacy.

If you want to suck Trump's dick, point out what he's done that Bush or Rubio wouldn't have done. SC justices &amp; tax cuts don't cut it. Where is the damn wall?

Also, the fuck does Korea have to do with our people?"
What good job? Go list some of his accomplishments.
"So far it looks like the mainstream Right is throwing the Proud Boys under the bus. I was wondering if that would happen to based 56%ers and racemixers.Â

"-America bombs Libya to stop terrorism. 

-Libya eventually dismantles its WMD program, and offers friendship to the US.

"People literally thought they put Trump in office by worshipping a frog named Kek and posting cartoons online.

In the end, they turned out to be easily brainwashed by Jewish tricks, just like the rest of them. Nobody should be surprised."
"If the Amnats really wanted to pursue a true American Nationalist strategy then it behooves them to jettison the ""American Nationalists"" with serious baggage in their pasts. Who?

Andrew Anglin - says he runs a ""white supremacist"" website. Claimed to organize an ""armed march"" in Montana.

Weev - former felon. Threatened to kill Jewish children in faxes to US universities. Has a huge Hollywood swastika tattooed on his chest.

Mike Enoch - serial Roman saluter. Ruined Richard Spencer's NPI conference. Anti-semitic podcaster from ""the Daily Shoah"". Claims to be competent at law without a law degree or passing the bar.

Jesse Dunstan - Sells ""shoah oven mitts"". Anti-semitic podcaster. Says the N-word like he has tourettes syndrome.

None of these dorks are acceptable representatives of American Nationalism. Which is why what they are doing isn't about American Nationalism. As Richard Spencer says, its a shibboleth. They are up to no good."
"Why would a Jew like Weev support a candidate that wants to fight Jewish power in a rational manner? What he wants is people that threaten to kill Jewish children to anathematize our movement.

Me: ""OK. So we are naming Jews other than Weev then?"""
"It's funny because the co-option of the Tea Party is a very recent event within the memory of every person in the alt-right. No one can say that they didn't have a heads up or see the warning signs.Â 

The Tea Party got flooded with Movement Conservatism money, so at least what happened can be explained partially by that. But what explains the immediate surrender of the alt-right? As far as I know none of these guys saying ""vote GOP"" were paid off, although it would make a lot more sense if they had been!

The TRS guys had a vague, very vague, plan to take over the GOP. When I questioned Mike Enoch on the TRS forums he told me that you get influence by supporting the Republican party. Didn't make sense about over a year ago and it doesn't make sense now. I got banned from the forum because I made him look bad, which is very bad form."
"America's bizarre, schizophrenic ME policy only makes sense when you understand that it only serves the interests of Israel. Examples:

- Toppling Saddam Hussein bc he supposedly sheltered the very same Al Qaeda.

Etc."
"I don't give a rat's ass about the death of sand nigger Khashoggi. He was a typical duplicitous Arab who preached modernity &amp; tolerance in English whileÂ  touting Islamism in Arabic.

They won't even say the word 'terrorism' anymore. 9/11 is just some sort of mysterious natural disaster that triggers teh sadz. Dubya is still their president, but what was so great about him? Blank-out.

C. Doubling down. This seems to be common among deplorables now. It's extreme before the midterms. It'll be ext-REAM in 2020. We'll hear of new dimensions of chess never known to man."
"I always expected Trump to cuck to Israel - grant a few concessions here and there (e.g. Jerusalem capital) in return for a saner foreign policy. He wasÂ  an outspoken critic of the Iraq War and I thought it made him credible.

Even the liberals won't get to see their all expensive welfare state. Left wing populism doesn't work in Latin America because mestizos and other mud people can't build an advanced economy. They're poor under socialism and poor under capitalism."
They also benefited from the Democrat realignment about civil rights in the 60's. Without that realignment they would have never taken congress in 1994 and so on. They hate to admit it and never will but the 21st century version of the GOP was all built on White racial anxieties.

I have called for an intolerant minority strategy (see Taleb) that is time proven to work. We torpedo the worst of the Republican candidates to force the GOP to stop fielding these candidates. Remember that their main excuse is 'electability' for their support of open borders fanatics, neocons, and cucks. If we make them 'unelectable' then it becomes infinitely harder for the GOP to deploy these enemies against us.

I am not calling for a race war; I am demanding that we use proper strategy in electoral politics. Cantwell stramanned this on his show, alluding to me and saying that I am calling for an immediate race war.

Cantwell said vote for anyone with an R next to their name. When I asked him if he would support John McCain and Paul Ryan, he emphasized that he would, saying that he would even vote for the corruptÂ Republican DA that tried to railroad him into prison. Obviously, I denounce this line of thinking.

I want to WIN. And voting for the GOP unconditionally is the biggest LOSING strategy there is. And although I am interacting with people on this matter, this is a fact that isn't even up for debate."
Man I wish Republicans were even half as racist and fascist as liberals accuse them to be.
"From September of last year - less than 25% Republicans in congress are willing to fund a border wall. 25 fucking percent.

In before ""pollz r fake news"" - this poll aligns very closely with actual voting records in the House &amp; Senate.

Of course, predictably, every single one of these traitors is campaigning on ""immigration"".

Trust the plan deplorables! MAGA!"
"Why don't we just compromise and agree that all white Americans are cucks to some degree. South Carolina has re-elected Lindsay Graham how many times? Etc.

Well, OK here in California our cucks are especially loathsome, but other than that, we're all homeless in the outhouse together"
"Light green: (approximate) distribution of Celtic languages in 275 B.C. 

That dot in (what is now) Turkey would be Galatia (as in the Bible, Paul's epistle to the Galatians).

In 2018, only one nation (Ireland) has a Celtic language as an official language, and hardly anyone speaks it."
"I don't even blame the media per se

It's the American people who are the problem. They demand this ridiculous, brain numbing rot.

Check out the comments on Breitbart's FB page. On occasion they report things like Trump endorsing DACA, lack of progress on the wall, etc. and the butthurt in the comments is surreal. ""You're fake news JUST like CNN!""

Good grief"
"Kinda. He grudgingly supported Trump near the end of October. After months of mocking Trump with his cringe-worthy skits (in drag) and insulting Trump supporters on twitter.

Nowadays I don't give a fuck if anyone mocks Trump, since he is eminently mockable. That's not the problem. It's that this cuck hated Trump's populist message.

I hate conservatives."
"And that's not even their dumbest conspiracy theory

Their piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance is Trump leading a crusade against a secret cabal of pedophiles controlled by Hillary, Obama, and the FBI.

Yes, because if Trump is known for anything, it's sexual chastity and concern for children. The guy denied medical care to his sick nephew over an inheritance dispute."
"Here's a skit that drag-loving cuck Steven Crowder did in April of 2016. In it Trump is a socialist loon who wants to ""raise your taxes"". It's one of the most cringeworthy things I've ever seen.

Flash forward to today - Crowder is ecstatic that Trump is president. What exactly has changed between then and now?

"
His twitter account was amazing when he was calling out the GOP. Now all he does is claim every Republican candidate is tough on borders (lol) and how about them dang Demoncraps? It is all bullshit. Policy is all that matters and we get none of that. All the policy has gone to the investor class and Israel.
seen on /pol/:
"That was the number one talking point the yuppie suburban GOP voters made vs. Trump - that he was a socialist. Now of course they are the biggest cheerleaders for him, They still don't like his twitter account tho - that is too lowbrow for them. But in the end they get the policy and we get the tweets."
"His twitter is worse than useless now,Â  because we correctly see it as the delusional rants of a senile old git. It was perfectly fine when he was discrediting the media. Now, on top of being a betrayer of promises, he sounds like a whiny and petulant 6 year old.

How about he use his twitter to unseat some RINOs in the primaries? No? Too little too late."
The number one way to do this is through economics. That is how we secure the White left. Unfortunately the GOP would rather eat poison than give up their neo-liberal economics. 2016 showed the way. The way to victory is through states like Michigan and Penn but the GOP threw that all away because they had donors to pay back - I don't feel sorry for them.
"Yup

And remember that normie conservatives hated Trump up until he was elected. Matt Walsh openly said he hated Trump supporters. Steven Crowder made skits mocking Trump and calling him a socialist (cringe).

Trump has betrayed the very same people responsible for his election. He never liked them, has always looked down on them, and takes them for suckers."
B-b-but /pol/ told me he was based and made bunch of memes about him.
"""Put to pasture"" + ""death"" = ""put to death"". That is plausible. A simple mistake.

Do we know exactly why that was said? No. But it was plausible.

What is not plausible is a retarded QAnon conspiracy about a RINO conspiring to kill another (well respected) RINO for, umm, reasons. And admitting it on live TV, which destroys the point of a conspiracy."
"Politicians misspeak all the time

Yes I'm sure Kasich, a RINO and Trump hater,Â conspired to put McCain to death and knew about it advance. When McCain was a RINO and loved by other RINOs.

?????

You are dumber than a black African."
"America will collapse and then we'll have to pick up the pieces.

I don't see that happening either (look at South Africa, Brazil) but there are no longer any political solutions for the survival of white people in America. Not when the majority of whites themselves are delusional, including most of the alt right."
"Boomers were not old enough to vote for the '65 immigration act, desegregation, or anything else. In California, at least, they turned out to vote for Prop 187.

The problem is as soon as they came of age, they did nothing to correct the mistakes of their elders and even made things worse. I can't think of a single boomer politician who isn't a sack of shit."
"McCain wasn't executed, moron. He died a natural death.

QAnon is also a hoax. Where are all the thousands of arrested pedophiles?

Oh, and your God Emperor endorsed him, remember? After all the months Kelli Ward supported him, Trump shivved her in the back not once, but twice."
"Another low IQ comment.

Shill

Either address my points or shut up."
"Trump is an old man who is already wealthy beyond our wildest dreams. Like Jesus said in the parable of the rich man, ""you fool, soon you will be dead, and what use will your filthy lucre be in Hell?""

Not only did he waste months on that tax scam, at a campaign rally, he lied and said ""people like me would be paying so much more in taxes"".

A con artist extraordinaire."
"Trump wasted months of his political capital on a tax bill - not on immigration, not on trade, but tax cuts. Something that doesn't even impact his working class base as they don't earn enough.

This is a particularly insidious betrayal because the tax cut benefits his own family to the tune of millions. Why does a senile old man care this much about his shekels?"
"Yeah youâre right. We criticize every single aspect of Society, including ourselves. Out of all the things we criticize, boomers stand head and shoulders above the rest as the most thin skinned, crybaby mother fuckers there is. Thereâs some good boomers, but on average, man, theyâre one hell of a self entitled whiny group."
"The dumbest cope of all time. You can only blame the courts when they block legislation. Where is it?

Who drafted an omnibus bill that forbids fed funding for a border wall? That's right, the GOP. Who is deeply committed to (((free trade)))? Again, GOP.

Trump should have primaried the losers long ago but he didn't - he campaigned for cuckservatives. So based."
"1) we already have a GOP majority in the Senate and no nuclear option. These morons are doing fuck all. And the current crop of candidates are cuckservatives.

2) Trump isn't being ""betrayed"" by his party - he *is* the GOP. What kind of a cuckold hires the former (((prez))) of Goldman Sachs to draft his econ policy? An open borders guy who voted for Hillary?"
"""Triggering the libtards"" is a worse than useless, as liberals are at their most successful when they are angry and feel a common purpose. Look at feminism and LGBTQ activism. Are they winning or losing?

A strategy that actually works is turning the moderate left against the radical left - this won't happen because the modern GOP is awful across the board."
"It's because of narcissism. A classic boomer trait.

Most millennials who post here can admit that we are a very flawed generation. The soyboy and NPC memes came from us. Boomers can't even take a joke.

A simple ""yes, we apologize, and we'll do everything we can to reverse the decline"" would suffice. Nope. They keep voting for retards and we pay the price."
"Because the alt right is full of grifters and e celebs who misinform their fans for shekels.

American cultcha is also largely to blame - one of our worst habits is guileless optimism, almost to the point of mass delusion. ""I don't want to hear things that make me uncomfortable! Stop insulting our guy!"" Etc. They'd stop listening to TRS if they told the truth."
"Occam's razor

Few people know what it is. Even fewer know how to use it.

The reason why they need 4-D chess narratives is because they know that Trump has hardly achieved anything in office, and never will because he is incompetent and mentally unstable. He hired Gary Cohn and bragged about it at a campaign rally. This is their based POTUS who loves his people."
"Voting only matters when there's somebody worth voting for. Other than a few exceptions like Steve King, where are these based politicians? They're all useless shits.

I don't even have excessively high standards - basic civ. nationalism is fine, don't cuck on immigration, fund the damn wall, etc. The GOP fails basic standards of acceptability. Fuck them."
"For years, anybody who sent money to TRS was subsidizing the lifestyle of a cosmopolitan Jewish couple in Manhattan. Mike Enoch's wife was presumably in on this scam, as she read a poem during a Christmas episode.

Actually, never mind the past tense - they're still handing over their shekels now. WTF

And people wonder why I call the alt right stupid."
"Hello fellow alt-right and pro-white people.Â 

I have a brilliant plan to save the white race at this crucial time, at this, the tipping point.Â 

The plan is to vote for the Republican party unconditionally, to keep the Democrats out of power because the Democrats will be openly killing us on the streets like they did under Obama.Â 

Having the Republicans in power will give us time to win, because the lower the percentage of the white population is, the higher our chances of winning. And besides the GOP is the party of white people, and if you don't vote white then you are anti-white.

This is a public service announcement from theÂ Republican Jewish Coalition."

"I have a friend who considers himself a right-wing Christian. He is livid that I refuse to vote in the midterms (and has even threatened to end our friendship). His problem is that he listens to alt media filling his head with 4-D chess narratives.Â 

This is why I have nothing but harsh invective for the American alt-right. You assholes are leading us off a cliff."
"Probably something like that. Sub-Saharans in Africa don't come close to their genetic potential for height, athletic ability, or IQ because they cannot furnish the necessary environment for themselves.

"Basketball Americans are roughly 4:1 negro:white. No way is the negro fraction that high in Puerto Rico.

What's funny is the IQ tests seem to underestimate PR's incompetence - they score lower on academic assessment tests than American blacks. Something else must be going on here."
"* ""Afghanis"" are not an ethnicity, as Afghanistan is a composition of diverse ethnicities (Hazara, Pakhtun, Tajik etc.), so this IQ average must be taken with a grain of salt.

That being said, I see little evidence that any of them are much better than all the others. Morons are morons."
"If Richard Lynn's research is to be believed, Afghans* and Puerto Ricans are even dumber on average than African negroes (average IQ = 85). The feds have already allocated $44 billion in aid for PR (by comparison, PR's entire GDP is barely $100 billion).

We are literally throwing our hard earned money at retards."
"I wouldn't even be that charitable. He's a narcissist and a grifter who says whatever he thinks will make him popular at the moment.

The only reason why Trump tweeted anything about white South Africans is because he saw something about it on FOX News. That's it. Remember this guy believed health insurance costs only $12/year after watching a Gerber baby ad."

The GOP was out of power for a generation because of their folly. 1930's to 1980's - out of power due to their economic policies during the 20's. They held the occasional Presidency but never Congress..

"If only he knew that Trump would surpass the Bush family's wildest dreams.

At one point John Bolton was considered so insane that he was a pariah even among neocons. He actually wanted to do evil shit that the Jews never even asked him to do. Worse than a cuck.

And now Trump has made him national security advisor. It's like we're living in an anime plot from hell."
"We'll just have to agree to disagree.

I still remember Trump insulting Bush and slamming the War on Iraq early in 2016. Conservatives nationwide were livid. Trump refused to apologize and doubled down.

Eventually they single last one of them bent the knee. A shame he's sold out now, but that was then, this is now."
"The best thing that every last one of them is sexually interested in white men. Yes, even ching Chong Sarah. I practically have to chase them away with cockroach spray.

Americans are up to their ears in happy clappy sentimental optimism. What we need to hear is the harsh truth."
"The dead pimp Dennis Hof who was facing charges for human trafficking Eastern European women, also ran a brothel called the âCuckolders Ranch.â Â He was a close friend of Tucker Carlson and was running for office as a âTrump Republican.â Â This is what the GOP is."
"Puerto Ricans are like dumber, more violent Mexicans. They score worse on assessment tests than American blacks.

90% of contracts should be awarded to mainland companies because they're not a bunch of corrupt goblins. $130 billion for this piece of shit island is completely unreasonable.

Cut them loose and let set them adrift. Â¡AdiÃ³s!"
"Even the alt right seems to have conveniently forgotten that Trump didn't run on a conservative platform - he ran pushing a nationalist-populist agenda. Normie GOPers like Crowder hated his guts. They were NOT his base.

So far, other than half-assed attempts to renegotiate trade deals, and unleashing ICE, he has yet to govern as a nationalist populist."
"

People like your dad were always a liability to MAGA.

The vast, vast majority of movement GOPers are morons. And I do mean nearly all. They don't think critically. They are reactive and emotional thinkers.

So Trump can sell out and they're 100% OK bc all they really wanted was a Jeb Bush with a spine. If Trump wanted war in Iran they'd enlist their own sons."
"Trump selling out would be OK if there were swift and universal condemnation on the alt right.

Nope. The majority still thinks he's ""our guy"". He triggers the libtards so he has to be based. No way is he a neocon, even though he put John fucking Bolton back in the White House. Who is Gary Cohn again?

At this point would a Hillary presidency have been worse?"
"Trump managed to singlehandedly convince Republicans to reverse their nonsensical opinions on free trade and moronic wars - Ann Coulter was one of his very first converts. Conservatism had been discredited.

He is a very persuasive man when he wants to be. It's a shame he doesn't have the intelligence or the discipline to actually fulfill his own promises."
"He had skin in the game for sure.

If you remember his debate before the SC primary, he unreservedly denounced the Bush clan and accused them of lying for Iraq. The audience booed. There were angry, butthurt Boomers cursing him on his FB page.

You have to remember as late as 2015, morons like Steven Crowder were claiming ""we found WMDs in Iraq"" and other nonsense."
"Ted Cruz - the male Hillary Clinton, with the charisma and oleaginous temperament to match.

One thing I will give Lyin' Ted credit for is that in his short time in the Senate, he had a strong record of delivering on his campaign promises.Â

It's a genetic downgrade in every way imaginable. And idiot white people think they're our equals."
"On that subject

When Trump used to denounce the ""lying press"" he used to include FOX in that category. Remember he opted out of a FOX debate after accusing them of unfairness?

Now he has nothing but compliments for FOX.

What shallow, self-obsessed egoist."
"At some point in 2017, FOX News realized that they could manipulate Trump into doing whatever they wanted by praising him 24/7. Hence why Hannity and Ingraham sound like N Korean TV praising the ""Dear Leader"".

Remember that FOX was hostile to Trump during the primaries and grudgingly supported him in the general. Murdoch was also a notorious Trump hater."
"Plenty of brainwashed millennials too. I don't think there are very many boomers posting on TRS or DS. Even young people still distracted by this ""well look at what what the libtards have done this time!"" gambit they've got going on.

Yeah nobody in the GOP gives a shit about Reagan? He's a pariah in the party and his discredited views are passÃ©. This must be why you are spamming free market bullshit on my page 24/7."
"Yup.

There was no white, cis-patriarchal conspiracy to keep down and oppress women for millennia. Patriarchy was the norm throughout the entire world, even among primitive savages.

Guess why? Women are weak and unfit to rule.

And men who are submissive to women are especially unfit to rule. Which means nearly our entire ruling class."
"There was no utility in allowing women to work before the industrial revolution. Women are naturally inferior at hunting, herding, and farming. Infant mortality rates were sky high, which means 6+ kids just to keep the population stable.

There's no utility now, either - working women have few children. From Oslo to Seattle the white race is going extinct."
"The only kike here is you.

By the way, Reagan was the one who ushered in amnesty. Wait what state was he from again? CA, which has a Dem super-majority thanks to his ""natural conservatives"". Texas is next.

"I don't believe The Wall is anything more than a scam

It is a useful rhetorical device to get people to come out to vote ... so that the GOP can do Tax Cuts, Tax Cuts 2, welfare reform, deregulation, trillions of dollars in wasteful military spending, $30 billion for Israel, prison reform for the Koch Brothers, ending Net Neutrality for cable companies, etc."

And yet we didn't listen."
"Even Vdare is promoting this bullshit.

Look at the current crop of GOP candidates in Kansas - Steve Watkins (R), Kevin Yoder (R), etc. Steve Watkins doesn't even mention immigration once in his campaign statement. Yoder wants to drastically expand immigrant visas.

They're all cuckolds - like niggers, you shills keep supporting them and then you lose."
"The GOP has voted repeatedly to fund an Israeli border wall (which is technically in Palestinian, not Israeli territory!), but won't vote to fund one here. After all the Muzlims are terrorists and we must protect God's chosen people.

Somebody remind them that Mexicans are even more likely to commit beheadings. We have our own terrorists across the Rio."
"From everything we know about Trump's character, the man is a clueless moron driven by largely by impulse and emotion.

He only stays on course when there is severe opposition from his base. What happened during the election when he told Hannity he was softening on amnesty? Even Ann Coulter had a meltdown. He went back to his original position immediately."
"Makes the logic of the people who say 'Trust Trump, he just needs the right people in Congress' and 'Keep it to the primaries, you absolutely must turn out for the cuck in the general' a little incongruent, doesn't it, when their object of worship refuses to even support candidates who agree with his ostensible agenda?"
"Nothing

Because you suck Trump's dick, and think he's ""our guy"".

Because none of you showed up to support MAGA candidates in the primaries.

Because you will vote for GOP cucks again, though they oppose the wall even with a majority and no filibuster.

Because you think it's cool to betray our guys at Charlottesville, after all, they're wignats.

Fuck all of you."
"All Trump needed was a tweet to improve the poll #s of someone like Kelli Ward, let alone a rally. He did none of that. The cucks won the primaries.

Even legislatively, there were things he could have accomplished just by threatening the cucks in congress (""you don't want to go down like Eric Cantor, do you""?). Nope. He just capitulated without negotiating."
"I never cared about any of that. I would tolerate him screwing a nigger maid if he kept any of his important promises.

He has yet to do any of that. So far he's been governing like a down syndrome Jeb Bush. I don't count ""triggering the libtards"" as an accomplishment because that makes our situation even more perilous in the long run."

"Here's what increasing the minimum wage does - yes it increases operating costs for businesses. But it also increases disposable income for lower wage workers and youths, who shop primarily at these same businesses, increasing aggregate demand. It reduces the tax burden of illegals in general.

Again, it has to be enforced, or it's worse than useless."

"Yup.

Both the Dems and GOP are kiked on foreign policy. But they represent two competing approaches to Zionism among Jews.

Both are shit, but the Likudniks who bankroll the GOP are worse."

As for crazy, radical libs helping the right wing, history speaks otherwise. Fags, feminists, and niggers. Radicalism never hurt their cause."
"More on that subject:

The GOP might be actually worse on illegal immigration than Democrats, because their insane policies raise both the demand and supply of illegal labor - lower minimum wage, ""right to work"", deregulation. A $15 minimum wage would cause at least five million illegals to ""self deport"".

Oh, and their donors are even more pro immigration."
"I can't think of a single positive reason to vote GOP any longer.

Fiscal conservatism - nope, they're more fiscally liberal than Democrats. Trump's tax bill pushes the deficit to $1 trillion (!)

They're even more bellicose and pro Israel than the Dems. Pathetic.

"You can't blame Trump for his tweet and switch tactics. His base is happy with a tweet saying one thing and his administration doing the exact opposite.Â

I am simplifying and I wish that I could point you to my posts there but I was banned and I think the forum is gone altogether now. I wrote thousands of words on the subject.

Basically I was saying that being a veteran in one of ZOG's wars is nothing to be proud of. Perhaps you learnt a useful skill, but killing for ZOG is nothing to boast about. Then in the middle of all this Eli lied about some details of his military service, having claimed to have killed for ZOG - stolen valor or something. Had Eli been given proper ideological training, he would never have boasted of killing people that are resisting ZOG whether he did it or not.Â

"Greg Johnson is a smart guy. I like him except when he is talking about homosexuality or doxing. On those matters he loses objectivity.

We had an implicit agreement with the homos. We tolerate you, and you stay away from kids. The homos broke that agreement at the first opportunity. We gave them an inch, and they took a mile. Returning to the 1990s status quo would simply bring us back to where we are now eventually, even if that was possible.

Rather than do that we have to return homosexuals to the closet where they cannot exercise cultural influence. This means TV shows portraying homosexuals in a negative light (as much as they are portrayed positively now), negatively in an educational context, and so on.

As for homosexuals like Greg Johnson, we can offer that the state will fund research into the condition to see if it can be corrected or remedied."
"The alt-right not holding Trump accountable is perhaps the reason why Trump cucked in the first place.

"'Right wing (or Orthodox religious) Jews are on our side'Â  A common refrain from deluded white right wingers.

This stems from a misunderstanding of intra-Jewish political disputes within Israel, and in the Jewish diaspora as it relates to Israel.

You don't need to know much about left Zionism and right Zionism. All you need to know is that these two factions disagree on strategy towards a mutually agreed upon goal. The right wing Zionists seek an immediate establishment of a fully Jewish state, the expulsion of Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, and the destruction of the Dome of the Rock, a sacred Islamic shrine in Jerusalem believed by Jews to be place of their old temple. This could be called the strategy of transfer.

The leftists Zionists view the rightist strategy as reckless and likely to result in international condemnation. They want to stick to the plan already implemented, that is the slow driving out of the Palestinians until there are none left. This is the strategy that French president Macron calls the strategy of fait accompli.

When right wing Jews complain of George Soros they are complaining about him being for the strategy of fait accompli and against the strategy of transfer. Our interests are not aligned with right wing or religious Jews. Not on even a single issue.

Meanwhile they continue plundering the nation with their economic schemes such as this current bubble that is growing by the minute.
"Why not resign yourself? Wouldn't that deprive your detractors of their self-righteous moralism?

Or is it the case that when you have skin in the game you behave differently (see Nicholas Taleb).

This is why you are called a charlatan.

"Really the battles you are seeing now are between the ruling class. This entire battle with Kavanaugh has been oligarch vs.oligarch. They are squabbling among each other jockeying for power and using the retards in red/blue America to ""pick a side"" I laugh at the whole thing. None of this has anything to do with the people or their interests."
If Kavanaugh had not not gotten in then it would have been that Amy Barrett with the adopted niglets. These people are all corporatists that serve the interests of the oligarchs. What does any of this have to do with populism? It has nothing to do with me or my family and our interests.

Truly the power of the adversary is great. Is this what you people want? Lindsay Graham memes with red lasers coming out of his eyes while your family members die in the desert sands of Iran, while those exact same people end up in America as refugees by the millions, all thanks to Lindsay Graham supporting a Bushite justice that he has known for 20 years?Â 

Perhaps we deserve defeat then."
"And they still look like shit. Flat chest. Flat ass. Flat face. Flat everything.

LOL at white guys with yellow fever."
"Exactly what I keep saying.

You know what actually works? *Demoralizing* the left. Actual victories from Trump, combined with weak and ineffectual Dem leadership. Depressed libs wouldn't show up to vote in Nov.

What's funny is that the left isn't demoralized at all. They're convinced they can win, and they have the enthusiasm and numbers to back it up."
"Alt-right shills for Trump frequently accuse his detractors (i.e. the mentally sane) of having unreasonably high expectations. ""You're whining because he hasn't gone full RAHOWA!""

Nope. Actually, we would have been fine with basic civic nationalism &amp; populism, at least for the time being.

This orange motherfucker fails BASIC tests for competence."
"If Trump were truly under hostage he'd at least be sniping at ""the swamp"" passive-aggressively on Twitter. Not only is he campaigning for the same RINOs who refused to vote for his border wall, he refused to endorse real MAGA candidates in the primaries.

There are hardly any MAGA candidates to vote for. Stop being a cuckold and a shill for a party that hates you."
"Classic excuse from Trump shills, who at least acknowledge his pitiful lack of achievements in office: ""Trump is trying his best, but he's being thwarted by the (((swamp))), and he needs all the help that he can get!""

Nope. He stocked his cabinet with swamp critters, campaigns for RINOs for the midterms, endorses them, and compliments them on Twitter."
"The average conservative in America is an emotional thinker at heart. It doesn't matter that Trump has stocked his cabinet with neocons and globalists. It doesn't matter that he campaigns for GOP traitors. Nor that he is breaking his campaign promises.

Nope. Trump gives them the warm fuzzies and he ""triggers the libtards"", and that's all they really want."
"The American right has become so demoralized that they rejoice when they see someone like Trump sending the left into a rage frenzy. ""He triggers the libtards! Fuck yeah! We're winning for once!""

But we aren't. Trump has barely fulfilled any of his campaign promises. At some point, the circlejerking should end and we should start demanding achievements."
"At the end of the day, a country gets the politicians that it deserves. Hungary and Poland aren't cucking because their people aren't cucks, by and large.

Is that the case for the United States? No. Even leaving out white cuckolds and the loony left, take a look at Trump supporters, even on Gab. Comically delusional. They think he's their Messiah!"
"Whether you like it or not, Christianity and European civilization are inextricably linked. How it all originated doesn't even matter.

"The other thing these guys are just ignoring is that Kavanaugh is not /their guy. He was an insider conservative who hung around Karl Rove and people like Erickson. This is a major duh that these men would support Kavanaugh - he is their guy. This is not them ""finally taking their side."" Kavanaugh wouldn't know Enoch if he crossed him on the street"
I don't argue with fags who watch gay Japanese cartoons. Bye.
"What for?

Look at the current crop of candidates. They're exactly as bad as the ones currently sitting in congress. ""If we elect more of these same traitors, finally we will start winning!""

Is this what you believe?"
"Like you said - imagine if John Mccain had lost a reelection campaign to a Democrat, sometime before the present. Then we'd have a better Sr. senator from Arizona.

If this happened *nationwide*, eventually, the spineless GOP would have had no choice but to support real men. Otherwise, face extinction.

You don't reward cucks by voting for them. Ever."
"Or even try to do any of it. That's the key here.

Everyone with a brain knew that putting the MAGA agenda into action wouldn't be easy. Not with a traitorous GOP, incompetent FBI, activist judges, etc.

Nope. Orange Retard didn't even try. He signed an omnibus bill that forbids border wall funding, then bragged about it on twitter, not even knowing what was in it."
"Knowing this, politically speaking, the very worst outcome possible is when we have a clown president who ""triggers the libtards"" while achieving nothing else to show for it.

Liberals are angrier than they have ever been before, and are preparing to vote in droves, yet where is the legislation we asked for? What do we have to show for it? Nothing?"
"I refuse to entertain this ""triggering the libs"" BS, because as history shows, libtards are at their most productive when they are angry.

Ditched my support as soon as he did stupid ass shit, like hiring a Goldman Sachs Jew (who voted for *Hillary*!) to draft his economic policy. That is some cuckoldry.

You really think he is much better than Hillary?"
"It's a very American mentality.

The good guy always gets the girl. Villains always lose. We're blessed by God so our enemies can't win. We won both world wars and beat Hitler's ass, fuck yeah!

The problem is overconfidence is self destructive and delusional. We're not ""black pilling"", we just see reality for what it is, and these Ameritards can't stand that."
"How low are the standards of the alt right?

To win their support, all you have to do is throw a tantrum in the Senate. It doesn't matter if you're a sissy fag, the most outspoken Never Trumper before the election, very liberal on immigration, a neocon, etc.

Now Sissy Queer Graham ""their guy"", and /pol/ idolizes him in their memes.

All because he threw a tantrum."
"It's the most demented form of coping.

I think deep down inside, these GOP shills know that Trump is a failure and that he has wasted what little political capital he has left. But that's ""black pilling"" which is a sin worse than miscegenation to the alt right.

I mean they have to pretend that a closeted neocon homosexual is ""their guy"".

What a bunch of lunatics."
"Yup. And guess who's Trump's national security advisor now. John Fucking Bolton.

The very worst shill for the Iraq War, who was even considered too crazy by his fellow neocons. And a guy who wants boots on the ground in Iran ASAP.

It's not a ""useless"" position either, since Trump has done HR McMaster's bidding before, despite initial disagreements."
"More:

""Hey Trump. Can you not put Goldman Sachs Jews in charge of the Fed?""

""Trump, can you not waste your political capital over a stupid tax bill, again, drafted by GS Jews?""

""Trump, the GOP is full of traitors. So how about you help us replace them with populists in the primaries? Could you at least praise them on twitter? Please?""

This nigger ain't done SHIT."
"Yes we had such terribly, unreasonably high expectations.

""Hey Trump. Can you not hire state attorneys that classify pro-white activists as terrorists?""

""Hey Trump, can you be smart enough not to let a Jew who voted *against* you in 2016 draft your economic policy?""

""Hey Trump, can you end Obama's policy of funding Al Qaeda rebels in Syria?""

Etc."
"Alt-right shills for Trump frequently accuse his detractors (i.e. the mentally sane) of having unreasonably high expectations. ""You're whining because he hasn't gone full RAHOWA!""

"Supporting the GOP in 2018 *might* make sense, if populist candidates had actually won primaries against GOP incumbents.

Has that happened anywhere? Nope. Even Kelli Ward lost by double digits in AZ. Trump, great populist hero that he is, did fuck all to help any of these candidates.

The GOP in 2018 is largely the same as the GOP in 2016. Abandon ship, morons."
"Anybody who thinks the GOP is on our side ""because the libs are anti white"" is too dumb to be taken seriously. These people think emotionally, not rationally.Â 

What would prove that the GOP is on our side? Actually supporting policies that don't hurt white people. Not tax cuts for the (((wealthy))), useless wars for israel, and big pharma."
"Duh of course he is.

He's not the issue here, per se. It's all the suckers who are buying his bullshit."
"So what happens when the Republicans gain a majority in 2018?

Will you see a border wall? Nope. E-Verify? Nope. Reductions in legal immigration? Hell no. (The Chamber of Commerce won't permit it.)

What you'll see is even more tax cuts and boots on the ground in Iran. Do these retards live in a fantasyland where John Bolton isn't Trump's natl. sec. advisor?"
"You notice how GOP shills (like this follically challenged weirdo) never talk about protecting our interests. Or what the GOP can do for *us*.

It's all about ""punishing the libs"" for crossing an imaginary red line, or going too far with their culture wars.

Not only is this mentality toxic, it's a sideshow, since the GOP in 2018 is worse than useless."
"When these dumb asses started making ""1488-D chess"" rationalizations for Trump hiring Gary Cohn...  that's when I gave up on those sad sacks entirely.

"How can the descendant of dirt farmers in Lebanon (Carlos Slim HelÃº) immigrate to Mexico, and quickly become the richest man in the country? (And from '10 to '13, the entire world.)

"Over 90% of people in Argentina identify as ""white"", yet DNA tests reveal that they are over 25% non-white (on average). This is a recurring pattern throughout all of Latin America. This explains their poor intellectual achievements (hardly any Nobel laureates).

Our future won't be Latin America, because our elites marry up, not down. It'll be much worse."
"Note that when you factor out east Asians, white elites have some of the lowest rates of interracial marriage in America. Their sons are not breeding with Shaniqua and MarÃ­a. As the nation grows dumber and browner, so grows their power and influence.

Latin America is a different story because their elites aren't really ""white"" (DNA tests reveal all)."
"You're right.

Not even with the collapse of the middle class. All they need is an army of dumb, porn addicted, drug addicted consumers. Automation has changed the game entirely.

And like Trump, their kidsÂ  are also breeding with Jews. Ivanka's five children, blonde and blue eyed beauty though she is, belong to a completely different tribe than their father."
"This is how Trump has always treated white men like you and me.

So it should have come as no surprise when he hired (((Gary Cohn))) as his chief financial advisor. Not only the former prez of Goldman Sachs and a globalist, but a Hillary voter in 2016.

Why should I vote for this scumbag's party this November? To keep enabling kikes and honorary kikes like Trump?"
"In 1989, Trump asked a small business owner, J. Michael Diel, to furnish his Atlantic City casinos with pianos (at a cost of $100,000). He took the pianos and refused to pay a dime, threatening Diel with Jew lawyers, eventually settling for a small fraction of their value. Diel nearly lost his entire business and struggled for years. "
"I've said this before, and I'll said it again. Donald Trump is basically a stupid version of a kike.

Want proof? Who else would create a scam charity (the Trump Foundation) to fleece donors into financing his golf clubs? Why is he notorious for thousands of nuisance lawsuits, mostly targeting small business owners (who are overwhelmingly white)?"
"Trump is also unique among billionaires (or millionaires - we don't know how wealthy he is without recent tax returns) in his lack of noblesse oblige. To this date  his most charitable contribution is paying for a giant portrait of himself. He's basically a more incompetent version of a kike.

You fools who continue to support him were conned."
"That's not to mention a long and illustrious career as a grifter and con artist. Defrauding thousands of small businesses (overwhelmingly white owned), then forcing them into compliance with finance lawsuits. Two of his grown children married to Jews. Etc."
"Remember that Trump was always one of the billionaire donor class that has betrayed the white race. Do you think he gives a fuck about you or us? He should have always been treated with skepticism. Hell, he even donated over $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.

Any white nationalist movement that ignores class consciousness is doomed to failure."
"Wealthy whites will never support our agenda, because they rake in trillions from the browning of America. And it'll be even easier for them to maintain their privileges as the nation grows browner and more corrupt. When automation cuts the demand for high skilled labor, we'll all be finished.

We will never have our own George Soros. Time to face reality."
"What's funny is they always use ""muh pensions!"" as an excuse to import savages by the millions.

It's a farce. We know this because these mud people don't produce or create anything (less than 50% of adult, male African + MENA are even in the work force!). On top of paying for these geriatric old fucks, we'll be paying for the welfare of young savages."

"The ""le 56% face"" meme on the chans became popular largely as a backlash against this nauseating arrogance.

The actual number is zero. Oh, and he has yet to negotiate anything.

4) QAnon signs everywhere. Like herpes, it's a virus that just never quits. "
"If you've ever watched any footage of recent Trump rallies, just know that it's a complete freakshow. Takeaways:

1) Trump talks 90-99% about himself, and hardly even mentions the candidate he's endorsing. WTF are you even doing then?

2) Trump reassures his lemmings that the GOP will utterly crush the midterms. That's how you *lower* voter turnout, idiot."
"Signs at recent Trump rallies:

""Finish the Wall""

""Promises Made, Promises Kept""

These appear to be mass produced, so Trump's own staff are probably in on this scam. When Trump starts openly peddling QAnon garbage on twitter, we will reach Pied Piper levels of blind devotion.

"I no longer blame the GOP for betraying the American people. Considering how stupid their voters are, I'm hardly surprised.

Trump can sign an bill that forbids Congressional funding for the border wall, brag about it on twitter, and yet his supporters will come to his rallies waving signs like ""Keep building that wall, Trump!"" (actual sign, no joke)

"Trump is a political novice. He was elected with zero experience. For someone in his shoes, having competent and loyal advisors is everything. But what else can we expect from a man who lets his son in law and daughter dictate his policies?

I've never heard a single Trump shill explain convincingly how hiring Gary Cohn wasn't a tragic act of incompetence."
"And those weren't symbolic hires, either. Instead of focusing on his populist agenda, one that is critical to the survival of his nation (trade + immigration), the idiot spent months on Gary Cohn's tax bill.

Oh and who's directing regime change in Venezuela? Bolton. Judging from Trump's Twitter, he's completely on board with his neocon handler's sinister agenda."
"Idiot, his advisors are there to help him navigate his way through the corridors of government. That's 100% within his power. The Chief of Staff literally controls who gets to talk to the president every day. So far we've seen the following hires:

1) Goldman Sachs, open borders Gary Cohn in charge of his economic policy

2) John Bolton for foreign policy

Etc."
"""Trump didn't get to hire anyone until 2018""

That's a self serving lie. No transition period ever works like this. What you are describing is complete fiction."
"Does this idiot actually think that Obama had to get permission from Bush Jr before hiring anybody? Nope. Once those positions were left vacant, their salaries had already been provided for by the last fiscal budget of the departing administration.

By the way, what explains hiring Gary Cohn as chief economic advisor? That man was hated by *everyone*."
"Nope.

The president has the right to pick any chief of staff he wants. He had the right to pick any communications director he wants. Etc. There are thousands of whÄ±te house staffing positions that were vacant as of the first month of his presidency. No need for appropriations as all these salaries were provided for in Obama's last fiscal year."
"Nope. Not ""CNN talking points"". I don't listen to any cable news.

This is an actual quote from Trump at his very first press conference. Verbatim. This isn't a man with a big brain full of 4D chess strategies, he's a senile boomer git.

The extent to which MAGA cultists are willing to go to ignore the obvious is truly awe inspiring."
"What do you mean Trump couldn't ""begin to hire people""? The majority of his staff doesn't need confirmation by the Senate. And what explains stupid shit like hiring John Bolton?

Trump's campaign staff set up a website where his supporters could post their resumes for WH staff - he chucked them all in the bin, and hired swamp creatures."
"Look we've already seen the ""real Trump"". A narcissistic, incompetent moron who can barely speak in complete sentences.

The man put a Goldman Sachs operative who voted for his enemy (one Hillary Rodham Clinton) in charge of his economic policy. And he had the nerve to brag about his hire at a post-election rally. Does this sound like a man with a hidden ace up his sleeve?"
"Trump hired Rosenstein, who started the Mueller investigation.

He staffed his White House entirely with Never Trumpers and swamp creatures.

He wasted months on a retarded tax bill by (((Gary Cohn))), a Goldman Sachs, open borders Jew who voted for Hillary in '16.

He signed three spending bills that forbid *any* construction on a border wall.

Want more?"
"Nope, I was under no such illusions. In fact if Trump had made sincere, good faith attempts to enforce any part of his populist agenda, but had been stymied ever step of the way by the courts, Congress, etc. nobody could legitimately fault him.

That's not what happened. The man is a lazy retard. You want proof of this? I can discuss this all day."
"Trump:

1) Put a record number of Goldman Sachs operatives in his cabinet

2) Let neocons and his (((son-in-law))) direct foreign policy

3) Flip flops every single day; no it's not ""4-D chess"" retards, he literally hasn't got a clue.

4) Lies pathologically to his own supporters

5) Won't support MAGA candidates who run against GOP shills

So much winning!"

For American communities in the late 1960s, the only important predictor of rioting was the presence of an African-American populationâregardless of socioeconomic conditions. As Seymour Spilerman, the first to prove this statistically, put it: ""the larger the Negro population, the greater the likelihood of a disorder. Little else appears to matter.""

and:

Spilerman found that 75 percent of the 673 cities he studied had zero disorders. And even within riot-torn cities, an estimated 85 percent or more of the black population took no part in the disturbances.



I also note that this black-riots problem started on the heels of the Civil Rights Act, which apparently didn't so much endow civil rights as remove the need to behave in a civil manner.

There is something seriously wrong with this picture.

What is it with Jews and constantly lying about gas?
"My fellow Americans, we cannot stand idly by while kids are being sprayed off with a water hose. I asked Ivanka and she says the kids looked cold and it was sad.

"A must watch video.

Very few millennials are aware that George Bush ran as an anti-interventionist and anti-war candidate. In fact he sounds articulate and downright lucid compared to Trump on his best day.Â 

(Reminder: ""I'd bomb the shit out of ISIS"", ""kill the family members of terrorists"", etc. Trump said all this stupid shit even before being elected.)"
"This is exactly the thing - his parents think that he is ""hiding behind the American flag"", which is exactly what his critics said would happen to anyone else in the alt-right trying to use Americana and the American flag as a prop.

The American flag is a symbol owned and controlled by the enemy. There is no way to subvert it to our cause. Ricky found out the hard way"
"The U.S. is now intervening on behalf of ISIS in Syria.

"I don't need to illustrate my point with any more examples. The point is, we didn't just turn against Trump because he decided to bomb some rag heads.

"Alt-right coping: (((Cohn))) quits because Trump wants aluminum tariffs. I shit you not.

Trump promptly replaces him with... (((Larry Kudlow))). Who is even worse. Actual Kudlow quote: ""Plutocracy is just what America needs"" because ""wealthy folks have no need to steal"".

"As it turns out, Puzder was so revolting that even his own donor-cash-addicted Senate Republicans couldn't pull together the 50 votes. Why'd he even nominate the pig in the first place?"

""It's just a symbolic position you dork he has to throw some bones to the establishment!"" Nope morons.The Sec of Labor oversees labor visas, including the entire H1-B program."
"Alt right coping: Trump hires Goldman Sachs ex-prez (((Gary Cohn))) as chief economic advisor, a kike who voted for Hillary and opposes his entire MAGA agenda. Has the audacity to brag about hiring Cohn at a post-election rally.

""It's just a symbolic position and means nothing!"" Meanwhile this kike wastes months of political capital on a fucking tax bill."
"Alt-right coping: ""Stop black pilling us, relax! Trump's just going to cluster bomb a bunch of towel heads, flee, Assad will take over, and it totally won't cause World War III or anything.""

"Oh and my parents agree with me, unlike you internet LARPers. I'm in my early thirties, and I saw my white neighborhood in Orange County turn into a Ching Chong and Spic infested megamall right before my eyes. Hey at least they're not niggers, but I learned to hate diversity."
"Don't be fooled by Latin Americans who try to pass themselves as white - nowhere in Spanish America had anything remotely resembling America's ""one drop rule""; nearly all of them are contaminated with Indio blood.

It's why I'm so hard on infiltrators like Spic Fuentes. Argentinians are up to 35% native according to DNA, but up to 90% identify as ""white""."
"I live in southern California and I know plenty of white-passing spics. The great majority of them call themselves ""people of color"" and militate against historical white America. And they constitute the vast majority of ""Hispanic"" AA recipients at our elite universities.

"As it stands, roughly 50% of our new immigrants are Hispanic (low IQ, low wage laborers) and the other half are East and South Asian (mostly high IQ).

No I don't want any of these muds in my country. But the empire might not crumble for decades yet. If California is any indication, the organizational cogs will be greased just well enough to keep humming for years."
"What comes after Trump? Brazil might be our future, since over 30% of Hispanics (both male and female) interbreed with non-Hispanic whites in each generation. It'll be a slow and steady decline through mongrelization. Forget about ""le 56 percent"", it'll be ""48%"" and even lower in every decade.

Man even extinction is preferable by comparison."

"Those of us who are wise to Trump's incompetence were never that seriously bothered by MAGA shills on Gab or Twitter.

"Rickey Vaughn, the ultimate Trump sychophant and MAGA shill, was disowned by his own parents for being ""outed as a racist"".Â The irony is rich here.

After weeks of crying and nagging about ""optics"" the clown hadn't even managed to convert his own parents. If your own kith and kin disown you for your beliefs, how are you assholes going to infiltrate the GOP?"
"You idiots crying about ""optics"" fail to consider how our image suffers when you go cheerleading for a mentally unstable traitor who shits all over his own promises. How many normal conservatives have you persuaded so far? Are you even out to your own family?

I want nothing to do with shabbos goyim or evangelical tards who were suckered by the War in Iraq."

"
"Our liberal and Jew infested media isn't completely worthless. For example, thanks to their rat-like sleuthing, we know that Trump is obsessed with cable ratings and spends hours a day screaming at CNN and MSNBC. Many of his tweets perfectly coincide with something that aired on FOX or CNN five minutes earlier."
All Trump had to do was have an acceptable platform on immigration and trade - and he delivered. This fact speaks volumes about the shitty state of the current GOP. 95% of them need to be purged (at bare minimum).
"I don't want to hear any more idiots bragging about what a genius Trump was for winning the primaries. Running against 16 GOP candidates made it easier, not harder for him to win a majority -- in SC, he won all 32 delegates with only 32.5% of the vote.

And Hillary was a uniquely detestable witch. A donkey turd would have won against her after two Dem terms."
"If there is any truth in Michael Wolff's expose, Trump never even wanted to be president to begin with. It was all a reality show in his mind. He will go down as a black stain on American history, and if we ever survive as a people, future generations will revile his incompetence, his malice, and his misdeeds."
"There was never any 4D chess, people. I figured this out on election night -- after he surpassed the electoral margin of victory, Trump had that ""deer in the headlights"" look plastered on his face. Pure anxiety and fearful anticipation of what was to come. The guy never even had a victory speech prepared, he clearly ad-libbed everything."

So their silence about anti-Christian attacks on white families like  reveals that they endorse the impotent anti-Christians.

In their ethnostates, your children would be theirs."
"Here is the problem at its core as I see it. From 2010 to 2015 the alt-right was an intellectual movement. There weren't many members, although it was growing all the time. But those people that were in the alt-right had serious intellectual heft. What happened since Hillary mentioned the alt-right is that large numbers of conservatives have joined the movement without really understanding it.

They have lots of conservative baggage, and are effectively conservative + racist. These are the Ricky Vaughns of the movement. It is ironic that Mackey coined the term ""wigger nationalist"" (wignats) for people that disagree with his faux Americana because the conservative-racists really are wigger nationalists.Â 

What I forsee is a parting of ways because we basically aren't even in the same movement at this point. Nor is it really even possible to talk it out without coming under attack by people who are really very stupid. Good people are not going to hang out at TRS or DS because people are just getting shut down by low brow morons."

There was a time when churches in America (especially in the South) resolutely opposed racial integration. Bob Jones Sr. even gave a famous sermon condemning the civil rights movement. Look what happened there."
"And they opposed the fags in the most autistic way too. The debates were cringeworthy. They had no arguments other than ""Well, the Bible says"".

All you had to do was point out statistics from the CDC, ya retards. Repeat them until the public got the point. Point out institutional corruption in the social sciences. Fags are disease magnets."
"That was surely the dumbest era to be a conservative.
