"Three contractors are bidding to fix a broken fence at the White House

Three contractors are bidding to fix a broken fence at the White House. One is from Chicago, another is from Kentucky, and the third is from New Orleans. All three go with a White House official to examine the fence.
The New Orleans contractor takes out a tape measure and does some measuring, then works some figures with a pencil . ""Well,"" he says, ""I figure the job will run about $9,000. That's $4,000 for materials, $4,000 for my crew and $1,000 profit for me.""
The Kentucky contractor also does some measuring and figuring, then says, ""I can do this job for $7,000. That's $3,000 for materials, $3,000 for my crew and $1,000 profit for me.""
The Chicago contractor doesn't measure or figure, but leans over to the White House official and whispers, ""$27,000."" The official, incredulous, says, ""You didn't even measure like the other guys. How did you come up with such a high figure?” 
""The Chicago contractor whispers back, ""$10,000 for me, $10,000 for you, and we hire the guy from Kentucky to fix the fence.""
""Done!"" replies the government official.

"10 points for conservatives: 👇🏻

1. Pieces of paper did not create the west. People did. To be more specific, European Whites created western civilization, the rest of the world now benefits from. 

2. Appeasing the left, using their terms and narratives and buzzwords against people to YOUR right will NEVER make THEM, the left, like YOU more OR convert the people to YOUR OWN right, that you attack, to your cuckery. 

3. Your beloved “Set of ideas” and Government structure you like so much will be voted out between 2030/2050. 1 million left wing, LEGAL third worlders come from south of the border each year + illegals and “refugees”. Between 2030/2050 the majority of Americans will be central Americans, and they will transform America into a central American style, socialist country.

4. The constitution doesn’t magically enforce itself.  

5. A noble loser is still a loser. 

6. You will NEVER convince non-Whites to give up their racial consciousness. And they wont give it up after Whites become a minority. 

7. Whites will not become a protected minority, even if White's, statistically, are a minority in America.

8. Every race, except for Whites, has aggressive lobbying groups to give only their race more power in the corporate world and in Government.

9. You missed the canary in the coal mine: They were Zimbabwe and South Africa, look what happened to their minority White populations. 💔

10. It's okay to care about your OWN people and the future of your own people. STOP caring about the opinions of cultural Marxists, anti-Whites, democrats and other enemies who hate you for not hating yourself and START caring about the future of your OWN White children.

"It's pretty clear that Justin Trudeau is Canada's Obama and for that, my condolences to the good people of Canada. "
"Oh, Twitter... you never learn:  #SpeakFreely"
"Can we please just build the damn wall?!

"
"The fact that these liberal morons can watch the same video that has countless media outlets backtracking in an effort to avoid a libel suit and still blame high school kids for doing literally nothing is just astounding...

"
"Yet another verified liberal asshole using Twitter's platform to incite violence, yet somehow isn't in violation of their terms of service..."
Nailed it!
Chief Crying Wolf is still hoping to come out of this with increased victimhood status.
"Except that everyone presumed the black kids at the Lincoln Memorial were innocent, and then the video of them bullying the Catholic kids (even the black ones) calling them every name in the book...

"
"Since Democrats love talking about candidates past relationships, I'm sure Kamala will be happy to get this one out there early on..."
#LiberalLogic
"We have a senator who is a rapist. His name is Bernie Sanders. Is that how this works, Bernie - we just get to say things as if they were facts?

"
"At which point does stating that someone is a racist become slander?

"
"Not only is this the video that the media never showed, but social platforms have been deleting it... you know, because they wouldn't want to show the kids in MAGA hats being well mannered as the black protesters berate them before Native American man jumps in to try provoking a fight...

"
"Clearly, we need common sense smirk regulation."
"Aaron Sorkin told democrats like Alexandria Occasional-Cortex to stop acting like ""young people"", so she went on a Donkey Kong livestream and talked about Pokemon Snap and why the N64 is the best console. 

"
Because liberals actually believe they own black people and what they are allowed to think. #WalkAway
"Mom's face is the look of a woman realizing she won't be getting any grandkids 😂 😂 😂 😂  

"
These people aren't just mentally unstable - they're downright dangerous.
"Wait, I thought doxing or suggesting someone be doxed was against Twitter's terms of use? Yet somehow, this blue check lunatic remains on their platform...

"
"Imagine hating white males so much that seeing one smile triggers a visceral reaction like this. Then again, when you're a 'Senior Culture Writer' for BuzzFeed, what doesn't do that? #WeaponizedSmirk

"
"If you want there to be an America left for your children, there's only one solution: #NoMoreDemocrats"
"So it's ok for kids to stay in the locker room for the National anthem as a 'protest' but a Trump 2020 banner is offensive &amp; too political? GTFO with this crap, you hypocrites. 

"
"The rabid left is not only unhinged, but truly deranged. Just like with islam, they float these ideas of violence out there just waiting for one of their adherents to hear the call and make it happen."
"Totally destroy Gillette &amp; financially damage P&amp;G by choosing not to buy their morally tainted products.
Don't support any of those that support the ""child killing"" Planned Parenthood.

Gillette's new slogan should now be... 
""The Best Real Men Will Reject""

#ProLife #PandGSupportChildKillers"
"Bigots 🙄  

"
"I'm not a litigious guy, but do hope this kid and his family sues the pants off of every single one of the so-called journalists who joined in to lynch an innocent young man. These people need to learn that liberal mobs chanting something doesn't make it true and the only way they will learn from this is if it costs them. Dearly."
"Today is MLK Day, so it's a good time to remind everyone what kind of people his children are. Did you know they operate a for-profit entity named King, Inc. and charged $2.7 million to use King's likeness and his quotes on the memorial celebrating him on the National Mall? And that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cashing in: "
"Democrats have no shortage of unlikable candidates tossing their hats into the ring for 2020, so I wonder who they are going to screw over in their rigged primaries this time around?

"
"I wonder how many Fox News stalking liberals keeled over this morning after Ginsberg's ""in memoriam"" graphic flashed on their screens 😂 😂 😂 😂 

"
"""A crowd of teenagers surrounded a Native American elder and other activists and appeared to mock them after Friday's Indigenous Peoples March at the Lincoln Memorial.""

Despite having updated the story, CNN is still trying to make this bullshit story stick.

"
LEO's should NEVER be refused entry for being armed... hopefully the NBA &amp; The Charlotte Hornets are fixing their shameful policies that turned away these uniformed officers volunteering their honor guard services.

My favorite lefties right now are those who are still trying to make this a hate crime of some kind despite most of their dopey liberal friends already having backed down after realizing how much evidence is stacked against this fabricated event.
"As multiple media outlets begin back peddling their calls for blood in accusing a high school junior of a 'hate crime,' this POS is still sticking to his story. You know, the one that multiple videos from varying angles contradicts and proves him to be a LIAR.

$5 says he's a paid agitator who's job was to provoke an assault by a kid in a #MAGA hat."
"I have at least some respect for those who have publicly apologized, but still, why don't you idiots get the facts BEFORE jumping on the lynch mob bandwagon and doing your worst to crucify innocent kids?"
This guy is a congressman. We are doomed.
I guess the liberal media isn't covering the kind of turnout the March For Life had because they're too busy propping up a fabricated 'hate crime' where an adult male Native American tried picking a fight with a high school junior and then pretended to be a victim. #MAGA #MarchForLife
"""Millions of Natives lost their lives on Saturday... and what little land they had left. This is Trump's America."" - CNN 😪"
Weaponized expressions are a liberals worst fear... literally rape.
"I wonder if Twitter is going to suspend this verified asshole for telling people to burn a Catholic school down? Yeah, probably not as it's ok to threaten white people and Christians with harm, right, Jack?

"
"For the leftists mockingly saying 'his parents should be really proud of his behavior' - you're right, they should be. He was calmer and more tolerant of the grown man trying to provoke him than any adult liberal ever could be. He maintained his composure and didn't allow the aggressor to get the best of him... well done, young man 👌 

"
"We've got Americans, including children and veterans, being turned away when seeking healthcare, yet foreign nationals enter the country illegally and get immediate care. What in the actual fuck?! 🤬  

"
"Once again we must all hold Piglosi, Schumer and company 100% culpable and absolutely guilty of these murders as though they did them with their own hands and all others committed by illegal invaders! BUILD THE WALL!                                                          

"
"That's right, kids, liberals have finally discovered our secret power ...weaponized smirks 🤣"
NO. MORE. DEMOCRATS. 🤬
And who has gotten rich while in Washington? Spoiler alert - it's not Trump.
"Why do we continue entertaining Common Core math? This shit is ridiculous.

"
"Yet another piece of the deception falls into place...

"
"When Europeans began arriving in the New World, the native cultures that were present were technologically way behind with most still using stone tools, so the idea that they could construct a barrier of any consequence is simply laughable. Conquered, not stolen."
"Because the democrat hate machine has no limit on how low they will go. If you don't want your child, husband or whomever to have their life destroyed by leftist mobs and their fabricated accusations of crimes against social justice, vote red. Walk away. End the madness by simply stopping these people from having any sort of power over us. NO. MORE. DEMOCRATS."
Liberals want to destroy anything that is even remotely normal and decent... stop them.
"Wait, I thought walls were racist and didn't work? And what happened to migrants are our future? Oh yeah, Paris became a third world shithole just like we said it would 🙄 

"
"As allows, follow the money... this thing stunk like a left-wing setup from the get go and it just continues to unravel on them. #MAGA

"
"The few in the media who have backtracked after seeing how blatantly wrong they are are still saying the kid ""shouldn't have acted that way."" Acted that way?! You mean stood in place as a grown ass man walked up to him and played his drum inches from his face? 🤬 

"
"Outfuckingstanding 👍 #2A FTW

"
And props to this young man for keeping his cool as I would have physically removed him from my personal space. 
"Has this guy not seen any of the videos from multiple angles that clearly shows him walking into the crowd of pro-life kids who were singing school fight songs and not 'build the wall' and getting in one kids face in an attempt to agitate him? 

He's just as big of a liar as the liberal media 🤬

"
Numbers like this are scarier to democrats than a black man in a #MAGA hat.
"President Trump salutes as the transfer case carrying the remains of Scott A. Wirtz, at Dover Air Force Base, Del. DOD civilian Scott A. Wirtz of St. Louis, Wirtz was assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency as an operations support specialist. Wirtz died 1/16/19 in, Syria.

Thank you for your Service

RIP"

"#Felon #Liar #BetoComesOut #Cabal

Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke, who is seeking to unseat Incumbent Senator Ted Cruz, has been linked to a family that has had skirmishes with law enforcement, as well as the federal government over the past few decades, as well as covering potential ties to aiding drug cartels in El Paso since the 1980s, evidence shows.

O’Rourke, who is playing up a “family man” and “good boy” picture, is quickly trying to scrub or censor any mention of his family’s wrongdoings, as well as his ethical violations from public view on social media. The criminal-like behavior and history dates back to his father, Pat Francis O’Rourke, while he was Judge of El Paso county, and conducted in corrupt-like behavior, and extends to his mother, as well as his father-in-law for other miscellaneous crimes against the Government.

O’Rourke has recently been touted by outlets in Texas and national news as the starting of the “Blue wave” revolt. However, they have neglected to mention any of the information about his father’s and mother’s corruption, father-in-law’s bribery, as well as his own criminal record.

O’Rourke’s Own Criminal Record
Beto O’Rourke had found himself in trouble with Texas law enforcement twice in the 1990s.

According to court documents obtained in 2012 by a congressional opponent, and then relayed though a campaign ad aired in El Paso, O’Rourke had been arrested in 1995 for breaking and entering, as well as attempted burglary, in which he defended in a Washington Post interview stating it was a “prank gone awry.”

O’Rourke was arrested again in 1998 for driving under the influence, in which he did not defend, and called the incident “stupid” and regretted his decision, also stating that he was .

Another point in the video showed the then-councilman of El Paso publicly intoxicated dancing with a women, and then being smacked while lying on the floor seemingly enjoying it. The original video has since been deleted from YouTube, but Another video shot from the night displayed O’Rourke dancing with another woman at the club. It is unknown what happened in between the two videos, nor what is also depicted in the now-deleted spanking video.

O’Rourke won the House race despite the evidence put forth, and was sworn into congress in 2013.

Melissa O’Rourke’s IRS Run-In
Beto O’Rourke’s mother, Melissa, ran a furniture store based in El Paso called Charlotte’s Inc., which was a family owned business that has survived three generations of leadership.

In early 2010, the business was raided by Government and IRS agents, in which financial records were seized as part of a search warrant. Early allegations stemming from now-deleted news postings hinted that the business was the target of a money-laundering operation. No other further details were given through these sources.

In May of 2010, Melissa O’Rourke pleaded guilty to federal structuring violations and was ordered to pay $250,000 and the company was put on 5 years probation, according to a 2010 KVIA article based out of El Paso.

The article also referenced the following details from court proceedings and documents:

Charlotte’s, Inc., represented by its owner Melissa O’Rourke, pleaded guilty Tuesday morning to a one count Information charging the company with structuring transactions involving more than $630,000 in order to evade financial reporting requirements

The article also referenced the following details from court proceedings

Little clueless Minnesota children are being used as a political WEAPON by our Left-wing!

"You'll hear some leftists repeating this bullshit story about a Muslim death row inmate in Alabama being denied his right to a Muslim spiritual advisor. Here's the full story.

He was on death row for the rape and murder of a child. He converted to Islam in prison. He was in constant contact with his personal Imam right up to his entering the lethal injection room.

The issue is that the Imam was not allowed to enter the room, because only prison employees are allowed. They don't want to run the risk of someone trying to stop the execution. The Christian prison chaplain was the only one who could enter.

If an Inmate converted to Christianity and wanted his own personal pastor in the room, he would have been told the same thing."
