"Also had the exact same experience with ANOTHER prominent ""right-wing"" tech founder, who asked me to send in a resume two months ago and said that someone would be following up. Nobody ever did.

I don't mind not being hired, if I'm not a fit for the position or whatever other reason. What pisses me off is being brushed off and ignored. It's rude as fuck."
"Once I had a dream, that there could be an #AltTech that would be willing to hire right-wing tech people, and I thought that Gab was part of the #AltTech.

" Impeachment is not a criminal charge, it is only the procedure to remove someone from office. Besides, at the time of Nixon's pardon there was no impeachment happening anymore, he had resigned."
 That's 100% wrong. A pardon can be offered without charges. Nice try.
" It's easy for the Left to march in the streets, they don't have jobs or families. Don't confuse the Right's lack of marching and waving flags with an acceptance of corruption and child abuse. A lot is happening that isn't visible."
" Left wingers are Chaos, they go out in the street and perform futile meaningless protests that accomplish nothing. Right wingers are Order, they take over the government and use it to put their enemies on trial and sentence them to death."
 Obama can offer her a pardon. Accepting it would be an admission of wrongdoing but it would save Hillary from prison.
" Wrong. Flat out wrong. A pardon can happen without charges, as in the case of Nixon. Please learn some fucking history."
 Maybe you should learn some history. Nixon was never charged.
 why the fuck do so many people believe that nonsense??? Nixon was pardoned and was never charged.

"If Trump planned to prosecute Hillary, he'd act like he wasn't going to until he became President, to avoid Obama pardoning her.

" he called out someone on the right publicly and carried water for the media, imo he fucked up worse than Spencer"
" Media would have found an excuse to take offense regardless, people need to ignore that and stop cucking over it."
 Was it worse than six guys knocking one dude down and punching him in the head to send him to the hospital? Are you equally outraged at how dumb that was? Gonna call people retarded for not calling that out? I'll wait.
"Mobs of free-speech-suppressing violent leftists who put on masks to gang up on people and punch them in the head until they bleed in order to silence them is a far less important social problem than some hateful arm gestures performed by a dozen kids, according to media reports."
" you can stop signaling now, you're not on Twitter anymore and no one on Gab is going to be impressed"
"Have you ever heard a media progressive complain about violent antifa assaulting people to prevent their speech being ""counterproductive"" or ""bad optics""? Have there been any articles in the Failing New York Times this week handwringing about that?"
"If you're more outraged by ""right wingers doing hateful arm movements"" than you are about ""left wingers physically assaulting people and throwing feces at them"", you might be a cuck. Consult a professional for a complete diagnosis."
"The left was outside NPI in an angry mob, throwing literal shit on people and violently assaulting not only men, but women as well. There were several injuries amongst attendees. 

Meanwhile, the media is reporting on the REALLY BAD thing: a few young edgelords did Roman salutes.

Think about that."
 It's one thing to air a strategy disagreement in private and another to start signaling in public because the media did their typical bullshit outrage thing.
 Now you're on to the correct complaint. The media should have been told to fuck off.
" You're outraged about Roman salutes just like a good cuck for the (((media))). Cuck harder, faggot."
" I don't give a fuck about stormfront larpers. But your concern trolling about stormfront larpers makes you a shill or a cuck. Unfollow me, faggot."
"""Oh no, everyone has to be careful because if we do anything offensive the media will use it to write articles against President Trump to make him look bad!""

If that's your attitude then get fucking stuffed, you fucking cuck motherfucker. We got here by being real and giving zero fucks. Fuck you."
" If you think we birthed a goddamn Trumpenreich so we could tone it down and act PC because the media might get outraged you're either controlled opposition or a cuck. Go follow someone else, you disgust me."
If I had known a few scattered Roman salutes in the crowd were a magic spell to discredit any speaker I would have gotten some guys together to do them at Crooked Hillary rallies this entire year. Missed opportunity!
"Some (((journalists))) were triggered because they saw ""Nazi salutes"" from some randos at NPI, and now everybody's signaling, even folks like 

Protip: If you circumscribe your behavior to avoid being associated with anyone the media will get outraged by, that's being a cuck."

" Cops wouldn't even arrest antifa after they attacked the restaurant staff last night, so I don't expect anything from them today either."
There are 1000 angry antifa rampaging outside the NPI conference and they already physically attacked and bloodied an attendee. 
"I didn't write this but I did coin the word ""wageskank"". "
"""And it's not surprising the antifa get bitter, they cling to Harry Potter or Marxism or antipathy toward people who are normal or pro-immigrant sentiment or globalist propaganda as a way to explain their frustrations."""
Antifa are reactionary dead-enders clinging to an outmoded discredited ideology. Still Marxist in the current year? That's not who we are anymore.

"I did the Starbucks #TrumpCup thing wrong. I spaced out at the last minute and asked for extra foam and said my name was ""Little Marco"". #MAGA"
"Sure, you COULD go to Starbucks and ask for a #TrumpCup, but instead you should really pay your money for quality non-leftist coffee that doesn't taste burned and isn't brewed for you by literal communists."

" Ethno-nationalist is fine. But ""white nationalist"" is a non sequitur with regards to Europe, and in America almost half of the white people are progressives. I don't want to share a nation with them, why in hell would I?"
" I don't believe in ""white countries staying white"". I believe in France staying French, Germany staying German, etc. ""White"" is not a fucking nation, therefore ""white nationalism"" is a non sequitur."

" You're a fucking idiot. I'm attending NPI this weekend, does that seem like something someone gutless or afraid of ""white nationalism"" would do? Go fuck yourself, shithead."

"They banned me from Twitter so I can't push back at people tweeting that I'm a ""Nazi recruiter"", or a white nationalist. That's how it works.

For the record: I am not a Nazi or a white nationalist. I'm a ""Redneck Zionist""."

ACTUALLY, the phrase ""do it faggot"" is a historic traditional meme of my people, and it has absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality. Banning me for using it is a denial of my identity and is extremely problematic. I expect an apology."

"The great purge is upon us. But Twitter could have purged the #AltRight BEFORE we memed a President into the White House. They didn't because they never believed it was possible. Banning us now is too little &amp; too late, a futile gesture of impotence. Congrats fam. #MAGA"

" Yeah, I called Joss Whedon a faggot yesterday. 😂"
The real reason I got banned from Twitter: Growing too fast and getting too much attention. 
"Unlike most of the other people suspended today, I use my real name and identity on Twitter. I can push back and demand an answer. If I'm not restored within a reasonable amount of time we'll see about filing a lawsuit."
