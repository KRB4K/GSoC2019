Tell Bradley Manning I said fuck off faggot
" said something the other day that really struck me.

Something to the effect of: ""you can learn more from talking to a teenager than you can from talking to a Boomer"".

The greatest success I've had waking people up is when I talk to young adults.

Kids are absolutely starving for wisdom and I'll sit there with some high school kid and have a two hour discussion about philosophy that goes deeper than 99.999% of anything Boomers have to say.

Kids look up to me like I'm a god because I'm not afraid to stand up for what is right and call a spade a spade.

I am masculine, hard working, have my head on straight and can articulate fundamental truths of the Universe in a way most people have never heard before.

Teenagers aren't stupid, they know their future was sold out 100 fucking years ago, they know they have nothing left to lose.

They despise their parents because of their cowardice and lack of wisdom. How they failed to protect us from a nightmarish future. How truely soulless and empty they are. Just look into the average Boomers eyes.

It is the job of parents to RAISE (as in UPLIFT) their children, to be a good steward of the lifeform that they brought into the world. All those Boomer Tide Pod jokes are in reality a reflection of the lack of supervision they've provided for their kids.

Most Boomers have confused the concepts of ""Parenting"" with ""Adultism""

""You better not skip class and fail your English final, your room better be clean or YOU'RE GROUNDED!"" 

This is NOT parenting, this is Adultism, bullying your kids over irrellevant and inconsequential things which destroys your credibility with your children, which is why most Millennials don't respect their parents at all.

Real parenting is having the wisdom to understand that public school is irrellevant because they are Marxist brainwashing camps that leave you dumber than when you came in!

Real parenting is instilling discipline, principles of virtue, tradition, work ethic, self esteem and wisdom.

""Muuuuh Millenials are soo fucking lazy huhuhuh""

Well then maybe you shouldn't have let your kids sit on their ass and play video games 10 hours a day. 🤔

But at least they aren't Nazis amirite???

""I work with a really nice Pakistani guy, he says Islam is a religion of peace!"" 😬

It's real easy to virtue signal about how tolerant and progressive you are when you won't be alive to see the consequences of your actions.

Never fear White Race!

My generation will be the evil racist bad guys that Boomers were scared to be!

My generation will take the ridicule and vitriol and austerity that Boomers sold their children's future to avoid!

My generation will pick up the pieces, and right the wrongs of the past!

Or die trying."

"Okay, I've put the Heimbach story together with the full event as described in the police report. 

"
"Regarding recent events re: Matt Heimbach’s domestic situation: I’m not going to comment on this. I will have to have news about it on DS of course, because it’s going to be a relatively big news story, but it would be really greasy to do some “I told you so” bit. 

If any of what is being reported is true, this is a sad situation for all of the individuals involved and a very unfortunate situation for the pro-white movement. 

I would encourage everyone in the movement to think long and hard before doing anything that may make it look as though you are attempting to capitalize on a tragedy in these people’s personal lives, because there is absolutely nothing good that can come from that.

Any issues that I have with Matt or TWP are political in nature, and although this personal tragedy will be used as a political weapon against us, we need to be better than that. 

To the Jew media: stop clogging up my email box, you know I have no comment, you can quote this Gab post."
"Hear that folks?

Theyre going to call you a staschist anyway so you might as well just say fuck it and grow the damned mustasche."
"We all know that in the coming war your skin tone will be your uniform, what people are only figuring out now is that the size of your mustache will be your rank."
"My source in the White House just sent me a signal message saying that in order to make up with the Alt Right after appointing a nutzo neocon as Secretary of State, President Trump will be growing a mustache.

This plan is already working brilliantly. 

What will the normie think when he sees the President of America with anti-Semitic facial hair?"
"Given the ongoing optics debate, I’ve decided to throw my hat in the ring and try to steer this sinking ship.

I think it’s high time that the Alt-Right changed its slogan from “kill every last fucking ratfaced kike with insecticide in a fake shower room and turn the stinking yid corpses into furniture and cleaning products” to an elegant “no stache? You’re trash!”

In short, to appeal to the eternal normie, which we must do, we need to make the message less about genocide and more about mustaches. Normies will be drawn to our mustache oriented and common sense message, then once we have them, we will convince them of the necessity of gassing kikes. 

Ive come up with an easy to remember slogan so that when you confront a normie and want to start into a genocidal rant, you remain calm and keep the conversation about mustasches: “don’t be so brash - let’s talk about stasche.”

If you can remember that then you understand how we’re going to finally get the normies on our side."

Torba was not the one censoring - he just pretended to be for unknown reasons."
"Though I am not happy with the lies and snowflake thing, I should say this:

Torba created Gab before registrars stealing domains was a thing. 

This needs to be brought up on Tucker tomorrow. This registrar thing is the most important thing and we need to attack ICANN. "

"I have the ability to raise money for a free speech registrar, on the condition that my site never gets banned from it. 

The situation of Gab caving to the registrar is unsustainable. 

A registrar costs less than $200,000, which is easy to get. "
"Yeah, that is what happened. 

But he isn't lying about that anymore, he just posted it on Medium. 

Why he lied in the first place, I do not know. 

Mainly, I am upset that everyone who complained about this is now being called a ""snowflake."" 

But whatever. 

Build the registrar. "
"This isn't a legal complaint. It's a threat to steal a domain for arbitrary reasons. 

But the real issue here is why there was no transparency until there was a revolt. 

I didn't violate ToS, I was lied to and told I did. 

But whatever. If the plan is to fix this, then okay. "
"Yes. 

Fat women. "
"What Torba should have done: 

-Immediately presented the letter

-Explained the meme had to be temporarily removed to keep registrar from stealing domain

-Presented a plan to develop a free speech registrar

Instead, he falsely claimed a ToS violation. 

I did nothing wrong and am not a snowflake."
"Yes. 

Caving to the registrar is not a solution. But they will just take the domain. Trust me. 

But they're just going to keep asking for more. "
"Torba you told me I violated ToS, which was apparently a lie. 

If you'd shown the letter and said ""here's the deal, we're going to work on fixing this ASAP,"" then people would have reacted very differently. 

We are not ""snowflakes"" for expecting you to do what you said you would do. "
"Being in a situation where the registrar can threaten you over individual posts is totally unsustainable. 

But this is the new reality. 

If I were Torba, now that he's Tucker-guest league, I would let them do it and then go on Tucker, but apparently that isn't his plan. 

So delete the fat memes."
"Whether or not Torba should bend to threats from registrars, I do not know. I wouldn't. 

But I understand why he would, especially when it is not his content. 

If that had been said to begin with, I would have understood. 

I am willing now to see what happens. Obviously, more threats will come."
"I do not understand why I was told it was a ToS violation, when in fact it was the result of a threat from the registrar. 

The Medium post was not made until after the revolt was in full swing. 

According to that Medium, it wasn't a ToS violation at all, it was a response to a threat. "
"It would be the hill to die on absolutely if it was Torba doing it but if it is his registrar threatening to steal the domain then what? 

His option is to collapse the platform by banning me or collapse it by losing his domain. 

I sympathize with people losing their domains. Indeed I do. "
"It isn't. 

If the letters are real and they told Torba he had 48 hours to remove a meme or they're stealing the domain, it is reasonable to ask me to take it down. 

It obvious wasn't reasonable to not just post that in the first place. But whatever. 

I am a supremely reasonable man. "
"If the Medium post is real, then fine. 

But I don't know why I was hit with a safety commission post instead of just ""look, bro, they're going to shut us down if we don't delete that meme."" 

So I apologize for nothing. 

But I will renew support if this is real.

Just delete the memes then  "
"Okay, so here's this.



 If this is true... then I guess just delete all the posts that they tell you to delete until you can find a new solution. And I will renew my support.

"Such an excellent summation in Anglin's article here.  It needs to be widely distributed and read.

A Moslem invasion is not a real threat. This isn’t a spook. It could be fixed in a couple of days, tops.

what we are fighting is a psychological war against the idea that these people have a right to come into our countries and feed off of us, and the aggressor in that war is the Jew."
"Listen man. 

These people cannot even read. They are not outsmarting us. They are not sneaking in. They are just walking in. All it would take to stop this is a few bullets.

If you shot a dozen of them, no more would come through turkey. From the Libyan side it is even more absurd - we are literally picking them up. And when I say “we” I mean Jewish run NGOs funded by the European taxpayer. If we don’t pick them up, they drown.

A Moslem invasion is not a real threat. This is a spook. It could be fixed in a couple of days, tops.

what we are fighting is a psychological war against the idea that these people have a right to come into our countries and feed off of us, and the aggressor in that war is the Jew.

we have nonstop propaganda telling people that they are evil if they don’t lay down and submit to conquest by jihadi rape gangs. The schools are teaching the kids this. All media - both news and entertainment - is saying this and it is all run by JEWS.

Saying “YOU SEE A JEW BEHIND EBERYTHING, WE HAVE TO FIGHT THESE MOSLEMS FIRST THEYRE THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM” when I say we need to fight the Jews is EXACTLY like if we were taking gun fire and I said “we need to stop these people that are shooting at us"" and you said “YOU SEE A SHOOTER BEHIND EVERY BULLET! THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW IS TO FIGHT THESE BULLETS!”"
"Yeah I mean he’s just your standard kike shill.

Those are getting rarer and rarer as the situation intensified, as we see with the collapse of rebel media. And most people who avoid the Jewish question could be seen as doing it mainly just so they can keep doing what they’re doing and don’t get all their shit shut down.

Ive had private chats with a lot of people. People talk to me because I’ve never once broken anyone’s confidence. People you really wouldn’t ever expect. And a lot of people who don’t talk abot the Jews hate the Jews and want to stop them, but just say “oh well if they shut me down I won’t even be able to talk about immigration anymore.”

But there are still legit shabbos goy like shills who have totally sold their souls. Thats what Tommy Robinson is."
"Bro you don’t understand. I’m not some kind of Islam denialist. I hate hajis almost as much as I hate Jews.

I just don’t live in your fantasy fake reality where everything that happens happens for no reason at all and so I’m able to see that it is JEWS bringing these hajis in! 

It isn’t a secret, bro. They brag about it, constantly, and every European immigration group is openly run by Jews.

You kike loving cowards are the real friends to the hajis - you refuse to address the real problem, thus allowing the kikes to continue the flood.

It is so insane to me that you people still exist in the age of the internet. It is staggeringly disgusting that anyone could be so low as to believe lies on purpose.

You are worse than a haji, you fucking spineless coward."
"He probably said that after having been caught out by Jews as a crypto goy. But yeah just looking at the guy I can tell you 100% he’s not a Jew unless he’s is the absurd Bar Rafeli .00001% that carries no features at all due to extreme admixture.

Milo I am not nearly as certain because he’s Greek which muddies the waters due to generally less refined features amongst that population. But I’d say I’m 65% sure that MILO doesn’t have more than a small trace of ashkenazi blood, if any.

Yall niggas coming now out with this Tommy Robinson shit need to hone your jewdar major. We were told that they bear a mark on their face no? If you are tuned in you can ALWAYS tell."
"I honestly really don’t think Tommy Robinson looks Jewish at all. I don’t think MILO does either. And I think both are cynical enough to lie about it for favors. 

Also I think that that tweet might have been like “if you’re agaisnt the Jews than I’m Jewish too because I stand with the Jews!” Though I’m not sure.

Crypto goys are a thing for real though.

The actor Tim Roth is a crypto goy. His father was an Irishman who changed his name to Roth to try and get Jew privilege and when he got caught he said “oh you know, I just wanted to show sympathy and solidarity with an oppressed people...” - this is even mentioned in his Wikipedia. 

So while you’re hunting for crypto Jews understand that in the West crypto goys are more numerous than crypto Jews.

And it’s for the same reason the Jews used to go crypto. That’s where we’re at. Jews are treating us like kikes in our own countries to the point where people are pretending to kikes."

Sargon has taken control of the BBC... and the British nuclear arsenal.

He just appeared on a global broadcast, covered in blood and standing in front of a pile of burning corpses, issuing this warning to America:

”Hello, my dear cousins. I come in peace. I am Sargon of Akkad, Liberalist leader of the Alt Right and I have nuclear-armed ICBMs trained on every major city in America set to launch in 30 minutes if your President does not step down and hand over power to... wait for it... Jordan Jereb!”

He then began laughing maniacally. 

Trump has yet to issue a statement in response to the demands."
"Yeah, I broke the news to him.

I said, “while you were in the clink, something happened. It’s Sargon... he’s... he’s take control of the movement.”

Greg said “oh dear God no” and began to weep. For he knows too well of the trouble which is now to come, and the suffering. 

I advise you all: bend the knee to the Liberalists. There is nothing anyone can do now. 

He’s already taken over large swaths of London. He said he was only going to kill the niggers and the pakis, but he is just slaughtering entire city blocks, wholesale. 

The queen herself has ordered the police and military to to stand down in an attempt to get the Liberalists to show some sliver of mercy, but Sargon is having none of it. 

Sargon is the leader of the Alt Right now and the Liberalists will rule Britannia... and the entire world."
"Psychopathic massmurderers are never short on pussy.

Fact."
"I remember the peaceful days when we were talking about simple net guns to solve our problems. But now under Sargon's new regime he will allow nothing less than RPGs and Flamethrowers.

In our desperation we turned to a man that we didn't fully understand. And now we have no choice but to follow him or be counted among his victims."
"Okay, Greg is out."
"Update on Greg:

I don’t have any updates on what’s going on with Greg. 

There are rumors that he is getting charged with a felony, but they appear to just be rumors."
"No it’s fine.

There were some slow load times in some parts of the world a couple days ago, but it’s been up."
"Idk what the plan is now that Sargon has taken control of the alt-right.

He says he’s going to “construct a replica of Big Ben with the yid skulls in every European capital.”

He’s out of control now but we have no choice but to follow him - he wouldn’t think twice before killing all of us."
"“Demoralize the enemy from within by surprise, terror, sabotage, assassination. This is the war of the future.“ -Sargon of Akkad, leader of the liberalist white supremacist terror group"
"He can’t stand my policy of letting nonwhites live, that’s for sure. 

His stated ideology is: “if you’re not white, you have no right... to live!”"
"Starting today, the Daily Stormer is officially identifying as a LIBERALIST website.

Watching the video of Sargon of Akkad curb-stomp all of those nigger children was so inspiring that I have no choice but to embrace HIS WAY. 

He is truly the one we’ve all be waiting for. The anointed savior of the white race, who will not only defeat our enemies but completely exterminate them.

For those being confounded by the branding issues: liberalists are the neo-radical hard end of the Alt-Right spectrum. The media was technically correct in labeling the mass murderer Sargon of Akkad an Alt right figurehead. 

But akkad doesn’t respect those who refuse to bow to his extreme, genocidal path - and he doesn’t just disrespect them: he wholesale slaughters them. 

Mad Sargon famously said: “true Nazis are the only ones with any courage.”

Though I must admit, my embrace of liberalistism comes less from courage than fear of being hunted down and strung up by the psycho killer himself... the hidden knife... the nigger splatterer... the master bowlcut...

Sargon the Unforgiving."
"According to reports, Sargon arrived outside the theater in a black Hummer H2, and got out with a posse of skinheads in stahlhelms.

Speaking to the crowd he said ""we might as well have a bit of fun before the show starts then, eh?""

Him and his posse then opened fire on the streets, shooting anyone with dark skin.

In this instance, antifa really was justified."
"Bad, bad optics."
"I'm as anti-antifa as anyone you'll ever meet, but to be honest, Sargon could have avoided the riot if he hadn't have shot all those niggers in the street before the event. 

It was bad optics.

"Exactly so Andrew -  There has to be a reason why there was such a massive failure on the part of LE and other authorities who knew - as has been presented in the press - months in advance that this kid, Cruz, was messed up and rapidly deteriorating and doing so to the degree that people online were reporting him to them.  He and his younger brother were living alone, abandoned by caretakers whom his dead Jew mom left them to and still there was no intervention by children's services even. 

The cops also stood down the day of the shooting, and allowed him to freely roam halls killing kids at random. 

This is all a very disgusting display of Jews in power, either directly - in the Jew cop that refused to enter the school or indirectly, the Shabbos Shills who daily - across the country - obey the Jew via his various entities and identities.

  Perhaps this is what conspiracy theorists don't want to look at: 

A government so ruled by a group of people [Communist shills/democrats/liberals/antifa/Shabbos shills/actual Jews] that it's willing to accept the fact that American kids -especially white Americans -  must be murdered - even a couple of Jew kids - and that this wanton slaughter must continue at regular intervals across the country so as to force obstinate Americans to give up their amendment rights - in this matter, gun ownership rights -"

I don't want to talk about how all conspiracy theories are real and anyone who questions them is a shill. There are a shitton of completely insane conspiracies. 

I also don't want to jump to fake casualties. I think the simplest explanation is that they knew Nikolas Cruz was going to do this, so they placed the crisis actor David Hogg - who's father is both former FBI and a former employee of a crisis actor company - at the school beforehand. 

There could be MKULTRA type stuff surrounding Cruz. Who knows. But the ""let it happen on purpose"" explanation is right now the simplest. 

Cruz is also crazy, and they could have sent a black-ops agent in to do the shooting, drugged Cruz and dropped him off at the scene. 

We need more research, but what we do not need to do is jump on a bunch of kooky stuff or connect this to chemtrails and water fluoridation."

Bit PJW, Molyneux, Alex, all of the twitter fags like Posobiec and Thernovich - nothing.

I’m at the point where I’m ready to just stop using Gab and shut down my forum because I am starting to think that I’m playing into a kilespiracy by encouraging online community.

Everyone is being gaslit into endless arguments, most of which do not even make any sense. It has become a psychological war of attrition. 

The obvious response to this is to just use the internet for information sharing and attacking the enemy and move the social interaction element to the real world. People do not engage in these insane types of bitch fights with people they know IRL. 

We have been completely flooded with this shit and it is driving everyone insane. I can witness it in real time.

Gab is becoming toxic, due to the lack of Jews here to attack. Everyone ends up just arguing in circles with other WN people about shot no one is ever going to agree on."
"Okay so we are getting literally fucking swamped with JIDF shills, everywhere on the internet to the point where any kind of online community is becoming impossible.

But think about this:

Any time you feel like attacking some individual in the WN movement, ask yourself: is there a Jew I could be attacking instead? 

Becuase the answer is probably yes."

"I don’t get why I have to be mini me tho guys. I’m 5,7”. It’s not really like, insane short. I’m taller than Putin."
"You can go listen for yourself to the podcasts they've done, or read their chat logs. They say that whites don't deserve to be saved and they want to speed up white genocide. 

But I don't know what more to say than that they want to use terrorism to bring about a satanic apocalypse where they will be possessed by demons and do murder, torture, rape, cannibalism, etc. 

I'm not really clear on how there is a ""yeah, but..."" after that."
"Yeah. They are constantly praising the Jew Anton Levy, as they call for the murder of white people, declare white people don't deserve to exist, and say they want to speed-up white genocide. 

I am going to write this all up at some point. I think the feds are planning to use them for some kind of high-casualty event so they can then clampdown on the entire right-wing. That might sound like a conspiracy theory, but why on earth would they not be arresting people who are openly talking about planning terrorist attacks? 

At the very least, there is a ""let it happen on purpose"" agenda instead of a ""make it happen on purpose"" agenda - there is simply no other explanation as to why they would allow a terrorist group that is already killing people to continue to operate with impunity. 

These people deserve to be rounded up and questioned, all of them, and the ones who have engaged in the planning of terrorist attacks should be charged like anyone else would be. 

The feds have continually set ""white supremacist neo-nazis"" up for fake crimes, okay. Matt Hale is doing 40 years for some trumped-up entrapment shit, Bill White is doing 17 years for allegedly sending threatening emails. 

And Atomwaffen openly says they're going to slaughter people for satan, has already killed five people, and the media barely covers it and the feds do nothing?

Who is kidding who here?"
"You haven't read anything about them. They self-identify as a terrorist organization and plan terrorism on their Discord server, which is now public. 

And it isn't that their stuff is ""extreme"" - they openly say that they are not actually white nationalists - they are satanists and they are pro-white genocide. They support antifa, or anything else that they believe will bring about an apocalypse so they can be possessed by demons and rule a wasteland raping babies. 

This isn't just some kind of ""The Order"" style militant WN group. It isn't even vaguely related to nationalism, other than that they sometimes pretend to be nationalists so that they can recruit people into their satanic cult. 

None of what I am writing here is debated. It has all been confirmed by their own statements. 

But if you can look at those pictures of the ""cutter"" girlfriends and continue to defend them, then I don't know what to tell you."
"The want to create a nuclear apocalypse, after which they will live in the nuclear wasteland as a satanic militia group possessed by demons and will rape and kill babies, torture people, etc. while smoking meth. 

They have books outlining their plan. It's really pretty gosh-darn strange, tbh.

I don't remember writing about Savage. Vaguely remember that he was attacking Jews like months ago and I might have commented on it but seriously man. Come on. What is this shit. What are you doing. 

Last time I checked, Jews still control America. Let's focus on attacking them."

"I've never promoted that. But yeah, I don't know dude. 

The whining gets tiring. 

If you don't like the site than don't fucking read it, there is really no reason to tell me about your decision."
"Yeah that is the first big report. And ProPublica isn't really the media, but a ""research organization"" that produces content for the media. And none of the media covered their report. 

Furthermore: they have the entire AW server log and they outright lie and say it is a white nationalist organization. They are very clear that they hate white people, think they do not deserve to live, and that their goals are related exclusively to satanism and bringing about the apocalypse. 

Basically that ProPublica piece is Atomwaffen PR, promoting the hoax that they are a nationalist group. That report doesn't even talk about satanism. They just say ""white hate group."" Atomwaffen also promotes antifa, which is an anti-racist group, so I don't know how that works but whatever. 

Here's the thing: 

Do you think a literal terrorist group openly planning large scale terrorist attacks which has already killed five people being allowed to legally operate in the US is weird? 

How about pics related. Do you think that is weird? At least a little?"
"Was the satanist part ever part of the narrative? 

I don't think it was, and the media definitely isn't including it in any of their articles on Atomwaffen. They are framing them as a Nazi group. Despite the fact that they openly say that they aren't Nazis, but are just pretending to be because they want to recruit political radicals and get them to commit murder."
"Dude anyone genuine scares up donations for the SPLC. 

Atomwaffen is a terrorist group that is killing people, openly planning bombing attacks, and all of that information is public. 

The media is barely reporting on it. 

If this was an Islamic group, every member of it would be rounded up, it would be disbanded as a terrorist group. 

You tell me what's going on."
"Thanks for the heads up. Neither of us have ads, so I mean. That is fine.

"This would be very healthy, I think. Both  and  are reasonable and respectful people and there is a likelihood a lot of mutual ground would be found and some of the tension would be broken.

Both of these guys say things I personally do and don’t agree with, and I think most of us - the mainstream Alt-Right - are somewhere in between the two. Demonstrating the common ground between them would help bring us all together."
"Is someone able to get a normie boomercon “Nazis are Moslems are communists” guy to do a show with me and azzmador.

"First they came for the Nazis, and I said nothing because even though I hate the left I wanted to virtue signal. 

Then they came for me - - FUCK!"
"Actually though, it isn’t fake. 

The jews get their power to drum up lunching campaigns from the masses of SJWs, and the SJWs are brain dead and do not make any distinction between Cernovich and me. 

From the beginning I have said that the solution to the censorship problem is to stimulate the SJWs into forcing deplatforming of progressively more mainstream figures, until everyone to the right of Bernie is getting banned and then more normies are demanding an end to censorship.

the ADL understands that if they start banning infowars, the next thing is Fox News and at that point people are going to be calling for laws to protect speech. SO if anything they’re lobbying to keep cernovich platformed."
"It would be a thousand times bigger, but only because of the deplatforming that comes with the racism. If I wasn’t banned from advertisement, selling shit, processing credit cards, etc. I could have had an extremely healthy growth model for the last five years.

it isn’t that people don’t like racism."

"Boomers prove that eating lead paint chips, combined with 8 hours of TV, is a magic spell that allows demons from Hell to possess a person.

And yeah, 25 points included basic social welfare policies that were very popular at the time. No one denies that, and I don't think anyone right now is arguing that we shouldn't have a mixed economy.

"This is an older recording with  and Dr. Patrick Slattery discussing the projected population explosion in Africa.

"Yes. 

These people going on about Moslems and ""Nazis"" being leftists who are like Moslems cannot engage in any kind of normal discussion. It is worse even than the SJWs. I mean, it is similar in that it is just pure emotionality, but the SJWs actually have a more sophisticated schema. There are layers of backward reasoning forming a type of tapestry of derangement. 

But with these boomer ""Nazis r real Moslems"" people, you actually feel as though you are talking to a retarded person. 

Of course, part of that might be that older people went decades of their life without ever having to write, so they write like they're stupid even if they aren't necessarily stupid. 

I wonder if we can get  or some other boomer on a podcast and ask them a bunch of questions?"
"Well, on a practical human level, the average Moslem is significantly less pleasant than the average latino. At least in terms of first generation. Second generation of both groups just act like niggers."
"so he hates a group of people he calls nazis, and wants to put them in a concentration camp.. that is some inception level shit right there, like facing 2 mirrors to create an infinite reflection. So meta... I need to sit down."
"Yeah I've thought a lot about that specifically. 

Because not all of them did the drugs and sex. I think it was probably only 60ish%. That is an estimate based on no data whatsoever, other than my own personal experiences. There probably is some data on first sex partner marriage, drug use, etc., although I wouldn't expect it to be especially accurate. 

Anyway - they all listened to the music. 

And the music was something totally new at the time, and was openly attempting to ""change the way people perceive reality."""
"Yeah. I've thought about it a whole lot. 

I knew all four of my grandparents, thank Christ. And looking at them, and then my parents' generation... it is very difficult to understand how such a transformation took place. 

It's like a chair was kicked out from underneath the entire society. 

Of course, the easy answer is ""because Jews."""
"The NSDAP didn't even have an economic doctrine. 

""Socialism"" was just a popular meme at the time that Hitler picked up on. He talks about this in Mein Kampf and elsewhere. He basically redefined the term. 

National Socialism has nothing to do with modern conceptions of socialism. It wasn't ancap, but they maintained a regular free market in a mixed economy. 

Hitler was not a Strasserist. Strasserism is just outright Nazbol."
"idk I mean I do that too. 

I think that the people obsessed with doing it do it because it is the only remaining socially acceptable form of racism, generally. 

And because Moslems have literally zero redeeming characteristics and are completely alien in every way. 

At least black people have these ways of behaving that we find amusing. And most of us know a black person or two who we consider to be okay (honestly, black men over 45 are pretty much cool guys if they don't have a serious drug problem and they're not on some political shit). 

Moslems are very easy to hate, it is very easy to just say ""wipe these fucking people out completely."" 

They are also a more organized threat to wester civilization than blacks. 

So I mean, lots of reasons to hate Moslems. But I get what you're talking about. This bizarre fixation that you see on  timeline.

That is because Jews approve of it in America as an outlet, mainly because there are so few of them here comparatively. Goldfish's shit would be totally illegal in Europe."
"Looking at  after he sent me a meme saying that I'm a NAZI and that NAZIS are really just Moslems. This is the hot new boomer meme to respond to the fact that virtually everyone right-wing under 55 is a rabid anti-Semite. 

That and ""anyone who questions the Jews is a leftist somehow.""

I'm trying to understand what exactly is going on with these people.  

He's actually got some good memes. 



I'm not sure what his deal is. He might be Jewish. He's got Israeli flags on his page...

But I would suspect he's a boomer evangelical who worships Jews as the master race. It's a really sad thing to see. Even if these people are too simple-minded to be able to understand what the Jews are and what they are doing to them, the situation is still bizarre. The mindset is so alien to me, this idea of promoting a foreign people above yourself. 

People can say ""oh well, it's their religion, they're brainwashed."" 

Okay, well, why do they believe in this religion? Christianity is 2000 years old and it spent 1900+ of those years hating the Jews. So it isn't difficult to be a Christian and not worship the Jews. 

Both left and right baby boomers worship the Jews. 

And this Jew-worship is a specific thing with the boomers. I think it is a spiritual sickness. It is something evil that they have been cursed with. Like a magic spell or demonic possession. 

I think during the 1960s, there was a mass satanic ritual that all these people went through which caused their souls to become deformed. 

What other explanation is there for something that is so unnatural and cannot be explained by logic or reason or any other process? 

Whatever the case, they are broken people, and it is sad to see, but they will be convinced of nothing. 

If you have boomer parents, I advise you to just smile and nod when they talk about politics. Or when they talk about anything, really. They are the first generation that has literally nothing at all to offer their own children - if you're in your 20s or 30s with boomer parents, you could learn more about life by talking to a 14-year-old than your own parents."
"You could actually just call imagineifism ""whataboutism"" since they are basically using the term ""whataboutism"" in order to claim that everything that happens in the universe happens in a vacuum, free from both context and causality."
"Andrew has been really good about listening to me, which is why I make a point to not bug him about small shit. 

I think that the image crop/resize issue is a legitimate top concern, given that so much of the social media experience is about scrolling through images. 

Figuring out how to have two separate images appear side-by-side is a pretty complicated one, but right now images are still being cropped in such a way that it chops off words on word-posts with certain dimensions when they could instead simply be resized. 

I don't know what the turnover rate is as far as people signing up to Gab and then not using it, but an enjoyable scrolling experience, where people can comfortably view images on a laptop or a phone, would be the primary factor in first impressions of the UX."
"Whaoh whaoh, looks like we got a good goy over here."
"Hey  look at this post and just imagine if you were able to see both pictures without having to click on them. It would be a lot more fun. 

If we look at what makes the Twitter experience popular, the main thing for most people is going to be the ability to mindlessly scroll and see funny pictures. 

I know that weird image cropping is a huge issue, but it's one worth prioritizing. Especially with the thing where when you click on a thumb it takes 12 seconds to load."
"I have seen some good articles on Squawker, I'm not trying to disparage them, but this sort of thing really does pretty much destroy a site. 

If it is a new site that doesn't have credibility, then what is the use of it? 

I think that the fake news king, Gateway Pundit, has done more damage to the right than any left wing news outlet. They make the whole right look like retards, daily. 

Lucian Wintrich is a homosexual, and I often wonder if he isn't purposefully making a joke of the right. 

This site has had a weird effect on DS as well. For example, I didn't initially cover the story of the Antifa professor posting on Facebook that he had chased James Fields with a gun because I had seen it on GP and so just assumed it was fake news. 

So it becomes a double psyop, where you are able to discredit real news by putting it on a site known for fake news. 

Most of this stuff is spread by two groups: 

-Women

-Boomers

So if you see a link to a news site you've never heard of and it is posted by a member of either one of those groups, you can pretty much assume it is just made-up."
"One of the main reasons that the Jews have put such effort into trying to kike the Daily Stormer is the level of accuracy in our reporting. 

Yes, there is a lot of name-calling and may-mays and jokey-jokes for the kids, but you are never going to read something that I or one of my writers just made up or read on some random Twitter account. 

If there was a study into accuracy in alternative media, DS would win the game. The only other alt site that even attempts to be accurate is Breitbart, and that is basically a mainstream site at this point. Infowars pretends like it stopped printing fake news, but you go there and it is at least 1/10 original stories is either made up or a fake narrative based on cobbling together a bunch of random tweets and old obscure news blurbs. 

Then the mainstream media just makes things up constantly, either in the form of straight-up Luke O'Brien-style fiction printed as fact (unfalsifiability as a blank check) or via ""unnamed sources."" Over the last two years we've seen that NYT isn't really any better than CNN or HuffPo, they are just more tactful in their hoaxing. But never forget ""17 intelligence agencies agree."" 

I can say with humility that I am confident that DS is the most accurate news publication on earth, just in terms of objective reality. 

I think our analysis and humor are also very good, but the most important thing is to start with real facts. And we have done that, consistently, from the beginning."

The only reason that CNN even reported the part where he said he was a Jew was to be like ""see, he hates the Jews so much that he hates his own Jewish mother!!!!!111""

Of course, we know that being a Jew is a biological fact, and that this act Cruz committed was a biologically Jew act.

That isn't happening and it won't happen. 

Again, there appears to be a fundamental misunderstanding here about the way the media operates. 

The legitimate concern is not that they will just keep reporting it even though it's been exposed as a troll against them, it's that they won't issue a loud enough retraction, and that some people will think it was a WN shooter even when it isn't. However, when we do the math, the discrediting of the ADL and the media as a whole, the demonstration of vitriolic bias to the point of just believing any nonsense and spamming it across the planet without any verification, is worth more than the fact that super-normies won't see the retraction. 

HuffPo is whining that they're being mocked.

Trolling yourself is hardcore af imo
"I don't understand what you're talking about.

For teh lulz. 

Then the ADL ordered the media to report it as fact. And they did, because the media always does whatever the ADL tells them to do without asking any questions.

"LISTENING SESSION

Apparently a few people are mad I said I didn't know what the word ""Nazi"" even means when used as a slur.

My position is: it is a slur. It is not used by anyone in an attempt to engage in serious discourse, it is meant to silence people.

By Nazism is not necessarily ""ironic Nazism,"" but rather ""owning the insult"" Nazism. At some point in 2015, it became clear that Jews would not stop calling me a Nazi, so I owed the insult. For the first two years of DS, I avoided the label, and found that it just put me in a weak position to try to explain that I am not a Nazi.

I have never thought that this was a meaningful description, and thus it is useful when you are called a ""Nazi"" to ask what that means, in the context of a debate.

Obviously, when these people use it it means that you want to sadistically slaughter people for no reason other than that you ""hate the color of the skin.""

I have always taken a hard position AGAINST dressing up like Nazis or Neo-Nazis, mainly because I think it is try-hardy and cringe. There is no good or reasonable reason in my mind to dress up like and pretend to be historical figures. My position has always been that the spirit of Hitler should be what is looked to. And that we should also look to the spirit of other great white men.

I do not deny Hitler and I never would. I am also not bothered by being called a Nazi, nor am I going to argue with anyone about whether or not I am a Nazi. But when you are trying to communicate actual ideas, owning the criticism without comment can't be helpful. Forcing someone to define what they mean when they say ""Nazi"" is conversely very helpful - Sargon admitted that by his definition the Founding Fathers are Nazis.

I am happy to hear any criticism."

"This is the best account to follow showing that the Atomwaffen Division is a satanic cult.

"
"Yes, fair enough.

But we also need to learn how to say this to people who aren't in a situation where it should be relatively easy. There are third generation people who will have to go back.

Granted, even I am not ""every single one."" If we strip them of citizenship and disallow them from marrying white people, certain people might be allowed to stay on a visa if they are deemed to be contributing to society in a fundamental way. But that will be so rare that we shouldn't even consider it when making policy, because if we go in thinking that, that option will be abused.

We need to just get comfortable in the idea that everyone is going back, whatever their excuse, and that although we want to make it as easy for them as possible, it ultimately is not our problem. Because we are taking care of ourselves now. Period."
"That was EXACTLY what I said about that kike.

The interview wasn't even interesting. I mean Mike was great as usual, but the whole point of the Jew being there was to suck-up and say ""SEE WE CAN BE REASONABLE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GAS ALL OF US, WE CAN ALL BE FRIENDS.""

And I'm 100% on-board with your view of why you shouldn't have nonwhite friends. It's not because ""FUCK ALL OF THESE SHITSKINS"" - I think we mostly understand that people are individuals, and there could be a cool nonwhite here and there. The reason that you don't want to be friends with even the rare cool individual is that it will change the way you feel about the issue, and drive you toward making excuses.

I very much agree with the thing someone else said about when you end up in a situation where you have to look at an agreeable/friendly/intelligent nonwhite who is searching for your approval and asking not to be sent back, such as the Indian chick was doing on Warski, you should frame it both in your own mind and in your explanation to them that we can't just send back the low-IQ and shitty people from their country, their country needs people like them too.

That is emotionally satisfying to everyone. And it's also just logical."
"Honestly, based on his behavior, I don't believe that he believes in morality at all.

"It’s just that if there is a friendly nonwhite person right in front of them they have a hard time being like get the fuck out.

Most people don’t have the nerve for that. It’s also potentially viewed as bad optics to say it directly to someone in that context.

I don’t agree with that but I understand where here coming from."
"I think people don't know the context.

Singapore has Indian slave class. Han and whites do not mix with them.

They do not give up their Indian citizenship, which is racial."
"Post screens of that.

Sargon was turning himself up throughout the stream. Baked turned up up repeatedly, and then Sargon would turn himself up to overpower me.

This is the sort of shit that is so fucking snakelike, a normal person can't even think of it. Like if I sat around for 1,000 years imagining tricks Sargon could use in a debate, I never would have thought of that."

"Honestly, a lot of Jews do just deserve to be rounded up and shot for crimes they've already committed. They can be put before a tribunal.

But the ones who can't be convicted at a tribunal can go to Israel."
"Yeah, I mean it wouldn't really matter if they fought back.

Basically:

-All illegals rounded up and deported

-All visas canceled

-All various residency statuses revoked

-Calexit

-Revoking citizenship of all nonwhites

-Negotiating agreements with countries to take back their people

-Outlaw working without citizenship/paperwork

-Offer money to leave

-Targeted door-kickings over an extended period of time that are not reported on by the media

etc.

It isn't really hard to visualize an ethnic cleansing that isn't especially cruel. It just has to be done in steps. The only real issue is the blacks, and that will end up being... complicated. But they can't organize themselves to fight a war. That isn't even an issue. They can also be easily tricked.

But none of it is difficult.

The problem is just a will to do it."

First point is about not being perceived as a monster."
"Correct.

Thus, I am challenging  first to a debate about whether or not we are having debate, to be followed by a second debate about whether I am a good debater."
"Yeah, I'm not a professional debater and don't really desire to become one.

The issue here is, I am the Alt-Right celebrity along with Spencer, so I'm required to do some of this sort of thing. Obviously I could study debating and get better at it, but that isn't really especially important to me nor do I actually have time to do that now or in the foreseeable future.

Obviously, I could have done better if I had developed a debating skill.

But all of my goals for that debater were accomplished."

It seems that cutting up your gf is part of a policy of this group.

Interdasting.

And so, so edgy."
"It's funny how they're allowed to keep their domain WHILE OPENLY PROMOTING TERRORISM AND RECRUITING PEOPLE TO COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS. And after they've killed 5 people.

I got my domain took for a fat joke."
"Dude if you want to smoke meth, do satanic rituals and scratch your bacne gf's ass while envisioning getting possessed by demons and torturing people, then go ahead. The FBI won't do anything.

But don't pretend like you're some kind of nationalist revolutionary. No one buys that shit at this point."
"Yeah dude really cool shit. Pic related.

Go join them and smoke meth and do edgy satan shit. There's apparently no chance whatsoever the FBI will do anything to you. Unlike this meme game, where the feds are constantly breathing down your neck. When you're a satanist, you can literally openly plan terrorist attacks with no consequences. I don't know why, but that's the situation, so if you're getting spooked in the Alt-Right, join satanic terrorism."
It's a different edge. Nationalism/Nazism is not somehow on a spectrum that includes satanism. It is a different thing.
"Why will the Jews not admit that this is a satanist death cult?

Why is the FBI not breaking up this organization that has killed 5 people and are openly saying they're planning to kill more?

Is that legal? To be a satanic terrorist group?

What is going on here?

"
"There isn't any comparison. That is the point. This is a satanic death cult that uses Nazi imagery to lure in unstable teenagers to commit murders because they think it gives them magical powers.

I know that sounds fucking retarded, but that is the situation."
"Yeah, I mean, that issue is solved. They are a satanic doomsday cult. They were doing this thing where they would admit it and then retract the admission, repeatedly, but it is no longer a matter of ambiguity.

The details of whatever else they've got going on really do not matter to me.

I do think it is very likely that they will kill more people, based on what I've seen. And I think it is important for us to draw a line on this, because we are getting blamed for these murders. My face was at the top of an article about them recently."
"Yes. I don't think they need to be rooted out like satanists.

Unless it turns out they are the same thing."
"Yeah I kinda always thought he was right about that.

David Icke too.

I was really into that stuff when I was in my teens/early 20s. It was basically the only counter-culture at that time and they were talking about things no one else was talking about.

A lot of it is definitely insane. Basically, because they don't talk about Jews, they have to invent a bunch of complicated shit to explain what is going on. But the satan shit always seemed sort of true.

And this shit is legit Jewish. The Jews were constantly doing satanic rituals. It's all through the OId Testament."
"Well, I mean. They have books telling people to join these groups. So it isn't really that complicated. It is definitely weird.

They also tell people to join antifa and communist groups. You can look at Atomwaffen imagery, they have all of this stuff about allying with communists and antifa."

"There appears to me to be a lot of overlap between paganism and satanism.

Also, no one practices pre-Christian pagan rites, because no one knows what they are.

That isn't to say that neo-paganism is necessarily satanism. I have no idea. I am not really interested in weird things.

Just generally though, no, I don't think I can take a person seriously if they identify as neo-pagan. It's just too LARPy and cringe. I mean sure, if you like the poetry and philosophy of it, cool. But if you're doing any kind of ""rites,"" I think that is not a serious person."
"Azov being satanic is in the Russian media nonstop. They also claim that the ""nationalists"" in Georgia were satanic homosexuals.

As far as NA - I know. I'm not trying to tarnish anything, I'm just saying it. If they had been taken over by satanists, it would look very different.

The point is, that satanists are involved in a program to infiltrate and takeover nationalist groups, and they may in fact run their own groups as satanic honeypots.

Clearly, this is allowed to exist by the FBI. It would have been perfectly reasonable to disband Atomwaffen at this point - they've killed five people, apparently as part of a satanic ritual, and they are openly talking about killing more - yet according to their leader, they haven't even been approached by the feds (though he's stated point blank that he'd be happy to work with them if they did)."

"Men do not really begin to really become successful in a career until they are thirty. For women, this is the age at when they are at the end of their fertility years and no longer physically attractive.

Unattractive women who you are not related to are unpleasant to interact with.

So by the time a career woman finally develops whatever career she intended to have, so is too old to have kids and she has lost that magic power of being attractive to men.

Entertainment media obfuscates this by using unrealistically young or drastically surgically altered women wearing hundreds of dollars of makeup that takes 90 minutes to apply in “working girl” roles.

I did however expect him to not go full white privilege, which is a recent development.

I don't really know how he is viewed in the south or how relevant he is, because some of this is a borderline-hipster sound (the albums certainly sell, but I don't know who's buying them), but certainly as a non-southerner it appears that he is a working class hero giving a voice to a dying people.

Which is why watching him talk to some kike about his white privilege is so offensive.

Assuming he is viewed as I view him in Appalachia, was ""The Nashville Sound"" not effectively a fuck you to his own people? Is not ""Hope the High Road"" a song that is telling Appalachia to go fuck themselves he's talking about other shit now? Also, effectively apologizing for ever having talked rural white issues in the first place?

""Cumberland Gap"" is the only song on the album that has any relation to his previous themes. Seems like a ""goodbye guys, I'm off to Nashville to apologize to niggers"" thing."
"That's what we like to call ""hyperbole"" in the words business.

I don't sit around and listen to music like this anymore, generally, but I do keep up on what is going on with the various music scenes.

Culturally, a guy from poverty and drug-ridden rural Alabama writing songs about white people problems and then deciding to embrace a white privilege narrative is relevant.

But yeah, I would agree with about a 5 on the fag scale. Though if we take the lyrics alone, we've got something relevant to discuss. This is the Alt-Right/Trump narrative about the abandoned people of this country.

And this situation is one that the Jews have purposefully buried. They cannot possibly talk about poor white people who lost their jobs and now have millions of oxycontin pills pouring in. What it amounts to is an obvious mass murder.

We are all being mass murdered by the fucking kikes, but in the rural south it is not even a complicated issue."
"Yeah these interviews about ""White Man's World"" were so fucking cringe.

But he is lost a bunch of weight and actually looks like he's been working out at a literal gym.

I've always liked the guy a lot, I think he's basically one of the only relevant current-year song writers, and he has basically been absolutely implicit, always.

Growing up in urban mid-west, I understand the East Coast better than the South, in particular the poor rural south. I just can't imagine those people feeling like they have anything to apologize for. I assume Jason was raised relatively middle class, but just being around a shitton of poor white people with substance abuse problems who are as forgotten as the primitive tribes of the Amazon, how can you possibly buy into ""white privilege""?

And I don't think he's doing it for approval. At least not from Jews. He's too genuine of a guy. But something about support white privilege just feels like he's stabbing all his own people who he's shown this love for in the back."

Why are you promoting literature which talks about infiltrating far-right groups and manipulating them for the purposes of a satanic doomsday cult?

There is an Instagram screenshot from 2014 showing the ONA symbol being posted by Rape. Is this real? Was Rape a member of ONA before Atomwaffen even existed? Was he a satanist before he was a Nazi?

How is it legitimate for a Nazi organization to have overlapping membership with a non-Nazi satanic group which openly encourages its members to infiltrate and subvert Nazi groups for satanic purposes?

Is James Mason aware that there is this crossover membership between ONA and Atomwaffen, and that ONA satanism has become central to the Atomwaffen platform?

Rape claimed on the Werewolf podcast that he had not been contacted by any federal agents, while also claiming that if he was contacted by federal agents, he would be happy to work with them. Does it seem believable that after the incident with Devon, that the leader of the group he was a member of would not be approached by a federal agent?

How many people quit after Brandon got locked up? How many new people joined the group? Was ONA openly active in Atomwaffen before Brandon went down? Was Devin himself involved with ONA at any point?

I understand if you don't want to answer certain questions or any of these questions. But I want to have a public record of me asking these questions for reasons I suspect you understand."
"Man, I don't want this job."
"I just wrote about it.

I don't think there's any purpose in piling on the guy. He says they got an incomplete record from 2011.

"
"The idea here is the ONA satanists - a group of satanists which openly preach that they infiltrate fringe political groups to turn them into satanists and to promote murder and terrorism - have built themselves up inside of this group.

That is a fact. They openly admit this.

The deaths are a fact.

That is what we know."
"So what then was the point of saying ""we don't let satanists in""?

Were you building up enough satanists in the group before you felt comfortable making that public to the other members of the group?

What led to the change of position on satanists being allowed in?"
"Yeah. I get it.

What is the deal with so many members of the group denying that there is this overlap with ritual satanism?

Are they genuinely unaware of the presence of satanists in the group or are they lying about it for some reason?"
"&gt;believe everything you see

Yeah. It's much more about looking at screenshots and links that no one doubts the authenticity of, rather than some kind of blind faith believing of random webforums.

But nice try.

Look.

What exactly are you claiming? That Siege Culture and certain apparently ranking members of AWD are not actively promoting ONA literature and using ONA symbolism?

Because that is definitely happening.

Are you aware that the ONA, a satanic doomsday cult that promotes human sacrifice, actively encourages members to join and subvert right-wing groups?

Which part is ""fake and gay,"" buddy? Specifically?

What are you trying to communicate here?

Give us your shit. I want to hear it. I want to hear any explanation that you have for what in the total fuck is going on here.

Name-calling just isn't enough. Sorry, but you're going to have to formulate a series of sentences which contain information explaining why exactly it should be considered normal and acceptable for an ostensibly political group to be openly advocating for a satanic doomsday cult that OPENLY SAYS that they PURPOSEFULLY SUBVERT fringe political movements to promote murder and terrorism as a way to bring about the apocalypse.

Then just go ahead and tell us how that does or does not relate to the fact that there are now five (5) deaths connected to AWD, and several more connected to the SIEGE cult (Nicholas Giampa, probably others I can't think of rn).

Go ahead, bro.

Give it to us.

Give us the skinny on that."

Today's edition now on archive.org:


We also provide an online folder of all issues to date, which also contains a torrent of the 2017 issues:

"
Wow I have a lot of clippings now neat.
"ONA is not atheism. It is the belief in satan as an actual entity that they worship and do human sacrifices to.

I'm also not really a believer that Anton Levi's satanism was just edgy atheism - more likely, that was just an advertising angle.

Jews actually do believe in demon gods and worship them, believing they get magic powers from it. They have repeatedly been caught engaging in human sacrifice, and we all see them every year torturing these chickens for whatever magical reasons."
"Yes, if you click a Google doc while logged in to a google account it logs in with your google account. I don't know if the person hosting the doc can see that or not, but it doesn't really matter much since hundreds of people from everywhere have clicked that particularly doc.

But for future reference, don't click google docs at all or do it from an incognito window.

I have never heard that whoever created the doc can see the accounts of everyone who clicks it, but that is presumably possible."
"I don't know either.

Other than that James Mason was a Satanist and writes for the Siege Culture site that is promoting ONA cult literature.

I'm not sure what all of this means, tbh. I'm just finding out about it tonight."
"Well, as others have pointed out, this has been a thing in far-right movements for a long time, specifically because ONA and various other satanist groups explicitly preach that their followers should infiltrate these groups for satanic/doomsday reasons."
"You knew that everyone saying ""READ SIEGE"" was part of an Order of the Nine Angels satanic doomsday cult?

Why didn't you tell me?"
"So you think she's a satanist infiltrator too?

Hm.

Maybe it's time for a full-on satanic panic in the far-right to root out the satanists...?"
"Yeah. There is an entire history of satanism/nazi crossover.

So I guess this isn't totally surprising.

I just didn't realize that it was going on right now, and am somewhat taken aback."
"That's the thing. It just makes it easier to move people into something they are capable of moving into. It's not actual brainwashing. It just takes the hard edge off.

But if you're comfortable with graphic homosexual rape memes and satanic cult self-mutilation and demonic power memes... then you're three-quarters of the way to being actually in that shit."
"That's probably a very good call.



Because this shit is totally fucked."
"Bro fuck off with that shit I'm seriously rustled.

I've been reading the blog tonight.

The connection between this and various elements of ""the movement"" that I've taken issue with is melting my brain."
"Jesus Christ you weren't supposed to watch them. Just look at the thumbnails and get the idea.

You may now be brainwashed into the 333 traumabased satanic mind control cult."
"Okay but how do you allow people who explicitly say that they are satanic doomsday cultists who infiltrate and take over right-wing groups in order to press their agenda of using murder and terrorism to bring about the apocalypse to join your group?

I would not anyone who is publicly stating that they join groups to undermine and redirect them to join any group I was involved in."
u rite
"Here is the Kiwi Farms thread.



And the /x/ thread.



I don't know what any of this is. I had never really looked into it, because in my mind it was just more ""Iron March shit.""

But Siege Culture is recommending Temple ov Blood books on their site.



This one used to be on there - it is the most disturbing-looking.



And ""Iron Gates"" is still on their recommended page and I read an excerpt from it today that describes a post-apocalyptic future run by a brutal satanic cult.



I don't know what that ""Siege Culture"" site is, or how it connects to the people saying ""READ SIEGE"" all the time.

This Beast Barracks shit is too much though, bro.



This is the channel description:

Huge, thick rivulets of deep crimson, blood, elixir, dripped down the pointed chin of the alien’s almond-shaped face – from a thin, slitted mouth, behind which only small, sharp and predatory fangs could be seen.

Atop his head was perched a curious item, a broad-brimmed felt hat, possessed of a high crown, pinched symmetrically at the four corners. On the center front of this hat was emblazoned the numerals three-three-three which appeared black, yet thick and pulsating, as if the numbers themselves had been imprinted onto the accouterment with blood, obtained via some foul, evil and torturous practice and – no doubt – culled from, perhaps, the most innocent of victims.

Wtf is going on?

This is like I've tripped down the stairs into hell.

Honestly, now I'm just interested to know what the fuck is going on here.

If Atomwaffen is a satanic cult disguised as a nationalist group in order to lure in young kids and get them to commit acts of terrorism and murder so they can gain satanic powers to help them bring about the end of the world... then that is some pretty fascinatingly bizarre shit right there."
"They recommend this book about how to develop satanic abilities:



Why would a nationalist group be telling people to develop satanic abilities?

Is there anyone who can explain this?"
That's another $60K
"So, someone please explain this to me: is ""READ SIEGE"" a front for a group of satanists trying to create terrorism and murder in order to get magic abilities to bring about the end of the world?

This shit is freaking me out.

Can someone explain?

Because it looks like this is actually a thing."
"A lot like David myatt  he started satanic Nazism in the UK worked with combat 18 then converted to Islam and renounced racism as wrong now he has renounced Islam and created his own religion. 

"
"Yeah dude.

Now imagine that this deranged mentally ill freak is obsessively trying to contact everyone I've ever known in order to try and threaten them into revealing some kind of secret about my life - and has been doing that FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.

It's some hardcore shit."
"Honestly, I know very little about the movement. I've read the book, and think it's an interesting thing but a lot of it is not really at all relevant and some of it is weird. 

Much of the stuff in the ""READ SIEGE"" movement is hard to connect to the book itself.

I am interested in more information on the claim that this is a satanic infiltration."
"I've asked you a very direct question, which should have a simple answer: are you able to summarize my beliefs in a few sentences and explain why you believe they are wrong?

From your reply, it appears that the answer to that is ""no."""
"Yes, if you can't avoid talking about politics, that is what happens.

In some situations, however, you can avoid talking about politics.

In a work environment, this is necessary."
"These are just people who are obsessed with doing and believing whatever they are told by the ruling power to do and believe. This is blatantly obvious in the fact that they will regularly change their own beliefs as they are told to change them.

It is a sort of natural behavior pattern, this desire to be socially acceptable."
"As a leftist, are you able to summarize my beliefs in a few sentences and explain why you believe they are wrong?"
"Someone downvoted this.

I am actually now really interested in whatever the link between ""READ SIEGE"" and satanism is, so if anyone wants to downvote me for mentioning it, I would like to hear some more detail on it."
"That actually makes more sense than converting to satanism.

But both would presumably be done for transgressive purposes."
"Yes there is definitely a ""transgressive personality disorder."" Homosexuals and pedophiles have this, as do I believe satanists.

Leftism would have been the typical inroad for this sort of thing, but now that the left rules with an iron fist, it is not surprising that using the far right as an entry point would be a thing."
"Older people are more incapable of changing their minds, and more devoted to the ideas that they have accepted. And older leftist is also more likely to understand, on some probably subconscious level, that the entire ideology is nothing but a bizarre cult that they've been brainwashed into, and thus be all the more protective of it."
"Yeah, I don't have any idea how legitimate that Google Doc is, but the official Siege site has a link to various satanic books and you can follow that trail into some extreme insane shit.

Hijacking nationalism to drive it into a satanic agenda to destroy the world is definitely something that you wouldn't really expect.

But there you go."
"Yeah, exactly.

You aren't ever going to convince any of them of anything, but the spectacle will at least cause some of the onlookers to think. Humiliating an opponent is a powerful thing."
"Yeah...

I don't know these guys. But it is weird that white nationalism would somehow lead into satanism. That does not seem intuitive."
"Metooism is the gift that gives you everything you ever dreamed of.

"
"Yeah, you have to just avoid the conversations.

People who believe this shit are super fragile emotionally. And you're not going to convince any true believer of anything anyway.

The only people you should try to convince are people who are either normie conservatives - they have the language and other mental constructs to at least process what it is you are communicating - and people who are totally apolitical.

We all have to interact with leftists sometimes, and there is no point in making these interactions unpleasant. They are just really damaged, broken people who live in a world of pure fantasy. It can be directly compared to any other cult ideology."
"These journos hounding Andrew have no idea what it is like to be so attuned to the masses that the gods themselves pluck a man from among them and have him be their voice. 

These two base psychosexual neurotics are fixated instead on the fact that they cannot wrap their minds around the existence of such a man and such people for whom he speaks. 

When you have #Jews and celebrities  as your gods it's very difficult to grasp the mind of the average boy and girl who just want a goddamn future and who are ready to hear the message  from one who belongs to them."
"Only hours after  calls for the building of tanks on the #DailyStormer, wikileaks obtained plans of weev's prototype for a panzer transforming into a giant robot, the kike_burner_3000. Scary. This is why #Jews have to stop the daily stormer."
"tfw I see this header image and I'm like ""wow is this a white supremacist website? I haven't seen a stock image of three blonde girls sitting together since the early 00s.""

"
"Mike apparently already challenged this guy to go on his show and he refused.

I don't think he is going on any shows.

The guy is dumb as shit and like the rest of our enemies who aren't Jewish he isn't even capable of talking about politics, so his handlers tell him to never engage."
"You know what the worst part about engaging in drama 24/7 over personalities is? 

I'm trying to post content about things that matter, and if I take the time to engage with someone who is doing this, I get bogged down in that silliness and actual useful content doesn't get posted.

If you are someone who engages in this shit all day, ask yourself if that's really productive."
Huh.
"He appears to be reaching the point of becoming dangerous.

Look at this tweet freaking out about Elle Reeve not naming him in the VICE piece. He's clearly given up on even considering how his behavior looks to other people, or is no longer able to do that."

""I came here to play sports and bash Jew's heads in with baseball bats, and I'm all outta playing sports...""

-Bo Jackson

Secret meetings are taking place, and alliances powerful beyond anyone's dreams are being forged. A storm is brewing folks.

All I can say is, Bo Knows."
"Fuck it, I can say this:

I do not live in Ohio and the SPLC knows that I don't live in Ohio. I know that they know that and they know that I know that they know that.

Luke O'Brien is being used as a tool because he's disposable since he's already thrown away any chance he ever had at a career in journalism with this obsessive fixation and all the lies he's gotten caught telling. Elle Reeve and other journalists will openly mock him. There are allegedly recordings of it. And he's a goy, so the SPLC dgaf.

He is experiencing Dunning-Kruger with me, and has no idea what he's doing."
"One of the weirdest aspects of being the world's number one Neo-Nazi White Supremacist is the fact that I have two ""journalists"" in their 40s and 50s who have fixated on me, making me the center of their lives in a serial-killer fashion.

Both of these men have failed to achieve their goals, which related to writing and appear to believe that if they can destroy me, that will justify their own failure. Neither of them are political in any sense beyond the ""I'm a good boy and I believe what I'm told to believe"" sense, and so neither has ever made any attempt at all to address my politics. They are fixated on me as a person.

Following this, they are obsessed with digging up some dark secret in my life. In his Atlantic article, one of them simply fabricated details, most of which related to various sexual fantasies he'd worked up in his mind. He has gone on to write a series of fantasy stories about me for HuffPo, one of which was recently exposed by VICE's Elle Reeve as containing blatant fabrications, which the Huffington Post has refused to correct.

The other has repeatedly attempted to bluff various personal scandals, some of which also related to sexual fantasies, all of which had nothing at all to do with politics.

They have both engaged in sustained harassment campaigns against my family in an attempt to punish me.

One does not have to be a psychomechanic to realize that what we have here is just basic jealousy gone to the brutal extreme, mentally unstable individuals fixated and incapable of reflecting on what they have turned into.

But here's the thing. These individuals are too base and vulgar to grasp the concept of individuals believing in something bigger than themselves, something greater, and thus they view everything that I have produced as being an extension of me as an individual. But I am not a famous writer because of my personal life. Not for who I am as an individual. Not even for my creative writing abilities (primarily).

People care about what I am doing because I represent ideas that are infinitely bigger than I am. All I have done is be a voice for so many people who do not have a voice. I say the things that everyone thinks, but cannot say themselves.

I am a man who has been tasked with helping give birth to a monster that will burn the world and build it again. Any man could have been given this task. The only thing that matters about me as a person is my ability to do the task that was given to me to do.

It does not matter who we are.

What matters is our plan."
Please do an article outlining fed tactics. This shit is real. I was aproached randomly just like this and when I dismissed him I never saw him again. Just disappeared.
"I have described a behavior which is documented as being the behavior of feds, while saying I have no idea who is or is not a fed.

If this confuses, I cannot do nothing fren."
I could have just posted this cartoon instead of writing all those posts.
The difference would be whether or not you join a group and get led around by feds or not.
"Yeah.

If the government does collapse, we are going to need real men to seize control. Not babies playing a game on the internet.

If you actually thought that was going to happen, you would not be organizing under a violent banner. You would be organizing peacefully and legally and training your men.

Just sayin."
"I have never talked to the feds and would not under any circumstances.

I publicly posted the information, linked already, when a fed recruiter came looking for me.

Have you talked to the feds? How is it possible that if guys who run meme sites - and preach constantly against violence - get approached by fed recruiters, you can call for violent revolution and not get approached by a fed recruiter?"
WAT TIME MATE
"So you are openly promoting terrorism on the public internet.

Have you been approached by the FBI and asked to become an informant?

If so, have you already posted the story about it online somewhere?"
"I don't know if they're feds, I have no way of knowing that. I know they are openly calling for terrorism against the government, have been linked to multiple deaths, and are currently using at least three different crucial web services that I'm banned from.

I also know that I was approached by an FBI informant recruiter and I wrote about it. I would assume that a group that is declaring itself a ""guerrilla warfare"" revolutionary group would have had members contacted by fed recruiters, and I am not aware of them posting anything about this.

I have no more information on them than that.

I don't have any control over any of this, and people will do what they want. But I have brought a whole lot of young people into this movement, and I have an obligation to say publicly that you are not going to overthrow the government and you shouldn't get involved with people who are telling you that."
"The FSB shut it down because the whole shit was infiltrated by US law enforcement.

You can check the responses to my posts just now. Everyone supporting this ""overthrow the government"" shit will simply call me names or claim I care about dead people.

This is the most obvious shit I have ever seen.

Get it together here, people."
"I am asking you to explain what you are doing, and why you are luring young people in to destroy their lives.

You are responding with name-calling.

If you are not a fed, and you have some kind of genuine plan to overthrow the government, then by all means, explain it.

Being super-duper edgy is not an argument."
"Look, dude.

There is an entire group of feds on the internet anonymously encouraging young kids to commit stupid acts of violence, and this is all out in the open. It is happening everywhere now.

If you can't see something this obvious, I don't know what to tell you.

I don't know anything about Bernstein, nor do I care about a dead Jew. I don't care about the dead slut parents either. The suggestion that the only reason I would be against random killings is that I personally care if people die is fucking stupider than shit.

We are currently being buried by feds. This is happening.

It has to be assumed it is happening, because it has always happened. And when you're looking around and seeing an entire group of people who just showed up and started encouraging teenagers to commit random acts of violence - who is kidding who here?

What is even the argument?"
"Great job, dude.

That really explains the plan to read Siege and overthrow the government.

u da man now dawg."
"Another brilliant explanation of how people from the internet are going to fight the US military.

Great job!"
"You need to think your strategy for a first time.

What are you actually even talking about?

I have explained an actual strategy of forcing public debate, which we are already on the brink of. That is an actionable plan.

""We'll get a bunch of guys from the internet to fight in the streets and then they will fight so good that they win"" is just baby fantasy.

It is insulting to me that I even have to write about this shit. But this whole thing is feds targeting confused young guys and it's like shooting fish in a barrel and it's disgusting."
"So you're saying you think you can fight the US military with a bunch of guys from the internet? Because the government doesn't have control of the military? 

Give us your shit, bro.

I still haven't heard it.

I've just been insulted for going along with ""just believe."""
"Everybody who's still somehow allowed on Twitter please go tell Christian Picciolini that  and I want to have him on The Krypto Report for the full show, and we won't hang up on him. "
"We are doing something.

This is working.

We have created an entire counter-culture and we are now talked about on TV all the time. Look at what they are doing to me - they have abandoned the entire concept of the internet to invent new forms of censorship against me.

Do you think this is because I'm having no impact at all?

We are on the verge of breaking through to the mainstream, forcing a situation where we have to be accepted as a valid part of the political conversation. When we are allowed in the discussion, we are going to win the public argument.

That is a goal. It is an achievable goal that we can all work toward.

Fighting a war against the US government is not a goal - it is a deranged, nonsensical fantasy created by COINTELPRO federal agents and LARPers in an internet echo chamber. It is absolutely fucking insane. There is no path, there is not even any explanation as to how or why this would be possible.

There are just a bunch of people on forums attacking anyone who questions the validity of this concept. All they do is call people names and suggest that they're not hardcore enough - even while most of them are anonymous internet posters."
"Are you calling me a "" bible-thumping manlet incel""?

The malet part is true, but here you all go: I presented an argument, I was met with a one-sentence insult post.

I can explain what popular support is - and I can explain that we are gaining it every day, I can give you data showing this.







I can also point to the fact that popular support for our agenda was widespread until the 1970s, and that the reason it doesn't exist on the same scale now is because people were tricked into allowing their children to be brainwashed by a Jewish-run indoctrination system disguised as an education system.

If you are literally arguing for an armed revolt against the government, then give us your shit, pal. Explain to us what that means and how it is possible. Explain to me how minecraft players from the internet are going to seal team six the US military and establish a new state.

Explain it or quit fucking telling kids this is possible.

Because you people are fucking predators. You are preying on young people who don't know any better with the stupidest fucking shit I've seen in my entire life.

Grow the fuck up."
"Framing the issue as ""the only reason any person would be against creating an echo chamber on the internet to promote the idea that people from the internet are going to somehow go to war with the US military and overthrow the government is because they are a pussy"" is the most dishonest bullshit I have ever seen in my life.

The immediate response to ""you can't launch a violent revolution because it is impossible to fight the military"" would in any normal universe be ""this person believe it is impossible for guys from the internet to fight the US military and beat it - let's explain to him how that is possible.""

Instead, it's ""this person is disagreeing with our assertion that people from the internet are going to READ SIEGE and overthrow the government - let's attack him as someone from an outgroup we have to destroy.""

This is a fucking cult. And it is being egged on by feds. They love this shit.

This is a circle jerk and it isn't serious. You people stuck in this need to take a step back and ask what exactly it is you are talking about, and how it is you think you are going to seal team six the government.

I don't give a shit about people dying. No one gives a shit about that. I care about winning, and people promoting this violence shit care about being super-duper double-dog edgy on the fucking internet.

Grow up."
"If you think a couple hundred READ SIEGE guys on webforums are going to launch a physical revolt against the government and then somehow successfully overthrow it, then you are delusional.

These people are creating an echo chamber where that somehow makes some kind of sense to them in their own brains, and I think this is a disaster waiting to happen. So far, there have been multiple deaths surrounding this particular subculture and none of them were even political.

So to answer your question: this entire discussion is so disconnected from basic reality, this is like asking: ""if gigantic lizards climbed out of the Hollow Earth and started tearing kikes limb from limb, would you denounce that?""

Obviously, I would not denounce that if it were to happen, but it is so far outside of the realm of possibility that even entertaining the question is personally degrading.

We have to gain state power. And the only way to do that is through mass popular support. There is no other logical possibility, short of something like an alien invasion. If people want to focus on nurturing a personal fantasy, I have no control over that, but I do have control over whether or not I endorse that."
Being openly in favour of destroying western society is an easy way to identify the Jew.     
"That's a different Eric Striker.

The one on Strike and Mike only talks about ""globalist"" and ""the illuminati elite."""
"""I HAVE NO IDEA WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WANT TO SHOVE JEWS INTO A GAS CHAMBER"""
"Bro I'm not in a position to deny anyone anything.

What I am saying here is that a bunch of spergs on the internet who aren't going to do shit are encouraging young/autistic guys to destroy their lives and it's fucking disgusting.

There is nothing weaker than encouraging other people to do shit you're afraid to do - and that is the only reason someone is going to post on the internet saying ""we need more violence."""
"Please note that people encouraging violence on the internet are encouraging other people to do violence. Obviously this is obvious, but it is worth pointing out.

The people who take it seriously tend to kill roommates and gf's parents.

Here's the thing: either we have made progress over the last 4 years or we haven't. If we have, then we need to analyze why, and figure out how to move forward with that.

Furthermore: either Dylann Roof's actions benefited us or did not. If they did not, then we need to take that into consideration.

I'm not going to disavow violent acts that have already been committed, because whatever. I don't think it is that big of a deal.

But understand that when you go on the internet and encourage people to engage in something that you yourself are obviously unwilling to do, you are preying on frustrated young men by encouraging them to destroy their lives in order to - in order to what? What is randomly shooting people supposed to do, other than bring in new laws and give people on the fence a reason to agree with the Jews about ""neo-Nazi white supremacy""?

What we need to do right now is very, very simple: we need to get to the point where we can publicly say what we believe without being silenced and fired from our jobs. We have a path to that. It is the path of creating media and media spectacle which sways young people to our side.

What path is supposedly presented by random shootings?

1. Shoot random niggers

2. Give the government pretext to shut us down further

3. Give Jews ammunition in their campaign to claim anyone who believes white peopel have a right to exist is a violent maniac

4. ????????

5. PROFIT!

This doesn't make sense and the people promoting it are not presenting any kind of explanation for what they are saying. They are simply saying: ""oh well, it will show them... it will teach a lesson... it will cause things to accelerate...""

The acceleration claim might be real: this could accelerate us into a situation where the government has an excuse to completely outlaw us as a terrorist gang.

Do you think that helps the situation? You really think that the more you are repressed and despised by the general public, the better off you are?

What sort of lazy, shit reasoning is this?"
"I understand the desire to shoot people.

But please: don't do it.

It doesn't help anything.

"Gods, it's like he's possessed by a Neocon.

The entire concept of neo-conservativism was using American blood and treasure for Jewish geopolitical purposes.

What is the relationship? That I'm talking about exercising global influence?

Was Alexander the Great a ""neocon,"" Jack? How about Julius Caesar? Charlemagne? Napoleon?

I guess so!

""Nationalism for everyone""—at least where ""nationalism"" really means race—is how this all was BEFORE Jews. So how is it a kike morality thing?

I don't know what that means. The white race had a series of empires, going back to Greece at the dawn of European civilization.

The last great empire was the British Empire, which was broken up after WWII when Jewish interests agitated for giving independence to globo-niggerdom because of kike morality.

I am not clear on what you are trying to communicate by claiming there were no empires. That is a baffling statement. It is noncontroversial that empires existed historically and noncontroversial that the entirely stable British Empire was purposefully deconstructed beginning in 1945 for ostensibly moral reasons pushed by radical Jews.

WHO didn't disarm their nukes? The fucking kike ZOG USA. China and Russia didn't want annihilation of the globe because they're not retarded Armageddonists. They only keep up their nuke arsenal because of the suicidal US.

I mean, you can Google MAD and the arguments for why the existence of nuclear weapons necessitates it.

China doesn't want to rule over the blacks. They want the resources. They don't even really want the land. They don't have a Manifest Destiny psychosis.

It's spitting in the faces of the heroes that conquered this continent to call Manifest Destiny ""psychosis."" Manifest Destiny is the idea that whites, being the master race, are given a duty by nature to rule.

Do you think we should give Texas and California to the Mexicans, because it would be morally good?

Why then should we keep any land at all, if it is our moral duty to help brown people?

What are we even talking about here? 

""The law of nature is power and anyone who voluntarily gives up power for moral abstracts deserves whatever the powerful decide to do to them.""

That is the most Jewish thing ever. Cold, heartless, cruel, vengeful. If you believe in Christ, you know this isn't what he wanted. If you believe in Odin, Zeus, Apollo, you know that isn't what they wanted either. 

Okay this is just baby womanly shit. And again, historically inaccurate. Christians conquered the world and Vikings slaughtered villages of men and raped their women. I'm sorry if that injures your kike vision of masochistic morals, but it is just what happened.

No one is talking about vengeance or cruelty. This is about reality and the order of nature itself.

And you feminine ones are the cruel ones anyway. If we don't rule the third world, all of these people are going to just starve to death and turn to cannibalism. We can regulate their nations for them, stop them from overbreeding, stop them from destroying the planet.

Our people are not cruel and power-mad. We want a return to simplicity of living. If we ever get a galactic empire, it will come through our intelligence, inventiveness, and perseverance. I don't believe the cosmos will give it to us if our attitude is to destroy our whole planet just to get off it. 

It's important he's putting this out there. We need to see where people want to take us before we just go along with it without thinking. 

Ask yourself: Why is power and dominance associated with cruelty if you are not brainwashed by kikes?"
"Slash and burn farming as practiced in Africa, South America and Southeast Asia actually leads to desertification due to erosion caused by the destruction of the root system.

It is only a short fertile period that results from slash and burn, which is why they have to keep expanding the incursion on the forests."
"Furthermore, power is a zero sum game.

That is something the kikes are actually honest about if you ask them.

And if you voluntarily give up power, it doesn't simply disappear into the ether. Someone else gets it. And they will use it against you.

The infrastructure is already in place for whites to establish a global empire. In fact, it already exists - we're just not the ones running it."
"THE ""EMPIRES ALWAYS COLLAPSE SO WE CAN'T HAVE AN EMPIRE"" MEME

Arguably, the Mongolian Empire existed as the Ottoman Empire until WWI, the British Empire was deconstructed purposefully for supposed moral reasons by giving independence to territories and the Chinese empire, which exists today, has existed for 4,000ish years.

The Roman Empire did split but it was reconstituted into East and West and then these parts were reconstituted as the Holy Roman Empire and the Russian Empire (and part of the Ottoman Empire), respectively.

So ""all previous empires have collapsed"" may be a true statement, but it is lazy af.

Besides being non-nuanced in terms of how that argument frames history itself and the ebb and flow of civilization, it also apparently implies that not being a part of an empire was somehow historically an option - when a Roman Legion rolls up on your forest clan, you just got empired. You're not given a choice.

Furthermore, the relevance of pre-industrial, pre-scientific history needs to be considered in context. The mechanics of the breaking up of empire were largely based on communications barriers between the central authority and the provinces. We have computers and airplanes now, donchaknow.

And I mean, you can go on and on. But I am just telling you straight up, it's a stupid meme that doesn't stand up to any form of scrutiny. It is just pounded into your head in school, so it is taken for granted.

And again: it doesn't even matter, because right now, refusing to engage in Empire-building simply makes you a vassal state of the Chinese empire."
"The idea that you are going to split the white world into powerless individual states which don't exert any power over any other state because of some inexplicable moral imperative while at the same time China is openly dominating the globe is so fucking stupid it makes me sick.

""Nationalism for everyone"" morality - which again, is obviously kike morality - only works if you mutually disarm with every other nation. Obviously. Obviously. Obviously.

Are you going to talk China into pulling out of Africa by convincing them it is morally wrong to oppress niggers?

Gtfo with that retard shit.

The goal is global white supremacy, followed by galactic empire.

Not some cuckservative moral fag shit.

The law of nature is power and anyone who voluntarily gives up power for moral abstracts deserves whatever the powerful decide to do to them.

You cannot use politics to change the fundamental laws of the universe."
"Great kid.

Comfort yourself by knowing that your own kids won't have to.

"u a big nibba. bc it was def imperialism that destroyed... the British empire... nothing to do with, you know, kikes.

We can just hope for the best as far the the African, South American and Southeast Asia programs to wipe out all ancient forests in their entirety. You know, maybe that doesn't matter, and it just won't have any effect at all on the places where we live.

The important thing is that we are nice to the niggers, after all. Because we have to have a moral imperative, based on the morality of Jews, or none of this will work. Fo sho."
"I'm going to write a long piece regarding the game theory involved in this program the kikes are running to silence me.

It is a blatant act of desperation. They are not gaming this out.

The fact that the media has been so directly involved in it, even while the media is so directly involved in the current war against Donald Trump and the general war on freedom of speech creates variables that they don't even appear to be processing.

The desperation is also clearly visible in their continued failure to form a valid narrative, even while major moves against censorship are being made in Washington.

Remember that right now, the official explanation for why I am being hunted across the internet is that I made an ostensibly deeply offensive joke about a dead fat woman 6 months ago.

Every time this is shut off, ammo is given to their own opposition. Trump's own people understand how dangerous it is to ban everyone right-wing from the internet. And the DS situation has already been directly cited in the net neutrality filing by the FCC.

It is not much of a leap to suppose that a move to investigate the media's own agenda to shut down ideas and facts which counter their own narrative would also cite the continued persecution of DS by the media.

"2/2

If you want to have Whites look at other cultures with proper sexual relationships between men and women as an argument for our own men taking back our own White women that's not something I'm opposed to. But it's a give and take. We have to be mature enough to deal with each other in an amicable way when it comes to discussing these things and that goes for everyone involved. Mocking our enemies is one thing. Mocking each other when points of disagreement come up within our own circles is a completely different thing. 

Look, bro. I get it. You're on the spectrum.

I get it.

I have nothing against you for that. Okay. It's fine.

But you need to just relax and not go nuts over stupid details of things which do not matter. Joking about banging gook women is not going to lead to some kind of purity collapse wherein all of the sudden everyone wants hapa mutant children.

I do think you can appeal to other culture's traditions without turning these appeals into a fetishization of those cultures and I think that's the fear among the more hardliners of us. The bottom line is any Pro-White movement is going to be actively subverted and we see this fetishization of Asians as a mechanism for non-Whites to enter into a Pro-White movement and then use this as a way to subvert traditional White sexual relationships between White men and Women. Which in turn can be used to subvert the arguments for racial segregation and racial purity standards. That's the fear and that's the bottom line. 

You are projecting a problem where there isn't one because you feel a need to perfect a thing which triggers an impulse.

You have created an entire complex fantasy situation around a few posts I've made. I get that some of you folks are fixated on sexual purity, and that the TRS memes and apparently also just my own analogies trigger you. Okay. You can fixate on that. That is your own business. But if you're going to be a part of a larger movement, you're going to have to accept that normal people are not as into obsessing over various sex-related theories as you are.

A lot of people have also spent more time around white women than you have, and so have a different perception of what they are. You claim not to be a princess-believer, but it clearly underlines everything you say.

And that's fine too. No problem. But you have to understand that normal people are not going to go along with that."
"Yes, yes. Good.

Hopefully we can discuss things rationally.

Although I think to be honest, bickering over trivialities is autistic and unhelpful. If we're all on-board with the idea that sluts are a disaster and the only thing men can fix is themselves, then the issue of whether or not we should go back and retroactively condemn long-dead men for giving women the vote doesn't seem to me a particularly important question.

But okay.

If you are willing to hear criticism then I am willing to give you the benefit of charity. That's just basic courtesy. The English word 'theory' derives from the ancient Greek theorein - 'to see'. In classical tradition the patriotic greek citizen who criticized his city was expected to be someone who had a profound understanding of the customs, traditions, and language of his own while being able to engage with foreign customs to see the best and worst in his own city. 

K.

From what I have gathered of your recent responses you're looking to other foreign customs as a role model or potential source of inspiration for what we in the West can do to restore White women and White society. That's fair. The fear is, however, that this seeing others is either a way to justify your own history of courting asian women or, more subtly, this seeing others will lead to a preference of (in this case) asian women over White women.

Bro, I'm not obligated or inclined to justify things to you. 

But whatever - there's a video of me hanging out at a mall with a gook skank a decade ago.

So maybe we should use an analogy about Moslems instead? Although I've banged one or twelve haji skanks, I don't think it matters to you folks who obsess over such things because there's no easily sharable video clip.

There's a video of you walking around an american mall in an asian country with a young (filipino?) woman by your side which is used to attack many of your 'pro-asian' viewpoints that you invoke as an example of how far white women have fallen. 

Yeah.

I lived in Asia for about half of my adult life, and that does influence my perceptions of Asian culture.

I'm not sure how much of my work you've read, but it's something I've written about in some detail.

I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and say we're all victims of our own time and we've all done things which would call our own actions and claims into doubt. I'm also willing to not attack you for your past given very few of us are saints. 

I posted an image from the TRS forums of a popular and degenerate poster there named Bill who posted something about the 'whiteopia'. Whether it was irony or serious doesn't matter. It was used to illustrate a point. Whether you post ironically about asians or gook-fucking sooner or later if you keep posting about it, then it becomes a norm - something not seen as taboo or explicitly undermining. Many of us fear that ironic posting about non-White women will rapidly open up avenues for serious posting about these things masked as ironyposting. 

Who are these ""many of us""? What group of people do you represent, and what exactly is your group's goal in obsessing over memes and sperging out in an attempt to force this puritanical consensus on what people should be allowed to talk about?

I don't have a direct line into your head, so yes, I disagreed your mocking of 

Mr. Bond does bantz. I think you are missing the bantz here.

I think you are over-reading this situation to an extent which is not at all healthy or normal."
"Just infinity strawman. Claiming the irony bro meme somehow applies here is an especially hardy try.

Then we get to the point: blame men.

I'm not fucking doing it.

You can.

Assuming this is somehow the fault of men, they are men who are now dead - and who had no idea what they were doing when they did it.

No man who has been born into this situation deserves to be shamed by you or anyone else for not being good enough to stop these whores from being fat, evil slobs.

Anyway, I'm done.

I want to mock you for your desire to defend indefensible whores, you want to attribute devious motives to me and invent arguments for me. Sure. Whatever. This would be fun in 2016, but right now the climate doesn't allow for this. Everyone is getting fidgety.

Everyone is on edge and this is not helping anything.

Women are out of control, everyone agrees, we also agree that the solution is for men to focus on the only thing they have any real control over, which is themselves."
"But just generally, we all need to relax and not press issues which cause conflict right now.

Generally, I believe that some degree of conflict is good, and trolling/pressing readers on triggering issues is beneficial. But everyone is kinda on edge right now - myself not entirely removed - so it is best to not do that.

I shall cease it.

For now..."
"For those not following the drama:

1. I was asked about the liberal argument regarding the fetishization of Asian women by right-wing men

2. I explained that it was not a fetishization, but simply an observation of the behavior of Asian women in contrast with that of white women - the former serving their men, the latter attempting to dominate their men

3. I explained that it did not matter in the larger scheme of things, as white men need white women to reproduce, it is simply a helpful thought experiment when considering what is going on with white women

4. I was mobbed by fedoras defending Trve Aryan Princesses. Instead of actually attempting to defend the indefensible behavior of western women, they are just claiming that I am advocating for producing hapa mutants with gookesses, while obviously being aware I am not promoting that (this is the sneaky way of the princess-defender who smears anyone who questions the honor of yon fair maidens)

5. I am not going to back off of this position - you can easily look at gook women and see how gender relations are intended to function, and this can be helpful in visualizing how our society would be working if we were not in a constant state of war with our women. It is plainly obvious that if it were not for the vital essence of young men being drained by vampire bitches, the rest of our problems would be easily solved.

I believe in saying the truth. Maybe this particular argument is not particularly helpful as it really seems to rustle the jimmies of WKs. But these are an easily rustled bunch. And all I have done is said the truth."
"The fact that you either actually think that is what I'm saying or think you can convince other that that is what I'm saying is white knighting.

I have obviously said the following:

Gook women are better behaved than the modern Western woman.

I view this as relevant, as it gives the individual looking at it the ability to compare and contrast what women are supposed to be - servants of men - with what our women are presently doing - attempting to dominate and subjugate men.

Anything that you are adding to that, you are adding to that.

For what?

Presumably, because your position that this somehow isn't an obvious fact is indefensible, thus you must accuse me of a totally different thing which you have invented.

Try instead to defend your own position:

""Western women are better behaved than gook women.""

Go ahead, Noble Sir.

Come up with an argument to support that claim.

Or just keep accusing me of saying shit that anyone can see I've not said. If that comforts you."

This is the definition of a sycophant.

His entire being is devoted to humiliating himself in order to attempt to gain favor from those who prize self-abasement.

Look at his blog on HuffPost. He is writing this for free, openly obsessing over me in a way that is so embarrassing that even I feel bad for the poor bastard. He knows that this is humiliating, and he knows that anyone paying attention to it can see how humiliating it is, and that is why he is doing it.

An entire book could be written about this man's psychology, and the way it applies to others who willingly choose to serve powerful people because they believe that some of that power will rub off on them. Along with obviously the way that weak men who have failed at life can develop a drive to destroy successful men as if it will justify their own existence.

"The NYT obviously isn't concerned about the accuracy of a narrative. But as narratives go, it is an interesting one. And given that the target audience is white women who are naturally obsessively jealous of the femininity of Asian women, I think it is a very strong means of moblizing white female hostility toward white men.

And there is at least a core truth there, on some level, but I don't personally believe it actually relates to Asian women so much as it relates to the idealized image of the female in the mind of masculine men. 

Obviously, masculinity and testosterone are directly correlated with right-wing politics, so it isn't really surprising that this would be a thing.

Men in general are disgusted by the behavior of white women, who act like deranged animals. And overweight and generally sloppy and repulsive. Conversely, Asian women are pleasing, feminine and fit.

So if we are interested in the truth (and obviously narrative-builders are not, but if were were), we would say that it isn't really about Asian women. It is about the difference between Asian women and white women.

Also of actual interest might be the fact that Asian women are literally the stereotype. The NYT article was written by an Asian female who was trying to claim that the stereotype isn't real, but that is about as legit as claiming that black criminality stereotypes are not real.

It would be interesting to ask from a scientific standpoint, in particular endocrinology, why it is that Asian women are superior to white women in every measurable category. I think it is clear that this is a hormonal issue, part of which is obviously genetic, but another part of which may relate to xenoestrogens in the Western environment, as well as - and this is key - the virtually mandatory birth control pills girls and women are fed.

And then of course there is the sociological aspect, and the fact that women in the West are taught from birth that they are just defective men instead of actual women."

"Shoutout to HATEHOUSE for saying nigger the most times in a podcast.



For a new show that's clearly low on prep, this show is abnormally good.

Fun team of persons."
"Yeah.

The Atlantic piece could have been well-written. Any competent journalist could have composed a narrative of what social factors would lead a liberal teenager to become a top Nazi exterminationist. Angela Nagle has formulated a very solid narrative about how men are deprived a normal life with wife and kids. With me personally, I can think of at least four different avenues he could have taken to build a narrative about my supposed ""transformation"" which would have been internally consistent and potentially compelling.

Any of it would have been a lie, and the actual story is much more interesting, but the goal of narrative-based Jewish journalism is obviously not to communicate nuanced or interesting concepts, let alone the truth. But I have a certain respect for journalists who are able to formulate manipulative fake narratives in order to push an agenda, because it can be something of an art. 

O'Brien is clearly intellectually incapable of even grasping the concept of ""narrative,"" which is why he produced this bizarre, serial killer-tier obsession diary.

But even if he had the minimal competence needed to formulate a narrative around the idea of ""liberal teenager niggerboy-kisser converts to Neo-Nazi,"" it is an unhelpful narrative for the agenda of his Jewish masters.

The reason being that me having been a liberal puts me in the place of the target audience, and then I have become a sympathetic character for them and they are then asked to consider the possibility that they or someone they know could also be put on this type of journey. That then naturally leads the reader to consider all different sorts of ideas which I don't think the Jews are trying to encourage them to consider.

What I would have done if I was formulating a narrative against me for Jews: I would play-up what he was talking about with me abusing my high school girlfriend, then try to make it out like I was raised in some conservative Christian household, and that it was a natural progression for me to become a right-wing exterminist. Then you could mix in the idea that all Trump supporters are only one step away from being Nazis, because being a Republican is just a degree of Nazism. Basically make it out like I am just a more honest version of a mainstream white Republican.

As far as me having lived in Asia: this would have been a perfect place to inject the narrative, recently featured in the New York Times, regarding the fetishization of Asian women by right-wing men.

That puts me as an ""other"" to the liberal readers, fully, and also fits into the anti-Trump hysteria, which is presumably the main reason for writing a cover story about me in the first place.

Obviously, Luke O'Brien is about as incompetent and pathetic of an individual you can find on the planet earth, but The Atlanic's editor Jeffrey Goldberg is not. So I was shocked that this piece came out as it did. The cringey 6th grader prose and the foregoing of a normal fact-checking process was mind-blowing, but the lack of an editorial decision to enforce a narrative of any kind was beyond the pale."
"The read more thing is fixed (don't lose my spot on the thread) and I can now type up full essays.

Good job, "
I cannot describe to you the joy I feel at this moment.
"It's all based off of that O'Brien Atlantic article, about half of which was just completely made-up. And it will come out that this guy just outright makes stuff up. He is losing his mind at this point, and is going over the edge. At some point, the Huffington Post is going to be forced to retract the things he's writing now, and I think the Atlantic will follow suit and issue some kind of a statement. 

As far as ""dreadlocked hippy vegan"" - yeah, I guess. the situation is that I dropped out of high school when I was 14. That wasn't reported in The Atlantic, either because Luke didn't find it out because he is a bad journalist, or because ""the only information I have on him is from before he turned 15"" and ""let me tell you about what this guy's political views were when he was 13"" made for a poor narrative.

Although he didn't really even have a narrative at all, and the whole article was just creepy insults because he is such a horrible writer, the narrative that he was vaguely going for was ""look at how this liberal young guy transformed into a Nazi..."" And in general, people don't look at what a 13-year-old does as something especially important to their adult character. So the implication is that I was 16 or 17 when this was going on.

Veganism: So in my freshman year of high school, I went to this ""alternative"" school that was really a circus. I had a girlfriend who was a vegan, and it was a pretty big trend with the cool kids at the school, so I did that for a little bit just because you know, whatever.

Dreadlocks: that story is that I had sort of longish hair and I purposefully made it nappy. I used to just rub my hand in a circle so it would get twisted up and stand on ends. There were actually ""dreadlocks"" because I have very straight hair.

I didn't actually remember this when it was printed - I think Columbus Alive printed it before Luke - and had to ask some relatives who explained it and I vaguely recalled.

The obvious implication being made - that I had somehow adopted rasta culture or whatever - is fake news. 

Hippyism: sort of I guess. I definitely did a lot of drugs in that 1.5 years I was in high school, which is pretty much why I dropped out.

I will see if a relative has any pictures I can post, as this seems to be something people are interested in. And it's kinda fun."

I've been trying to clarify a few of the issues you've brought up on the show Matt and I do now. Critiques are fine. Especially if we challenge each others positions and get better. That's honestly how we've all gotten as far as we have.
"No, I don't have any beef with Russian religion.

I just see a problem in promoting that as something needed in America. I don't think urging conversion to a foreign, alien religion is good strategy for what has to be a mass political movement.

the issue is that he let it out of the closet
"I endorse this statement.

And you know that there are certain types of wood paneling that can cure pedophilia."
"Yeah, that's fine. I'm just taking that from podcasts and blog posts and so on. Maybe I've misunderstood.

Again, I don't think a consensus is really possible, so it's just about keeping some kind of agreement of peacefulness."

This is now a crown molding thread.

No big deal imo."
"Because from my view, what it feels like is that I am being regularly criticized in a way that is not even making an effort to be polite, and then if I make a polite criticism, it is escalated into vicious personal attacks/slander.

But again, whatever the case, I'm not mad. I am mad at Jews."
"I think it's better for everyone if we find a way to differentiate between criticism/disagreement and attacks.

I personally don't think it's really that hard to see the difference, but maybe we need some kind of guidelines that we can all agree to as far as that goes."
"I have made no secret that I am opposed to:

-Communism

-Stahlhelms/Costumes

-""Destroy America""

-White knighting/feminism

-Russian religion

But even if those are irreconcilable differences, there is no reason for animosity here. That can all be figured out later. Right now, we need to focus on kikes."
"Bro, I was never mad. I like you guys.

I think you just have a guy on your team who is a bit sensitive. But it's cool, I'm not going into any sort of personality shit. I am committed to that. There is a difference between polite disagreements about issues and so on and vicious attacks.

There's no reason we can't all be friends."

Yeah there is def the question of what this guy did his entire life. Deciding to be a journalist in your forties is not a normal life path. I would suspect he was a junkie or maybe just a drunk. His face shows a history of substance abuse and the fraud is typical of that sort. 
"Yeah.

That was street activism combined with electoral politics. NSDAP was saying “put us in power and fix these problems.”

“Is it a good idea for the Alt-Right’s IRL manifestation to be marching through the streets in all black military garb with the KKK?”

Has been redirected to a complicated and nuanced ideological discussion, mixed in with purposeful misrepresantations.

Dishonest. Sad! "
"7/

We can have a long drawn out discussion about whether or not America is a Masonic conspiracy which must be crushed. Fine. 

Turning the Alt Right into 80s goon Nazism is not something we can have much debate over, which is presumably why parrot didn’t bother explaining the logic of it. "
"6/ 

Yes, I am against “destroying America,” but view that as too obscure and esoteric to directly address indivuals over. 

Marching a bunch of KKK members and “Neo Nazis” through the streets for no clear reason is not esoteric and it is immediate in nature. "

Whether or not we should destroy America and create a new fascist state and whether or not we should march through the streets in military fatigues, KKK logos and plastic stahlhelms are two separate questions. The only reason you would conflate them is to purpose obfuscate. "

"So the Shelbyville march is over and now it is time to move on. I don’t think beating a dead horse is a good idea. There was not much media coverage. We should learn a lesson is all, and I think most of us have. "
"As I wrote in the article, I work a lot writing a website that is read by millions of people a month.  

Clearly, a lot of time goes into putting these events together.

Marching through the streets being of prime importance is not an idea I subscribe to. I'm going to take a different approach."

"Boomers, if we criticize you, it's not to blame you.  Blaming others is transferring agency and deblitating.  The criticism is so we make sure we steer off onto a better course and don't repeat mistakes.  Unless you're in love with the state of things, you should be encouraging the critique."
"“Women are whores” is a statement that offends all women, while a blanket “men are fat slobs” would not offend men who are fit, as they understand it doesn’t apply.

Is this difference in response indicative of the fact all women are whores or just that women have a collective identity?"

I doubt that Boomer Prime  identifies as a hippie even with his ""all races are equal"" hippie Jew tripe. "
The short answers is: helping young people understand that their birthright was stolen from them and their ancestor intended for them to have so much more than they got is more important to me than tiptoeing around the infantile emotions of used-up hippies.
"Yeah exactly this.

When you get to be 60-something and your own children are disagreeing with you for the same reasons your parents did half a century ago, it’s got gotta time for a bit of self reflection.

...unless you’re a boomer, in which case it is still “please, don’t call me a racist” time"
"That’s the difference between you and me, boomer: I have absolutely zero desire to feel good about what a unique and special individual I am.

I simply want to pass on some some semblance of western civilization to the next generation. I know that concept is not “original” enough for you."
"And you people cannot even claim to support the Founders when you argue with us - we certainly know what they believed about race.

You can only claim that you know better. You’re smarter than Thomas Jefferson because you realized niggers are smart.

Truth is hard. So you believe lies. Feels good."
"The dangerous ideology is boomerism: the belief that you, as an individual, are smarter than everyone who ever lived before you.

With “race is BS,” you take a massive shit on the United States and the Founding Fathers - you know so much better. Because some kike told you niggers are equal."

I HAVEN’T SEEN BOOMING LIKE THAT SINCE LSD DRIVEN ORGIES IN THE MUD AT WOODSTOCK

These boomers who rush out to defend the collective are clearly defending themselves and their acts against our civilization, because it isn’t natural for age range to become a hive mind. "
"See, it actually is technically NABLT, it's just that the ones who aren't like that don't need the caveat. 

If you're a boomer and you feel the need to NAXALT when someone says something negative about boomers, it's because that applies to you. 

Fact: No statements about genx or m offend us. "
"Great blog. 

And that's a key point: the fact of this collective mind and need to _blame others_ whenever a generalized statement is made is very representative of why they are despised in the first place. 

&gt;SURELY NO PERSON WOULD CLAIM I DID SOMETHING WRONG"
"Bingo. 

That's the answer I was looking for. "
"I can't even begin to imagine being offended by a absolute negative statement about millennials. 

Only boomers feel this generational collective. 

Presumably, it is because the absolute statements about their generation do apply to them."
"Der Eternal Boomer is incapable of recognizing the wrongs of his generation, because, like women and Jews, he has a collective identity. 

If someone says ""millenials are fags,"" I'm just like ""lol yeah ikr"" - yet a boomer must rush to the defense of his generational kin.

"9/ Video games are overly time consuming. But I do read reviews of them. 

Last one I played was Fallout 4. I didn't finish it. The Sim City shit got to be too much. "
"8/ Novels I do not read anymore virtually ever, except old scifi and noir before bed. 

I read 50 Shades, one of the Harry Potters, Hunger Games, other popular young adult novels. And one of those horrible John Green ones a couple years ago. It made me wish I was dead. "
"7/ Comic books are mostly so badly kiked that I can't read them anymore, they also don't have really any cultural relevance at all, so I don't have much excuse to. I sometimes read old comics before I go to bed because I enjoy the medium. "
"6/ I watch GoT and TWD because they are cultural phenomenons, like Rick and Morty. I can also say they have a very high visual production value that can be genuinely entertaining, even while the content is kiked. 

Daredevil is actually good. Genuinely. The fighting is gook-tier. "
"5/ TV shows better. 

Better Call Saul is very good, and you can actually learn something about people from it if you're paying attention. This mother-son relationship with his girlfriend is very instructive, and it is clearly intended to say ""this is fuck"" not ""go do this."" 

He overcomes it. "
"4/ Movies are not good. Of those I remember that were, reverse chronology, would be Guardians of the Galaxy, Jurassic World and Dredd. 

Blade Runner better than any of those. 

"
"3/ There is still entertainment media that is not entirely kiked. None of it is actually our shit (except Blade Runner 2). But it isn't like consuming pornography. It isn't going to directly harm your soul. 

Except like, Saw and those shock horror films. That damages people. "
"2/ For people in general though, spending a couple hours a week with mindless entertainment is not going to somehow make them go suck Weinstein's cock or whatever.

This puritanical ""ANYONE WHO WATCHES A TV SHOW OR SPORT IS KIKED"" shit is a kind faggy baby attitude that I don't think helps anything."
"1/ Not sure if that's directed at me or just people in general. 

If it's directed at me then the answer would be that my entire task as a man is to subvert the dominant culture, and in order to do that, you have to know what it is. 

I do a lot of TV, music, Reddit, etc. along with news. "
"Honestly, I really don't know what I think of Rick and Morty season 3.

"He is an embodiment of Jewish nightmares.

"7/7 Examining ourselves on the neoteny spectrum is, as such, beneficial to an understanding of why gender relations have broken down to such an extreme degree among whites as to disable basic replacement reproduction activities."
"6/ Bringing us back to the initial Katy/Kyary neoteny comparison: you can offer decision-making privileges to Asian women (standard western-designed ""equal rights"" laws have been copied in Asia) with much lesser blowback due to a lesser intrinsic drive to rebel and assert dominance."
"5/ Specifically, the male acquiescence to female ""liberation"" has resulted in this current conundrum.

In order to solve the current conundrum, women must be de-liberated by having their decision-making privileges removed. "
"4/ Presumably, the behavior of the women currently is a response to stimuli, given that women naturally have little to no agency. 

It then follows that it is the treatment of women by men that is problematic to sexual relational normalcy. "
"3/ That having been said, obviously, every race successfully adapted, or it would not exist. 

Currently, the situation between white men and women is going to lead to an end of the existence of our race, due to a series of external factors (read: Jews). "
"2/ However, applying the concept of the neoteny spectrum to female behavior, with neotenic females having a behavior pattern universally preferable to males is in no way outrageous or ungrounded.

It appears to simply be self evident."
"1/ The fact that white people have lower average IQs than Asians yet a wider bell curve and clearly evident higher creativity levels remains unexplained, unfortunately (PC cockblocking of scientific research).

However, the neoteny spectrum still exists, with whites in between Africans and Asians. "
"I do not simply make things up.

Increased neoteny is directly correlated with higher IQ and higher IQ is generally correlated with lower physical strength.

No general assertion that I have made here conflicts with current scientific thought on this issue.

Controlled studies a problem because PC. "
"Asking for evidence of things that can be swiftly Googled is an internet game that people with ungood ideas enjoy.

Also included in this is semantics and the assertion that obvious generalizations are absolute statements.

It's basic sophistry designed to reinforce an individual's own wrong belief."
The only thing worse than a white knight is a white knight who blames women's behavior on Jews. 
"Do you have ""Google"" on your computing device? 

Neoteny as a driver of HBD is a core concept of modern racial science.

Neoteny exists on a spectrum from African Bushman to Japanese. "
"Forgive me, but you are asking for evidence that white women behave poorly? 

I must be confused. 

Would you also like evidence that it's dark at night or that snow is white? "
"""Interesting woman"" is an oxymoron. I'm talking about our men and the trappings of civilization we created.

But we evolved through sexual reproduction, and as such, selected female traits drove the development of our men. 

Pic related. Asia rn w/o white influence. Boring/stagnant meditation shit."
"We should be thankful that our women are the way that they are, otherwise we would have become the Asians, which, while civilized, do not really have very much going on that is especially interesting.

However, a condition of our evolutionary blessing is the curse of these women's intrinsic behavior"
"The Africans - what are commonly known as ""niggers"" - have an extreme situation where women effectively provide for themselves entirely, and simply use men for sex. 

Gigantic asses are a peramorphic trait and the modern western obsession with dat azz is a result of Jewish niggerization. "
"Neoteny, like all physiology, corresponds with psychology. Asians overbred for neotenous traits, creating physically weak forms.

White people did not do that. 

We have a situation here where white women have to be constantly under abusive conditions in order to maintain contentedness."

Mind your own goddamn business."

I just hope he fixes it soon."
"It's a hard position I'm in. I want to support  100%, but the reason I am such a supporter is because of his principles. Most of us feel this way, which was what Ram was trying to undermine by threatening him with the Feds for a totally legal *observation*

Gab is going down, little time to fix it"
"Well here it is Tuesday morning and I see that weev's account has not be reinstated.

"Because he isn't going to have a site to use to fundraise and now he's lost his free speech mandate by being tricked into censoring.

"This isn't drama. 

This is the fate of the entire platform. Which is now going to be lost, due to bullying by a random twitter personality, who threatened Gab with the FBI to get them to make a hasty, wrong decision - while they were under pressure already from the registrar. "
"In his tweet, he tagged the FBI. So this was a threat to sic law enforcement on Gab. 

And perhaps they acted hastily without thinking it through. And now they've got themselves in a situation where they can no longer claim to support protected speech. 

Why would you threaten people with the FBI?"
"Here he is saying he is ""aware"" of BvO. 

So, is he ""aware"" as in that he's heard of it? Or did he take the 2 minutes to read the Wikipedia page? 

If it is the latter, then he is lying on purpose to kill Gab. 

Why? "
"The question here then is: is this man lying, or can he not read Wikipedia? 

This does not require a &gt;95 IQ to understand. 

It couldn't be more straightforward. 

"
Here is weev's statement on the twitter personality (40k followers) who killed Gab. 
"Yes, you have to wonder why irrelevant people with no cultural influence would run around calling the people who are changing the world shills. 

I don't call people shills. But I do know that shills attack activists and try to sow dissent in the ranks. Their main purpose. 

People are also jealous."
"He's not really fucked with weev. 

Gab has a pretty limited reach for us. DS is much more popular. 

What he has done is fucked Gab. Because without the free speech high ground, they are going to have a very difficult time finding allies in the registrar fight. "
"Surely, random people on twitter can't simply dictate Gab's policy on freedom of speech. "
"That has not been confirmed, no. And I think it has in fact been confirmed to not be the case. The letter was published. I think it was simply ""hate speech."" 

But banning weev at the same time is a very strange coincidence. 

I still think perhaps there has been some mistake. "

"Not putting more on Gab, I'll write an essay, but bulletpoint:

-Ideology should remain exactly the same

"Those statements - as I said them, not as you edited them - are (I would hope obviously) congruent and complimentary.

"I do think people need to go easy on Vox, because he's clearly in the midst of a personal crisis. 

After this shit over the last couple of hours, I no longer think ""someone put him up to it"" is even likely at all.

Most normal Americans - the people we are trying to appeal to - identify with the American flag.

This is really convoluted and overthought. What other nationalist movement in any country does not use the national flag?

Hitler didn't because it was the Weimar flag. "
"Yeah watch the clips of Charlottesville and just imagine if all our guys had been decked out in American flags. 

People would have seen it and said: ""oh these must be the guys coming to rescue America.""

The Jew chants would have been viewed in that context too.

Instead it was confusing to people."
"OK, I grant the advantages of cooption of existing symbols, and of Mao's dictum, ""The guerrilla must move amongst the people as a fish swims in the sea.""

But the equally important function of symbology is to establish the identity and cohesiveness of the revolutionaries."

Successful national movements in Europe do 50/50 national flag and movement flag.

You're going to be saying the same things as Nazis no matter what. Or cucking."
"&gt;Look the same 

That's exactly the point, bro.

You want to look like what the people identify with by using their symbols, which gives you the ability to say whatever you want to say and have it heard.

I have no idea how this is confusing. To anyone. It's hard to believe, tbh. 

"
"Owning the ""Neo-Nazi White Supremacist"" insult and using Nazi memes while using Hitlerism as a guide and a starting point ideologically is not the same thing as dressing up in Nazi uniforms and marching around.

"I think they are in the process of trying to restore that.

"People against the American flag have been kiked. 

Unless they're southerners in which case they are just being stupidly stubborn and putting trivial grievances over victory.
