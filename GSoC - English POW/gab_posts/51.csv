3. I explained that it did not matter in the larger scheme of things, as white men need white women to reproduce, it is simply a helpful thought experiment when considering what is going on with white women

4. I was mobbed by fedoras defending Trve Aryan Princesses. Instead of actually attempting to defend the indefensible behavior of western women, they are just claiming that I am advocating for producing hapa mutants with gookesses, while obviously being aware I am not promoting that (this is the sneaky way of the princess-defender who smears anyone who questions the honor of yon fair maidens)

5. I am not going to back off of this position - you can easily look at gook women and see how gender relations are intended to function, and this can be helpful in visualizing how our society would be working if we were not in a constant state of war with our women. It is plainly obvious that if it were not for the vital essence of young men being drained by vampire bitches, the rest of our problems would be easily solved.

"If the Komnenoi dynasty maintained the strength it had before 1204, yes - it's quite possible that the Ottomans, originally a mere beylik, could have been squashed before they grew to any prominence.

I fail to see how this is unreasonable to you. Basic geopolitics."
Possibly. Hard to tell sometimes.

Sorry mate, but the Latin Empire fiasco had a big part in the destruction of Byzantium.

"I don't think you know about the event we're referencing. There has been more than one Crusade. And all of them had different goals and results.

I will say again that nature and morality are something that has to be enforced and is based on the collective interpretation of what is moral and natural.

Which is why we must be moral collectivists&amp;traditionalists."
Absolutely.
"Sure. I am talking about white leftists here primarily.

All white leftists are individualists.

Jews are by default collectivists subversives taking on the role of individualists."
"That may be so, but even if we accept that Jewish Communism (decisively proven as a failed ideology by now) is collectivist...

It is still the case that all leftist ideologies relevant in 2018 are decisively individualistic."
"You could argue that sure.

That communism is dead and gone though.

Let's be real here. We're not fighting communism in 2018.

I know a lot of our people like that talking point. But it really isn't our no.1 enemy right now.

Communism died in 1990 forever."

Common decency prevents good men in traditional societies from contemplating such autistic selfishness."

"One day. Maybe.

But you do see how you will have to stop importing white Europeans as well for that to happen? A certain amount of isolation is necessary for these things to grow.

"Well that is the debate really isn't it.

To me, all identity stems from blood. All that I have to fight for is what my fathers built for me and what I will leave to my sons.

The tribe is eternal. If I cease being a part of it, most of my identity is forfeit."
"Sure.

I'm just saying that from my perspective - the US can never go beyond cultural nationalism. Perhaps racist cultural nationalism. But that's about as far as it can go.

Any appeal to ethnic tradition is obsolete from the get go."
"Except by blood.

You are in a sense, an adopted son to a family that is not biologically your own."
"And that makes sense.

For someone with Anglo roots.

Not so much for someone who doesn't have them."
"Well let me put it this way.

I want to live in a country where the people of my blood are on the money.

Where churches are named after my saints. Where buildings are built by my ancestors. Where streets are named in the language of my grandfather. Not someone else's."
"And that's great. Your place is certainly there, where your ancestors toiled and bled.

But it is not the place for people like me, whose ancestors toiled and bled on the other side of the planet."
"Indeed. Many of my white American friends are setting up an evacuation plan. Buying property in their ancestral homelands (Greece, Poland, etc..) and getting ready to jump ship if something happens.

They have no loyalty to the US."
"Sure. I think the South might have more of that identity core to speak of.

But still, I wouldn't feel like a Southerner if I moved there. It's not my heritage."
"Case in point.

Most people see the US as a financial hub. Not a new identity.

They either retain their old one, or just become consumerist golem with no identity to speak of."
"Well what is worshiping the Founding Fathers but implicit ancestor worship?

All nations are built on the worship of great mythical heroes of its past.

Richard the Lionheart, Napoleon Bonaparte, Bismarck, Peter the Great, and so forth. To embrace another nations great heroes is to abandon your own."
"Well to each their own I suppose.

For me it just wouldn't work. I don't like the idea of worshiping someone else's ancestors."
"Possibly. But a country needs to form a core. One united by centuries of camaraderie and bloodshed.

A society that is importing all over the world, or even all over Europe...

Can it really do that? If I move to the US, I'll frankly have nothing to do with any of the previous history of it."
"But what is this adopted Anglo identity?

Muh Constitution and Gun Fetishism?

If a Serb can become American in that sense - why not a Korean? Neither of them have much of a connection with the Founding Fathers or any of that stuff."

We're going to have a society based on the free market and an all-powerful divine king that can interfere in this market at any time. But he won't.

Because...he knows better.

Ok."
Yes. Welcome to capitalism.
Now just to get a time machine.
"So now we're imagining a country where every king must be a libertarian also?

What???"
"And why is the government supporting them? Because the corporations are paying them to do so.

Trust me, in this case the chicken did come before the egg."
"I agree but that breaks the reasoning of capitalism that the state must not interfere with the free market. And in general that private corporations are more trustworthy than the state.

You can't be a monarchist libertarian. It's insane."
"Alright, I'll tell you what.

Find me a capitalist society that is not based on loans and interest, and I'll gladly move there."
"So we're counting on the monarch having a power but not using it because....reasons.

Look, you're defining an extremely odd version of capitalism right now.

I recommend trying to put it down on paper and define it for yourself. I'm rather confused by it, and it seems like you are as well."

"It's enough for one monopoly to be unbreakable and your proposed system falls apart like a house of cards.

"Please dude. Just stop.

"Dude...fine.

You still can't have a capitalist society without usury. Please tell me how this is not the case.

And if you accept that premise - Capitalism is anti-Christian."
"Ok. Let's say the politicians don't interfere at all.

How do you prevent a monopoly in a fully libertarian society?

This is a pipe dream. One that you're seeing debunked in real time right now. Big corporations hate nationalism. More than the state even."
"I'm a firm believer in the idea that a bit of violence is required for a healthy society.

Just so the elite never gets to feel too safe. Keep them on their toes."

If the corporate elite establishes a monopoly - and can buy off politicians to protect them. How the fuck are you supposed to replace them?

Capitalism rests solidly on the concept of usury.

"Uhm no. Slav comes from the Slavic word: ""Slava"" = Glory. Potentially from the word ""sloviti"" which means ""to speak correctly"".

You're uninformed my friend.

Whether the Westerners derived the word slave from that is not really relevant to me."
"So we will have capitalism without banks or loans? Or interest?

Uhm...what? That's like being a communist that is against wealth redistribution."
Agreed. By frequent hangings imo.
"And why were Christians not allowed to charge interest on loans?

&gt;reminder you claim to be Christian :)"
"So let me get this straight.

The state can be bought off by the corporate elite. Let's not trust the state.

so....let's trust the corporate elite."
That's exactly the kind of person that capitalism selects for. If the main source of power is how well you handle shekels - that society is guaranteed to spawn a whole bunch of wretched creatures that will inevitably institute a plutocracy.

"If Palestine, and the entire Islamic world, believes Al-Quds is their capital. And Al-Quds happens to also be Jerusalem, saying it is a Jewish exclusive...well it might rustle some feathers.

And America gains nothing from it. Except a few terror attacks perhaps."
They're sending murderers. They're sending rapists. They have a lot of problems.
"Protecting Israel = Interfering

Just close your eyes and let the Middle Easterns settle their politics for good. Whoever comes out on top you can work with."

"Christ was the son of God you heretical prick. He had no ethnicity.

You're about as Christian as Jared Kushner."
"What's easier to do as an American politician?

1) Trashtalk America
2) Trashtalk Israel

It's quite clear who is the master and who is the puppet in that relationship."
"Dude...please..stop reading Zionist propaganda. Unless you're a boomer, this sort of brainwashing is inexcusable for a thinking man."
"And why do Jews control Jerusalem? Wouldn't have anything to do with extraordinary American backing?

Can we please get a few billion from American tax dollars every year as well?

The fact is that Israel has an insane amount of power in the world and especially in the US. Gotta recognize that."
"Ok. Prishtina is now the capital of Serbia.

Move your embassy there. Thanks.

No? Oh...almost like that rule applies only to a specific tribe."
"Ever considered that Palestine might have a good reason to hate the US?

Like the fact you helped the Jews take their country over the past 60 years?

Hatred does not come out of nothing. Albanian Muslims love the US.

Mull these things over a bit more."
Good riddance.
"Yeah...it's terrible being Jewish in the US.

Especially if you're a liberal Jew.

I mean it's like another Shoah really."
"See this?

This would make him a great president.

That shabbos goy bullshit does not."
"Expose the unjust. Speak truth never bow
Question everything."
"The only way to condition women not to do that is by killing those that betray the tribe.

In medieval times Serbian women f.e. killed themselves rather than being raped by Turks. Because they knew they were dead anyway as soon as the Turk left. At least that way they die with honor."
"Jew worshiping ''Christian zionists'' are scum of the Earth.

Being spat at remains part of life for Christians in Jerusalem

"You don't get elected to a US office without kissing up to Jews.

Empirically does not happen."

But yeah, the guy is legit."

"Seems like Mossad is out in force tonight on social media.

That's alright. Guess they can shoot kids some other day."
Shoo Shlomo. Work on your chameleon skills. Not impressed.
"I know.

I am responding to people who are so far up their ass that they think a Serb doesn't know what Islam is.

We've been butchering them and they us 500 years before the US was founded."
"I would agree. But do you for a moment think Trump will not send every American boy to die to protect Israel if such a war starts?

Cause let me tell you - he will.

He gave them his daughter. Why not your son?"
"I love how ignorant American boomers try to lecture me on the dangers of Islam - when they supported bombing my country over defending ourselves from them.

Very nice."
"It's critique of capitalism and the bourgeoisie mindset.

I always felt a great disgust towards what you might call Hollywood culture. And since right wing nationalism is taboo, I had to turn to the left-wing rebel thought.

I drifted away from it by visiting the West and seeing what absolute degenerates Antifa and their ilk were.

And then reading new books."

"They don't recognize Kosovo because of Palestine. I find Palestine not recognizing it a lot more impressive - as they would have good reason to do so.

I don't trust them because of their nature. In all societies, including this one - they are always part of the rotten globalist bourgeoisie merchant class that I see destroying the world."
"Most GOP voters will read a headline like this and say ""well still better than the DemocRATS"" and just vote GOP again.

And then wonder why they're not getting anything.

"Ann Coulter has got more balls on her than 99% of the ""alt right"". Not to mention she also publicly defended James Fields.

Fuck your ""optics""."
"Because not having them challenges the idea that men and women are equal in all fields.

And that's mean."

Blood is above politics/economics. That's Nationalism 101.
"I am not saying that you should admire Bolshevism as an ideology, far from it.

I am saying that there were great heroic deeds done by people that lived in the Soviet Union.

I'm a fervent anti-communist, but that does not mean that I hate my communist grandfather.

It might be a hard idea to grasp if you are raised with the notion of ""proposition nations""."
"Agreed on the point that we share nothing in common.

Nationalism is incompatible with liberalistic individualism of the kind that you and Antifa worship."
"Homosexuality is a sin.

That's not even up for debate. People who are afraid to say such a basic tenet of Christianity are unworthy of their faith."
That's nonsense and you know it faggot.
"Seems simple, which family would you rather share the holidays with? L or R?

Which side looks the alien? The foreigner? L'etranger?"
"The easiest way to enslave someone, is giving them everything that they want, while allowing them none of what they need."
"That's fair, a lot of them were exorcised or converted back in 2016/2017, but it was true once."
"I don't think so - Hillary is power hungry, not an ideologue. She would do what her donors ask her to do. Not poking a hornet nest is included in that."
You strike me a libertarian - so you're the exact target audience that wouldn't understand the post :)
"Ironybroism is the intellectual equivalent of an animal with rabies.

They're broken, dying and dangerous to themselves and society."
Great post.
"Things might change. At the present it's undeniably true.

I'll quote this and admit I'm wrong when it happens."
"Dude if you think that army is being formed to fight in Afghanistan - you're genuinely insane.

The US can say what they want - it's clear they're happy about such an army being formed and that their politics in the Balkans are still very much pro-Muslim and anti-Serb."
"Oof he tweeted once about it.

Talk about being happy with scraps.

He's so pro-white he never mentioned his white supporters ever, nor DID anything to help stop their replacement.

Keep living in 2016 if you want. Some people prefer hard truths than cowardly lies."
That's obvious. As soon as they receive full recognition - they're uniting 100%.
"Misinformation?

 

Dude what? The US is openly supporting it."
"That you are sacrificing billions of dollars and your sons to protect them.

But that's your call. I know how much evangelicals like to get fucked by Judaism. So knock yourself out."
"America is a client-state of Israel.

No country I know of has such a blind loyalty to Zionism. Left or right, Jews are venerated as Gods."
"Oh I know. Currently living in the former tribal lands of the Scordisci. Originally from the Tribalii tribal lands.

In fact I read somewhere that South Slavs have a surprising amount of Celtic blood."

"Those shekels came from dumb goyim that donated to his fake news.

And you're happy Lauren took that kike bribe?

Disgusting."
"I know Brittany semi-personally.

My comments do not extend to her. She is seemingly following through on her beliefs.

Of course I might be proven wrong lol, but in any case - she isn't trying to police us. So she is definitely off the hook."
"I already told you. It's not about the money.

It's about status.

If you really want to talk money though, Lauren Southern took hush money (God knows how much that was) from Ezra Levant and hid the disgusting stuff he pulled. How about that?"
"Hahahaha. Sorry dude, this must be some kind of low effort troll or something.

""Idk if there are beta orbiters on the Internet. Who can tell?""

Get out of here lol."
"Hehe, fair enough."
"That's what my father told me.

Never go into debt. No matter the scenario."
Of course. Brothers above all else.
"Your job as an honorable man is to defend honorable women in your life.

Not to donate shekels and go on social media tirades when someone insults a thot that doesn't even know you exist.

Don't be pathetic."
"If she wants to fly planes under enemy fire - great for her.

If she wants to make boring youtube content for shekels and fame - not so much."
"Yeah...I'm sure Lauren Southern will be starving soon.

It's not about money only. It's about status.

Imagine having 300k females compliment you and worship you on a daily basis.
Of course that doesn't happen because we live in a matriarchal society."
"He didn't say all money ever donated to Youtube is donated by beta males to thots.

You have a weird conception of logic."
"What he is preaching as the answer may not be healthy, but his analysis of modern female nature and social dynamics is correct. None can honestly dispute that."
"It cuts through bullshit like a knife through butter.

I respect that, even if his other advice is dubious."
"Yes. He's being honest with the men he is advising there.

His target audience are not women. Obviously."
"They're not, as far as I'm informed - providing a solution to this fucked up world. Just making the best for themselves of a shitty situation.

Again, I like the guy. He's on point. I merely disagree with his proposed solution, or lack thereof."
"I agree with your twitter post.

As for the Gab here - policies are not made based on exceptions. We are not calling for the heads of all women. Just the duplicitious ones."
"I find RooshV and the pickup crowd to be borderline degenerate and likely counterproductive.
HOWEVER.

They are honest. And they are correct in their analysis of gender relations.

"
It's like I said. Emily Youcis is one of the few alt-right females I don't want to strangle. I guess partly because she's not camwhoring for shekels and actually relying on her talent.
"Sure. But we are establishing some very important premises.

You don't have the right to call yourself a traditionalist and at the same time fight against traditional gender roles f.e.

Merely banishing the hypocrisy."
"People seriously need to stop using phrases like ""idc about x, I care about winning"".

It's not 2016, and you're not Bill Mitchell."
"There would be cases of individuals suffering misfortune due to marrying a bad spouse. And that sucks.

But it's worth it if it means that we have stable families. And stable families are very hard to achieve without ultimate patriarchal authority."
"It's a semantic misunderstanding.

I meant: ""It is socially acceptable for a woman to be a coward, not so for a man""."
"What? It's not an example. It's a moral ruling, based on biology.

A man that acts like a coward is a despicable being that should be mocked.

A woman that acts like a coward is not as judged, as it is expected for her gender to show less testosterone and bravery."
"The funny part is that the American public will be shocked and outraged when they hear ""Death to America"" in Teheran over this.

Well no shit dumbasses, you're stealing their shit and giving it to ZOG.

Which is not to say I'm a Muslim lol, but we can't pretend they have no cause to hate."
"If a woman speaks to God and saves Orleans - she can be on the front lines.

Otherwise, I would urge against it."
"I love how AltLite people don't even try to verify whether what they're saying is true.

Like seriously, are you people not aware that you're a bunch of retards?"
"Well first of all - we are not Arabs. And we're not Africans.

We would act a lot differently in those roles.

Secondly, the very fact that there is a risk of your daughter marrying a psycho that will kill her - will force you and her to think a lot harder about what kind of man she marries."
Caveman Nationalism = Best Nationalism
Well that's your call. Seems like a good idea to me. It only extends for as long as they are under your roof.
"Yep, watched it. Weev has his flaws, but he is on point here. Very much so."
"I am not well informed on the Pre-Christian Nordics, but I would challenge the Roman part. The ideal of a pater familias is absolutely what we need."
"Haha right. I was talking merely chronologically.

And thanks."
"Depends. In Victorian times - we were still honor killing in E. Europe xd

The roots of the rot were definitely appearing in the West though by that time."
Agreed.
"0 votes for 1st or 2nd wave feminism.

Now, I would ask people to actually consider the position of women in Victorian and pre-Victorian times. Also look up the term ""coverture"".

Then come back and talk to me about the position women should have in the AltRight."
"Lasted 12 years, you need a longer sample than that."
"That's your call, but she is a role model for women, whether you like it or not.

If she is allowed something, every female subscriber of hers will expect the same treatment for herself."
Hehe apologies. Mudgate does sound better.
"Let's clear something up here.

What does being a traditionalist mean?

Wanting to return to the moral norms of:"
"Exactly. Anons should always support real, genuine leaders that have our collective interest at heart.

Those who try to police us for their own interests - have to be shunned and discarded. Whether they be civic cucks, tradthots or merchants."
"And if anyone is confused - yes, there are different rules for males and females. What's allowed for men is not necessarily allowed for women. And vice versa.

For example, a woman can be a coward, a man cannot.

If you can't see that, I can't help you. You're a first wave feminist anyway."
"Nah, not at all what I'm talking about.

In terms of ideological debate right now - the e-celeb leaders of the movement are representatives of their base.

If Lauren Southern can be a mudshark and still be venerated by a bunch of beta orbiters - that will mean any woman can be forgiven."
"Here is the problem with this whole #SouthernGate thing

You are trying to sell young men that they need to get fit, get strong, go to war, possibly die, against great odds and much danger......

...so they can one day get a used up former mudshark in her 30s that will be equal to them.

Yeah...no."
"If you die and go to heaven - don't forget to ask your ancestors why they were such evil misogynists that mistreated their women and prevented them from being liberated whores.

"Pretty good. Wrapping up college this year. Will be travelling around in the summer. Can't complain.

How have you been?"
"To break the programming you have to be judgemental btw. Women respond to public shaming as an incentive better than to being nice.
If you can do it and be forgiven - far more likely you'll do it again. And others will see your example to boot."
"Idk about the States - maybe you have to be tolerant about it due to frequency...
But for me and my people, no. That's a red line. Coalburning puts you off the map.

And if you're not even sorry? Not even a chance."
"It's a complex topic. The OP was about this recent controversy with female thotleaders (pun intended).

If you're talking about it on a more general scale. Yeah sure."
"I'll admit - I never looked into that before.

I tend not to follow gossip in our circles as accusations fly left and right.

But yeah, she had a weird look that was hard to pinpoint at the time."
"Trad women yes. I have nothing but respect for them.

But a trad woman does not try to police men. And most certainly does not mudshark."
"Some of it is just paranoia. And best ignored. Mudsharking is a different thing.

But hey, if we get to a place where people like you or me are hanged for being too moderate...

I'll call that a win."
No vodka. I disavow.

"She was a good spreader of ideas - but she was never a good forger of ideas.

It is contrary to human nature."
"It's sarcastic mockery.

TradThot - a thot pretending to be trad."

"Ok so only racists that are aware they are wrong are actually evil?

That makes sense."
"I get your thought pattern. It's the mainstream idea of the world progressing to ever greater heights. I believed that too.

I now prefer the cyclical view of history. We do not eternally progress. Only our tech does. Our souls do not."
"So your ancestors did what they did because they weren't as enlightened and informed as us?

Must be why we're fucking awesome people today and our society is just exploding with genius and strength.

Reality check: No. We're degenerate retards on average. Unworthy of our ancestry."
"So you operate under the assumption that you are a better person than your parents and they were just dumb racist bigots?

Does being ignorant make racism and misogyny ok? Sounds like it from that description."
"You AltLiters better go to your fucking knees and beg for forgiveness from ZOG.

If you follow your own convictions to their logical conclusion. Your ancestors were terrible people based on what you believe."
"If, as a white person, you believe in gender equality, anti-racism and love Jews - you have no ancestors to be proud of.

None. You must be ashamed of all of them.

"They are whores when they fuck a guy without intending to marry him. You can be a whore with kids too.

Is this brand new information to you or something?"
"No. That's the topic of the day yes, but it is meant for all women in the movement.

We must not tolerate thottery in our ranks.

Childless whores have nothing to say worth hearing."
"And not like we didn't change our views.

However, as long as Christianity is framed in a traditionalistic, intolerant society - they are not an issue.

This was how Christianity was handled for most of European history. Before modernity that is."
Sure. I get your point about Pagans not spreading religion through war. The native European religions were indeed very ethno-nationalistic like that.
"Not at all.

As long as we each keep our own counsel in religious matters, I don't think we should pick bones over this.

If you're willing to fight alongside Christians, I don't see why we should not fight alongside Pagans."

"That in Islam it is a lot more reliant on the holy texts and their interpretation?

Yes. This is true.

Doesn't it? I believe it says quite a lot.
"But yeah, sure - I'll agree with that point, when defined as such.

However I fail to see the significance of such a tiny distinction. The original claim, if I recall correctly, was that Islam is a changeable religion?

Isn't this the stark opposite point we're agreeing on now?"
"Well the natural order of things and the natural impulses of man - are all derived from God. This is the position of both faiths. I guess the perceived difference is that there is a direct mandate to make your own laws in Christianity, while there isn't one such direct mandate in Islam?"
"This happens when you don't treat sluts like dirt.

"In addition it might be worth looking into the Shia and Sunni views on this topic.

They do seem to differ, what with the Imamah doctrine and other theological disputes. Not an expert on the topic, but I believe there are parallels to be drawn."
"Indeed. So your original argument then is that the key difference between Islam and Christianity is that the former does not employ reasoning, but only explicit revelation?

If so, I must say that similar concepts exist in Islamic dogma as well. Namely the 'qiyas' and 'aql disciplines."
"Very well. Define it for me please.

The way I understand natural law is that it is derived from God.

What you're saying is: ""these people are my enemies, let me dig for a vague theological reason that makes them stupid/evil"".

No reason for that mate. They're our enemies. That's all you need to know."
"I'm sorry, but you must have been raised in some weird New Age Christian community if you think Christianity makes provisions for a ""natural order"" that isn't directly descended from God.

"Yes. So did the Christian God.

Did you like not read the Bible? Seriously."
That's the ideal scenario. Unfortunately it would mean a lot of innocents (our non-degenerate people) dying in the crossfire.
"Not at all. It is based on the holy writings of the faith.

Aye. Christianity in Europe took on Pagan features.

Which hey, I'm not necessarily a fan of, but it was to be expected from the type of religion Christianity is."
Indeed. There was surprisingly high number of Greeks in the Levant at the time.
"Some of them sure.

It very quickly became a white religion though. It picked up far faster in Europe than it did in Palestine.

You can make the argument that Christianity had roots in Palestine. Of course. And that the first Christians were Jews. Sure.

But that's about it."
"Not the Seljuks either...

Try again.

Yes, Islam enslaved Christians for a long time before the Crusades were launched. Is it possible the Christians were merely not strong enough to fight back at the time?
My own people waited 400 years before revolting against the Turks. Were we Jewish?"
"The Abassids (not Abysads) were not controlling Israel when the First Crusade was launched.

You have some spotty knowledge on the time period, no offense."
"The Crusades as any war had multiple causes. I don't think Jews had much to do with it at all.
In Medieval times Jews had very little power. As you well know they were banned from most offices and generally despised by the native populations."
"I'm sorry man, I don't see where you're getting that conclusion.

1. Christians in the former Byzantine Empire were probably quite white at the time.
2. The First Crusade freed most of Anatolia and handed it back to the Greeks.
3. Christians were fighting Islam in Spain and France as well."

If historians are to be believed the streets ran red with blood. The Crusaders didn't make any difference between Muslims and Jews."
"It would be my 3rd choice. Ever since I visited the museums in Italy and Spain, I could really see the appeal."
"Btw, you should check out what the Christians did to the local Jewish population when they conquered Jerusalem."

The first crusade targeted Jerusalem because it's considered the holiest Christian city. Don't forget Palestine was majority Christian when the Muslims conquered it as well."

"Pushing the Overton window is exactly my goal.

If you have the guts to call for white sharia, I fail to see why you would be afraid of saying you're a racist.

I might be missing something about Western optics though, so do excuse me if I am."
"Right.

I like your analysis best of the answers I've gotten so far.

It's the most intellectually honest."
"But 2) must follow from 1)

I mean cmon people, are we supposed to just recognize races are different - but not act on it, ever?

This is intellectual abstraction I can't even imagine."
"That's exactly the point I'm making with people.

It is racism, and no it's not always bad."
"Sure, but you have to acknowledge most normies currently view racial theories as irrational.

So they will consider you racist, whether you like it or not."
"Trap?

I'm merely pointing out the facts as they present them to me.

It's not my problem if they're afraid of acknowledging their beliefs."
"What's the point of reporting facts if you don't act on them?

Seems rather silly to me."
"Why would you not avoid an individual if you know it's a lot more likely he is a criminal?
You might hurt his feelings?"
"Agreed. And for PR reasons it might make sense to deny being racist.

But just between ourselves, if we're being intellectually honest - this is what we are, aren't we?"
"Right.

So denying someone entry to your society based on their race (them being inferior or undesirable in some way) is racism is it not?"
"Of what - race?

The mainstream opinion is that it doesn't matter.

If you tell people it does, in their eyes you'll be a racist. Rightly or wrongly."
"Sure I get that definition.

The issue is that the people you are talking to view claims of racial differences as irrational.

If you make ""being rational"" the distinction between facts and racism, those who disagree with your facts will think you racist all the same."
"I don't know anyone who is consciously racist then. So sure we agree
I think the mainstream definition doesn't make that distinction as it views racial differences as completely social and not biological.

Not sure if we can sell ""we're not racist, we just think nonwhites are different"" to a normie."
"Again - define racism for me people.

I might agree or disagree with you based on that."
"How is it not racist?

Or is racism defined differently than I thought?"

3. Democrats expanding their midterm lead by a large margin long after the midterms are over (election stealing) while the GOP snores.

4. A promised executive order on birthright that was nothing more than a midterm political stunt.

5. Prison reform. BTW this is not a shock, the GOP congress and Trump himself made it clear that he wanted this to happen after the midterms. Some of these guys act like its the first time they heard about it.

"Here is the hilarious thing about Trump's SCOTUS picks. We are told that even though Trump is a failed president, at least he picked good justices for the Supreme Court. OK. Lets test it.

Trump floated the idea of an Executive Order eliminating birthright citizenship. That EO would end up in the Supreme Court, where we supposedly have these good conservative justices, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Gorsuch has already proven unreliable because he refuses to remove criminal illegal aliens. So you know that he won't vote for Trump's EO. And Kavanaugh is a neoconservative. We can only extrapolate from the way other neocon's think about the issue, but its reasonable to guess that Kavanaugh would vote against Trump's EO.

Is it possible then that Trump didn't sign the EO because he knows that it would be shot down in the SCOTUS? I think that is very likely. So we didn't even get the good Supreme Court justices. We got nothing."

"The Alt Right needs to move away from infiltrating the GOP and instead towards openly steering it. The thing to understand is that the GOP is well aware of the White demographic that keeps them afloat, they aren't ignorant of this, no politician would be.

They have up to this point rightly concluded that if they dog whistle during the campaign season they can garner that White support that they need to stay alive, while not actually doing anything to rock the boat after they are elected.

The only way to steer the GOP is to punish them in the next election cycle by not voting 2020 Trump, while simultaneously presenting to them these hard numbers where voting patterns are concerned as well.

We need to say that if the GOP refuses to become the explicit White peoples party that they will not exist in 20 years because it's just the plain simple truth.

Now many will say that it's possible and even likely that the GOP would rather fall on a sword instead of making the logical conclusion and adopting the White Identitarian position.

I cannot really argue against that, but in actuality it doesn't matter, if the party refuses to make that crucial change explicitly then it is destroyed and we still gain from it, simply by not having our people distracted by their silly dog whistles in the future.

All of the talk of ""ceding political power"" is foolish, because we don't have any political power, what people really mean when they tout this canard is that we get more time if the GOP stays in power.

The problem however, is that by 2031 the GOP will no longer be able to reliably capture political power, because it's White base will have eroded to the point of political irrelevance.

We need to begin building our own political alternative to the GOP now so that if they refuse to adopt our positions the increasing number of racially aware Whites will have somewhere to turn.

It must be remembered that a political party need not be in power to be effective, what it gives us is a moral high ground which is necessary when carrying out revolutionary action if it comes to that."

The media should always side with the state agenda because journalists are scum parasites that need to be shot and the only way they're useful is if they're controlled by the state. But ideally that state should be fascist/nativist with the people's best interests in mind.

"Aye. The first few years sucked, it was the same in the Eastern European satellites. The commies did a lot of purging."

Are you fighting for all whites everywhere? Primarily those who live in the US? Regardless of when they arrived there?
It's a very arbitrary ethnicity to claim nowadays."
"Huh? How does that relate to my question?
A free market is not an identity."
It's not that hard - they're usually stuffing fruit up their ass and/or blowing minorities.
"I agree with that - but is that really something you can build an identity on?

If yes - they're kind of unpatriotic sellouts.
If not - they're kind of disloyal citizens and foreign agents.

"But what are the traits of this pan-European culture? You don't have a common religion, history, role models, traditional music, etc...
The only thing all American whites seem to have in common is consumerism.

Or am I missing something?"
Hehe well I won't counter signal that. The Anglo elites are indistinguishable from (((their elites))).
Alright so the US should be a purely Anglo nation then? A lot of people are unclear on this. If you're an American white - you have to adopt an Anglo identity or?
"Indeed. It is my view of the situation that white Americans (with some minor exceptions such as the Dixie rednecks) don't really have a solid identity. Too much mixing and too much consumerism.
No offense of course, but if you can't define your culture, I don't think it exists."
"But again, you can't define yourself by an identity that keeps changing over time.
I can't stop being a Serb if I become a communist, or a national socialist, or a liberal or a libertarian. My ethnicity is not for me to pick.
For the American ""principle-identity"" this is theoretically not the case."
"I agree, in that I think people are hoping to raise an army to fix a problem that requires internal fixes, not external.

The only solution is to give the three Europes space to become themselves, and to unite on the idea of excluding all Other."
Quite true. And I would like American Slavs to return as well. They have no business leeching off of countries they had no part in building.
"I think that ideology comes from people who want as broad a tent as possible. Perhaps the fact E. Europe is dealing with diversity (or lack thereof) better makes them think having us on their side would improve their chances of surviving?
I don't know. But I do know it won't work in practice."
"See - this is honesty. And I respect you for it.

My people have next to nothing to do with the US historically.

Apart from Kosciusko and Tesla, little else comes to mind that binds us. And while I agree we need to work together in some respects, to insist that we are one and the same is insane."
"So if you stop caring about the Constitution - you stop being American?

Sounds more like a club than a nation tbh."
"Sure. I am all for ""no more brother wars"" and all that. Just saying - I would not have my kin die to be second class citizens. We've often been used as fodder and meat-shields, with little recompense.
So I must say I would rather see my Slavic brethren return to their homelands than die abroad."

"It's a hypothetical afterthought, but an important one.

If you ask non-WASPs to fight RAHOWA alongside Westerners, they should know what they're fighting for. Segregation? Mixing? Identity-loss?
 Deportation?"
"Sure, and hey this isn't top priority policies I'm discussing. Just trying to understand what comes after and honestly what the American mindset is on the matter. If you're 1/16th everything and you want to maintain all parts of your identity - it seems impossible to me.
You'll have to embrace one."
"I understand that, but my question remains - will non WASPs have to abandon their former European heritage and embrace the new Anglo-Dutch one, or will they all maintain their original folklore until it's bred out of them and they all mix into a European stew of everything and nothing?"
"See that makes some sense, but it's still dubious. Are the Spanish included? The Italians? The Irish?
Does that mean Slavs and Southern Europeans need to be deported as well (not opposed to this idea necessarily)?
It's something the American AltRight refuses to address most of the time."
"Well that's exactly my point. The US cannot claim to be based on blood - can it? The only way you can do it is by saying American == White.
At that point it stops being an ethnicity.
It's different than the Afrikaneers because they have a clearly defined ethnicity that doesn't allow newcomers."
"True - but to expand on that, can any European become American? I am riddled by the borders of the term, even if we restrict it to Whites."

"The political system and the religion are one and the same. You cannot divorce Islam of it's political aspect.

That said, it is a religion and thus in order to ban it - you would have to change the first amendment."

"Interesting redefining of global political ideologies by Anglin. Worth checking out.

"
"I agree, but my point is that a religion does not have to be tolerant to be a religion. That's an insane redefining of an ancient human concept."
True. Islam has to be banned. My point is that it is a religion - and pretending it isn't will make us look like fools.
Islam is the scourge of other religions yes. Does not stop it from being a religion itself.
"Did you have the freedom to abandon Christianity in medieval Europe?

Were they not a religion back then?

Either way, I see no reason to think a religion has to have freedom of choice. Seems an arbitrary distinction."

It's all quite stupid really."
"The country? Certainly. In fact there's rather much unholy about it.

The geographical area of Palestine is a different matter."
"Whatever man. If you think white history for the past 2000 years is a pile of ""Jewish"" shit, we're  clearly not in the same movement.

Have your spasms - won't change much for people who actually have a faith."
It's certainly an excellent notion to have a wielder of power that is easily identifiable and....removable - if he happens to betray his people that is.
"Hey it's certainly an interesting prospect to witness.

But until I see a functioning Pagan priesthood that is financed by believers that sacrifice a lot for their faith and as such allow the faith to wield political power - it's all a big LARP joke to me tbh."
"Calling the Christian God a ""Jew on the Stick"" shows very well how much you value your ancestors.

"For a non-Christian European nationalist certainly.

For Christians it holds a valuable dogmatic worth.

Unless you seek to ban Christian Europeans from Europe - you'll have to contend with that fact."
"My personal problem with Paganism (despite being Christian myself duh) is that they seem to have no grounding. No dogma.

It's just stories and myths at this point. Some customs have survived yes (though it's questionable how well they've been preserved), but there is no priesthood anymore. No set of laws.

It's moral anarchy based on a romantic aesthetic."
"It would be unfair to expect religiosity from people in this day and age.

It is something hard to grasp if you're not raised in it.

My stance is merely that the future generations should not be cursed with secular nihilism and be forced to deal with all these psychological issues when they grow up and start hating life."
"This is where nihilism gets you people.

"It's a strange bipolarity in the minds of the people bashing Christianity though.

"Good. Then I'm pleased for you.

If the Old Religions bring you real meaning, that's certainly good.

Do be wary of opportunists however. I've met too many ""pagans"" that were anything but.

Though to be fair there are a lot of ""Christians"" that are anything but as well hah."
"If you think this verse is teaching you to be a pussy, I don't think theological scripture is quite in your area of understanding.

Mercy is a gift only the strong can give.

Cowards don't need the Bible to be cowards."
"Pacifism motivated by courage is a rare thing. And there is certainly great virtue within it.

That said, modernity has made people into cowards. To them pacifism is a necessity, not a choice.

It's a deeper point to dwell on. I will say I have never met a brute that was turned into a coward by Christianity. It tempers and channels.

When it's real faith anyway."
"That is your choice. I think you'll see yourself within your lifetime how badly that tolerance will end for your country.

But then again, I pray not."
"I keep repeating it.

If an honest pagan wants to worship Odin or Perun - more power to him.

But if you LARP as one without really believing it. Praying to your gods. Living through them.

...get the fuck out. Stop insulting your heritage with that charade."
"I seek no quarrel with you friend - but please be honest and call yourself an atheist or at best an agnostic. We both know you don't believe in Odin.

I know real Pagans in real life and I assure you they do not see their gods as ""metaphores"". The very idea would offend them greatly.

In any case, do as you like. If real believers scare you or offend you - good luck."
"The ultimate test really is: Do I believe it? Do I see something transcendental in this faith? Does it speak to me in an esoteric sense?

I simply cringe at the overwhelming number of ""skeptics"" who smell their own farts by espousing a cynical view of religion.

As if it takes a big brain to be an atheist in the current year..."
"This is one of the stupider points atheist nationalists make.

Christianity does not teach you to be a coward. It teaches you to be brave and able to defend your faith - and it merely tempers it with the teaching of mercy.

No Saint or Martyr 'turned the other cheek' because they were afraid of a fight. This is an infantile lack of understanding of what asceticism is"
"No thanks.

Not a Vikingr.

My ancestors bled and died for the Cross. If following their example makes me non-European to some internet atheist viking LARPer, so be it."
"Certainly.

Though again be cautious about ""religion shopping"".

If you pick a faith because it aligns with your politics - your faith is rather dubious.

Religion informs morality and morality informs politics. Doesn't quite work in reverse."
"It goes deeper than that in my opinion.

It's not about deciding which religions are acceptable and which are not.

It's about BELIEVING in your religion. Having a fucking identity and actually taking it seriously.

As long as Europeans see religion/morality only as a flexible tool to be bent and twisted - they will have no place in this world."
"They're both parts of a cycle of history. The cycle of stagnation and decay that befalls all cultures at some point.

As societies become easy to live in - no hardships, no serious threat, no war -&gt; they become weak. They start being tolerant and self-absorbed. Individualism becomes the rule."
I can respect that interpretation. It needs to be reaffirmed it's for Christians only though.

"No...it's not.

My people have literally been at war with Islamists at our gates for centuries.

Islamic theocracy sure. But in the sense of the religious belief in Allah - I don't see how it disqualifies as a religion.

" Oh I agree with that. But there is a big difference between information and logic. You can act irrationally with new information, or you can act rationally. What the OP was about was that information or guidance should be provided. We can't rely on people to work it all out with logic"
" What it comes down to is - if logic is what made you change your mind, it would mean that precisely before changing your stance on f.e. the AltRight - you would have had to start using logic that was before unknown to you."
" I'm sure you think you changed your mind based purely on evidence and logic, but that is where everyone thinks their beliefs are derived from.

" Mhm, I'd love to get some directions as to where this Neverland of ubermensch philosophers might be so I may meet them. King's College? 4chan?

 You're making my point. I'm not saying you can't use logic to convince someone to believe what you believe - I'm saying you'll never use it (although theoretically you could) to change your own mind. Our minds do not want to be corrected. That's why logic alone will never change them.
" It is a utopian ideal to think you can forge such a person. I am yet to meet a person who used Wittgenstein or Aristotle to change their opinion on a single policy.
People change their beliefs because of real life experience, cultural conditioning and emotion. Logic is a post-facto operation."
" No one does. Even if a right winger wants to redpill someone - the ""use logic dude and come to your own conclusion"" line is just code for ""come to my conclusion or you're not using logic"".
That goes for everyone. "
" Thing is, that's not what they're thought. They are told to apply logic just as everyone else is. But in reality they don't do it.
And that is because we all think of ourselves as highly logical, but in reality it is our complex bias that guides us to a conclusion. Logic is just an excuse."

 I would agree. Personally the ultimate moral code is the preservation of a civilized society. Whatever it takes.
" Yes, but I am asking if you would discriminate against that group on a policy level in order to reduce the violence that they cause? f.e. introducing police hours or lockdowns on problematic areas."
 So what if a certain group has a far higher crime rate than other groups? I'm not going to let you get away with a cookie cutter good person answer 😀 
 What do you mean? Discriminating against immoral people?
" How massive of a threat? And yes I know they aren't, it can be some other group if you find it easier to contemplate discrimination that way...let's say Hindus or something. It really doesn't matter.
Bigotry, sexual assaults, theft, suicide bombings? Where does the buck stop for you?"
" What if hypothetically gay people had a very high chance of being mentally unstable (realistically this would be pretty applicable to trannies, but w/e). Would it be alright to discriminate based on that? I'm curious if discrimination is justifiable against a seemingly innocent party."

 True. It is a cultural dogma that's being pushed everywhere. I know two of my cousins were ruined by it - and they came from a very good family. It's really disgusting.

I can of course only speak for my own country.

It's especially insane for German Americans because a big part of what it means to be an American in 2018 is to be proud of killing Germans lol. Twice!

Not serious."
"That's a nice story, but I fail to see how you did not abandon your homeland.

I am not challenging whether you did so lawfully. I trust you did.

But you still left the home of your ancestors for a new one. One that did not belong to you at the time."
"Uhh yeah, they rejected their homeland and exchanged it for a new one.

America selected for individualism. For people who were sick of their original homeland and wanted to carve a new path for themselves.

I fail to see how this is not the case."

Serbian relationship with the Gypsies is complex and obviously cumbersome, just like the relationship between Gypsies and the rest of central and east Europe. In tiny Serbia (below 6 million residents) 400,000 Gypsies do reside! Yet according to a DNA-study forum, research has shown that almost no race-mixing took place throughout the centuries.

More on haplo-information, the Serbs are by some noted for their unique appearance. It's because of mixing with the early Dinaric races. It's not proven, but research shows it's quite plausible. This resulted in a typical build of the skull and usually lengthy Serbs.

At the same time, it must be noted that haplo-information is not a reliable indicator for accurate racial information. Despite the fairly unique markup(s) of the Serbian genoom, not much is known about their heritage.

"Ok cool.

Likewise, as long as we respect each other - I have no beef with any Pagan.

God bless cousin."
"Ok, so we have no problem then.

We have a small semantic disagreement that's all.

Not worth continuing this thread."
"lol

I said that in a half-joking positive context.

I wasn't insulting Paganism or saying that all Pagans lived in huts.

Sheesh. The Pagan I was talking to in that conversation understood that and wasn't triggered at all."
"If you say Christianity and White Nationalism are incompatible - that is an anti-Christian post. At least so in regards to WNs that are Christian.

I would think this is obvious.

But yet again, I seek no quarrel with Pagans that are as friendly to my religion as I am to theirs."
Ok. If I pin an anti-Pagan comment on my page I'm sure you won't comment on it either :)
"What? No.

That's perfectly fine with me.

How many times do I have to say it.

If you're Pagan and want to focus on cherishing your genuine faith - more power to you!

Are we good then? I'm offering an olive branch. Do your thing, I'll do mine - and we're good."
"So what do you really want here?

I've given you my argumentation. If you don't find it sufficient - stay a Pagan. I find it more than sufficient - and I'll stay a Christian.

Are you content with that?"

"When Vikings arrived in North America they were butchered and fled.

When Christians arrived in the Americas they butchered and conquered.

You might be right of course. But that is a 'what if' scenario.

I don't put my faith in alternative histories."
"Do you think Christians throughout history welcomed non-white invaders into their homes to rape and butcher them?

Were they not real Christians then?

You are weighing a few lines of scripture as more important than the whole history of Christian tradition.

Not serious."
"This is true.

I am not for one instant defending modern Christianity.

All your complaints on it are valid.

I am the kind of Christian that my forefathers were."
"No. It's responsible for creating a society that was responsible for developing the technology that allowed for space travel.

Over a long period of time of course."
"Of course not.

If you can help someone without endangering your own safety or the safety of your loved ones - of course you should do that.

Does Odinism not believe in providing a warm welcome for good-natured travellers?"
"Mate. Tell me in good faith now.

Is there something I can say that will change your mind?

I don't want to waste my time indulging a shitslinging competition.

If you want to parade around victorious for having more patience for that than me, I'm happy to give you that."
"Perhaps you should read the whole thread before judging a 50th reply I made in response to someone else?

I was saying that Paganism provided for a simpler lifestyle that was different from the more civilization-oriented Christianity that prospered organically in Rome and Greece.

Calling me historically illiterate is not bringing negativity? Ok."
"I have.

You merely refuse to accept it.

Christianity is inherently pro-white because it provides a civilizational framework that makes whites prosper and expand.

I stopped trying to argue in good faith because we both know by now that you have a personal vendetta here and that there is nothing I can say that will shake your contempt for Christian heritage."
"Oh I went from a kike worshipper to a full kike now.

Cool.

Let's see where this story ends :)"
Correct.
"Pff what would the SS know about National Socialism.

Don't be silly. Real National Socialists hate Christianity.

Hitler banned it as soon as he came into power right?"
Congratulations.
"Yep, you win.

Good for you.

I'm just a dumb Christian. I'll go worship my 'dead kike on a stick' now."
"I've noticed that trend.

I have many Pagan friends here in E. Europe and we're all respectful of our traditions.

Americans on the other hand go ballistic with this stuff.

Constant shitslinging for no reason."
"Alright then.

Good luck with gathering a second ""Great Heathen Army"" to free your homeland from Muslims one day.

You're not making friends among Christians in E. Europe with that mindset.

Have fun."
"If you call Christianity an Abrahamic religion contrary to the interests of whites - that is an attack.

If I say ""Why should we return to living in mud huts and throwing rocks like Pagans did?""

Is that a genuine ""just a question"" or is it a malicious attack?

I repeat - I am content to drop the matter.

If you persist in ""questioning"" Christianity, we can only be foes."
"That's fair. And I understand the appeal of it.

I just prefer the ""oppressive"" nature of monotheism.

I won't think any less of any of my brothers that have a different preference to mine."
"This is true.

Maybe Rome would have done the same without Christianity.

We can't really tell or guess."
"All my heroes were ardent Christians.

All our national legends are about Christians defending our lands from foreign invaders of different religions.

My grandfather died fighting for the Cross, as have many before him.

If you attack them, you attack me yes."
"The Roman Empire and the Hellenics were great civilizations. I have nothing bad to say about them.

And I am very historically literate. Feel free to make sure of that if you wish.

I will not bring any negativity to this conversation that you don't bring yourself.

If you're happy with Odin - bless you."
The fact you see faith and race as competing and having different interests - is what makes you not see the point of religion.
"Christianity brought order and purpose.

It brought stability.

Civilization if you want to use that term.

I actually will grant you that this meant a certain form of subjugation. So it comes down to what you value more - anarchic freedom or formal order of a state."
"If you say so.

Seems to me you're missing the point of religion as a whole - which is way worse.

But we can bury the hatchet - no point sperging on about this. You have your thing, I have mine."
"I get the tribal allure of staying in huts. Honestly I do.

But suggesting the people who converted to Christianity were cowards for not staying in their little villages but rather subjugated the planet.....just doesn't add up fam."
"Ok, so if it's most relevant, it's most deserving of a response/comment."
"It's your pinned question on your profile (not replying to anyone directly that I could see).

One would assume this is what you want people to see first when opening your page."
"I mean like - Pagans convert to Christianity and proceed to conquer the world and go into space.

Seems like an upgrade to me fam."
"That we do not disagree on.

So where is the issue?

If I say I put ethnicity above religion and that I am a Christian - what is the problem?

The Christians that don't behave accordingly? They are far from NatSocs anyway so I don't see what your audience is for that question."
"Right. And yet they believed in Heaven enough to die for it for a thousand years after.

Does that make Heaven more worth dying for? Maybe."
"Pretty much every great white person we remember was a Christian.

That's just facts.

If modern Christianity has flaws (which it does) - it's easier to fix them than abandon our entire racial heritage."
"Alright fine. I think we cleared up the confusion.

In your opinion Christians cannot be National Socialists. I disagree, but that is more a matter of semantics I'm guessing.

In any case - Clerical Fascism is as good a label as any."
"Oh absolutely. I don't think the ones who resisted were bad people.

Conviction and true faith is always admirable."
"Ok then. Guess I'm not a National Socialist by your definition then.

Codreanu and Ljotic resonate with me more than Himmler.

If that makes us enemies rather than allies, I'm sad to hear so.

I'm not going nuclear, I'm just tired of atheists bashing my religion that's all."
"Right. And now no one remembers them.

And the greatest achievements of our people were achieved by those who did convert.

So..yeah. feelsgoodman"
"No...

You aren't defending Christianity.

If I was proactively pushing Christianity but didn't believe in the Bible - that would be the equivalent of what you're doing.

I'll ask you then ok? Maybe I was presumptious.

Do you believe in the Eddas? Yes or no? Honestly?"
"In response to your anti-Christian posts/question yes.

That's called 'reacting' or 'responding'.

Do you believe Leon DeGrelle, Tiso, De Rivera, Ljotic, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and the countless German and Italian NatSoc soldiers weren't really NatSocs for being Christian fundamentalists?

Really?"
"You just said yourself you're an agnostic/atheist. That you just like the morality of Odinism.

Are you serious? Like should I quote you to remind you?"
"What are you talking about?

You're actively trying to detach Christians from their religion. Which can hurt them.

I repeat - I will NEVER try to convert or rob a pagan of his genuine faith in a deity of his choice.

I again urge you to find me ever posting any proactive anti-Pagan messaging anywhere.

I only respond when Christianity is attacked."
"Because you don't believe in them.

Snowhite and the 7 dwarves would be religious texts if people believed in them fervently.

But you don't. So they're just fairytales."
"95% of normies are fully engaged with globalism.

That's the current zeitgeist.

I will not answer for American or German Christians, but I know Christianity is a bedrock of my own people.

If you wish to offer an alternative - we can listen.

But you can't offer us atheism. No thank you."
"What they say right now.

Look here is the thing.

If you can get the majority of whites to truly believe in Odin/Perun again - go for it.

I have nothing against it.

It just doesn't seem like a genuine belief to me. More like a moral code with some LARPing thrown in.

Eddas are not religious texts. They're a part of our heritage, but I don't see myself dying over them."
"Look - believe what you want, but 90% of Pagans I've met just really hate modern Christianity and take on ""paganism"" without actually believing it. It's like a hobby in ways.

Apologies to the ones that aren't like that and genuinely embrace the Old Ways."
"They're not.

You are quoting specific verses that go against the whole history of European Christianity.

On the other hand - Odinism has no moral code other than what modern agnostics/atheists assume or invent their ancestors would have believed.

If Odinism had a multiple hundred thousand pages of scripture - I assure you we could weasel out similar verses"
"Good luck with that.

They're by far the most fucked up."
"So what are you?

I've seen you claim to be American and E. European. Pagan and not Pagan.

Are you just an esotheric atheist-nationalist or what?

I disagree with Christianity not having an ethnic component.

In the US, sure. In E. Europe Christian butchered Christian over nationality as recently as a decade or two ago."

If the future ethnostate nation of yours decides to ban Paganism in the interests of the nation - would you obey?

Or would you say that your faith and your nation cannot be seperated?"

Over here it got a lot worse not so long ago.

Still, I have hope (even if it's naive) that we can patch things up and confederate.

Unlike the French, the Brits, the Germans, the Italians, etc.. - the Balkan natives never united into a single super-ethnicity. That's why we've suffered much hardship."

It's just doing the same thing you've been doing so far. Voting red and shitposting.

Literally nothing new, brave, interesting or revolutionary about it."
"That's a fair point.

I've never heard any of these ""infiltrate the GOP"" types give any timeframe in which they intend to achieve it.

If they shoot low, like by 2024 - they'll sound insane.

If they try to be realistic they'll say 2050 - but by then it'll be game over. So it's best to dance around the issue and keep trying to make a river flow upstream."
"Non-whites just doesn't work for me.

That's an opinion, so feel free to disregard it. But there are too many immigrants, holding on to their original culture, and yet calling themselves Australian."
"If mainstream media is telling you what the ""good side"" in a war is, just assume it's the opposite.

Easy rule of thumb for now."
"&gt;We are a distinct people

&gt;All whites are the same

Pick one. Because mate, either Americans are a racial group or you're an ethnic group. You can't have both.

As for your point about expats - I would accept any Serbian-American back with open arms. Blood is blood."
Which would make sense.
"Perhaps it's a consequence of the British Empire, as the original globalist Empire...I cannot say.

There are things required for me to take a group seriously as a national body:

f.e.

1. History of common suffering&amp;struggle - in nation wars and such

2. Common religion (""Christianity"" does not count, you need a church)

3. Ethnic rivalries (who is excluded?)"
"I said, not enough time - under the condition that new arrivals are accepted every year in insane numbers, and I would also add under the provision that this ""nation"" has not fought in any wars with a direct national interest.

The problem I talk about is a distinctly WASP problem, as all British former colonies have the same issue.

1/2"
"Yeah I would say the same for Australia.

150 years is not enough time to form national identity - not if you are accepting insane amounts of new members every year.

My post doesn't have a ""goal"". I am merely speaking what I see as true.

It's clear to me why it's so important for Americans to push this ""all whites are the same"" line.

I'm just not buying. Sorry."
"You do you man.

I am unconvinced of the validity of the American ethnicity - but if you're secure and happy with it, you shouldn't care about what I think on the topic.

Peace."

&gt;It's not his fault, he's confused (wasn't he the 4d chess master?)

"I sometimes regret not pursuing a church vocation as well.

It is a very serene and meaningful vocation, it seems to me."
Amazing place. Well worth the visit.
"Touched a nerve there have I?

You're a European too cousin, just a prodigal one.

I've been to the States many times and I assure you I was never homeless during my stays :)

Nor on wellfare."
"Oh we'll see.

I respect China/Japan quite a bit, and they are ahead of us in that regard - but I think the march of globohomo nihilism is worming its way into every society.

If Saudi Arabia legalized female drivers - I can see where the wind is blowing long term.

That is unless the heart of the Evil Empire is ripped out and burned. God willing."
"I don't think any nation is safe.

That doesn't make the existence of different nations any less relevant though. Quite the contrary."
"If 200 years is more important to your identity than 10000 years before that - no. You should be content.

What makes an American though? Being white? Or is there some other requirement?

Can I move and become one of you within one generation? I think I could. Easily even."
"Alt right disappeared because:

&gt;It had no spiritual foundation

&gt;It did not set any ideology in stone

The lack of spiritual foundation is the most important. Without it all there's left: utilitarian morality - no better than left. I recall that one time it argued if faggots can be altright

Without it there can be no coherent ideology - again no better than left"
AMEN
"So we win by convincing people there is no hope?

Yeah ok. Good luck with that. I think I won't try that with my countrymen, but you do you."
Nice. So you're a real American.
"You're projecting a whole lot of assumptions based (it seems to me) on only your own experience and condition to the rest of the world.

I see hope and I see value in the people around me, even if they can be misguided.

My nation's heart still beats, and my God still lives. If you feel yours does not - I empathize.

But please, keep the gloom&amp;doom to yourself."
"Some could I'll grant you, but whether due to 'being nice', or the demographic necessity, I haven't seen WN Americans express any interest in setting down ethnic/cultural requirements for what defines an ethnic American.

It would alienate a lot of it's potential members if you went about flaunting the Anglo heritage too much."
"Hehe that's alright.

Been to Ohio recently - nice state."
This should be a frequently used meme.
"This is what libertarians need to accept:

There are circumstances where your free market interests can guide you to do something counter-productive for your society. In these cases the state should, will and must slam down on your right to turn a profit.

Enough autism.

The health of the nation is far more important than fucking money."
"Ideally I would prefer a one-party nationalist system.

But if you have to have a democracy, the ""two parties"" system is by far the worst kind.

Divides the nation into two and pits brother against brother. All the while no real difference is made and the capitalist elite keeps getting their way no matter who wins the sham elections."
"I feel more at ease in freaking China (as a white person) than in the big US cities.

The multiculti environment is incredibly bad for the psyche. Tribalism is what we're used to. Seeing everything mixed up is unnatural."
"Clearly there were issues with the Catholic church of the time. These should've been addressed.

That said, the answer Protestantism provided was far worse than the problem it sought to solve.

And yes, the Orthodox churches were mostly subjugated by the Tatars or the Ottomans at the time and as such mostly lived in poverty just like their flocks."
"What in the world is your point?

That Hus was a reformer?

Random morons on the internet are a fucking pain in the ass."
"The US and the UK have the most depressing electoral systems I've ever seen.

There is no chance of anything changing democratically in those two countries ever.

You have no choice. Same answer under both a) and b)."
"Pretty much.

This is just a game for a lot of them."
Pretty much my impression sadly.
Yeah? Hus wasn't a Calvinist.
"Aye true. Still a lot of those are pretty shitty jobs. Add student debt...who knows.

In any case, I think Americans have to improve their game.

The AltRight showed hope with CVille, but guess they just lost their courage and fled back to their echo chambers."
"When Calvinists and other Protestant heresies first proclaimed material wealth a sign of spiritual virtue...it all went downhill.

Modesty and ascetism is what makes Christianity beautiful, not disgusting megachurch preachers throwing bills around."
"I don't know man.

There's plenty of poverty-stricken veterans and other homeless folk in the US.

More than enough to forment anger.

It just seems to me like the US selected through history for selfishness and individualism.

People are raised to not care about those down on their luck.

To care always first and foremost for their own security and well being."
"Yep. Same in most countries in Europe.

Even really cucked and censored ones like Germany or Sweden have very active dissident movements.

Meanwhile in the ""land of guns and freedom"" they can't get 50 guys to show up out of a 220+ mill population.

That shows a cultural problem of the American spirit/mind. Imo."
"No one in politics ever acts out of altruism. No one was suggesting that.

The idea is that the PRC, Iran, Russia and White Nationalists in the West share the same enemy: ZOG America.

And you are absolutely correct. All I do or say is dedicated to the interests of my people, to the best of my intentions anyhow.

So it should be with all people."
"I think the demographics of Gab have changed somewhat.

#BanIslam might be too moderate for a trending topic these days hah."
"More important than looking like heroes is actually being them.

Peak optics mean nothing if one is too afraid to show his face on the street."
"That depends on what you consider the broader American culture.

I consume and like a lot of it myself, but yes undoubtedly there are many aspects of it that I despise."
"You have an incredibly jaded view of China (pun intended).

I would rather move to Bejing than to New York or LA. Wouldn't even have to think twice.

And yes, I'd rather be ruled by any of those 3 over being ruled by the current US establishment."
"If you're an American, do listen to this.

You have to understand what European Nationalists see when they observe American ""Nationalists"" scramble and fail to produce a genuine Nationalist movement.

There is a big psychogical problem with the American middle class.

I guess sarcasm flies right over the heads of anti-whites.
*insert Crowder meme - prove me wrong*
"Just a throwback to an age of heroes and martyrs.

Few today have the courage of their convictions as Captain Codreanu did.

"
"As Gab is seen to be the hub of the ""white nigger bowlcut fed pipe bombers"", and this offer of peace and cooperation is shared here...

I do wonder if you posted something similar on the TRS forums or wrote an article calling for unity on DS?

It seems to me only one side is called on to ""unify"", while the other pursues Stasi levels of dissent-banning."
"China would give White America a run for its money.

A ZOGed up America however? Forget about it, Beijing will slam dunk DC within our lifetimes."
On the late end of it. During the transition.
"Unlike American education - the former Soviet block had a rigorous and extensive focus on world history.

I probably know more about the American Civil War than most Americans yeah. Visited all the battlefields even."
Alex Ramos now convicted on malicious wounding. The evil that exudes from the City of Charlottesville and this whole one-sided miscarriage of justice should be sickening to any fair-minded person.
"I think the leaders of it are just too scared to risk imprisonment or bodily harm if they pursue RL activism.

They prefer to sit on their paycuck money and just enjoy being edgy online.

Hard to tell what their real thoughts and intentions are obviously."

"I'd use it for kindling.

I don't want to soil my ass with that Zionist rag."
"Fine, I'll even concede that might be true.

It might even be a useful strategy - but I'm not arguing whether it's useful.

I'm arguing whether it's true.

And it's not.

American Nationalism is Neoconservatism or Trump populism.

It does not stand for white people, and if it ever does in the future it will be too late for anyone to care."
"E. Europe.

Visited America many times though."
"Agreed.

The Confederacy always seemed preferable to me, even when I was an apolitical little kid.

Its cause had an air of virtue and righteousness while the Union had only the cold embrace of death and greed."
"Agreed 100%.

That was a short debate lol."
"The US flag today is about as white American as the USSR flag was white Russian after WW1.

Get over it. It's a soiled symbol of evil."
"That's a strategy, and one that I might find some merit to, though ultimately I think it's problematic as it might lead people astray into GOP slavery.

But hey, that's fine. The issue is that people insist on maintaining the US as it is under all cost, which is unrealistic.

It is a decadent empire that will collapse. Whites should prepare for the aftermath."
"I'd love to see a blood sports on this topic.

If you mean debate it with me on here - yeah we can do that.

My stance on it is that Americanism is the problem, not the solution.

If you wish to elaborate your own take I'd love to hear."
"Striker, you should know by now that the personal vanity of the optics cucks will never allow them to align with ""white niggers"" again.

Their liberal bias is too strong and the dopamine rush of judging lower class whites is too high.

I don't think you're going to repair this divide. You are the only person on TRS/TDS that is even willing to talk to the other side."
"What these people do is create a caricature of everything they don't like and apply it to anyone who levies criticism at them that they can't address

Their exaggerated Strawman caricatures of their opposition are only reinforced by thought-policing moderation creating an echo chamber where they never address the thoughts or ideology of their detractors"
"The leader of the far-right party in Serbia refuses to disavow our WW2 fascist leader and instead proclaims he was a great man.

So yes, we do not disavow. We do not back down. That is the only way you can win."
"Little is pursuing a vendetta against them now. No truce possible there I don't think.

But yes, both of them were deemed too honest. Irony and passive-aggressive remarks (female traits) are considered preferable in the AmNat crowd."
"I guess they just underestimated the loyalty of their crowd to the ideals over loyalty to their ""leaders"".

No self-respecting white would start a class war while dressed like a retard so he could appear ""more mainstream""."
"Nah they dindu nuffin.

Just explicitly stated that they want to kick out half the movement and join the GOP.

Which I am yet to hear be denied or addressed by anyone on that side of the fence.

We have the proof. No one has tackled it. On TDS or TRS. One would assume then that they agree with it."
"Those guys support  . As for the fed accusation, lol.

If you think ""snitches"" announce they're snitches on social media - you're beyond help."
"I am still waiting for a single AmNat to actually sit down and discuss this.

But there's nothing. Just radio silence or immediate virtue signalling about how much higher value white they are for wearing clown shoes.

They are afraid of debating the validity of their political theory because they know somewhere deep down that they have nothing but 4d chess."
I don't go there anymore but I do see links here on Gab. One the other day was a headline whining about the Mueller investigation. Yeah I give a shit about Trump's problem with Mueller while our guys are going to jail and all speech is shutting down.
"My list of people that can die in a fire when SHTF:

1. Anybody that wears niggershoes.

2. Anybody that supports Douglass Mackey or Weev.

Shortly followed by anti-Whites and non-Whites."
Only TWP would show up to 10 to 1 odds. They got attacked for it because these guys didn't like their jacket
"At least they're being honest with their contempt for what they perceive as ""lower value"" whites.

It's good to know whom not to help when shit hits the fan."
"Yeah, I was in a state of disbelief over that for a long time. I couldn't grasp their position on the issue because it was petty, ungrateful and dishonorable. The Antifa were throwing acid on the people at the shieldwall"
"Good video. Very true.

Kai Murros explains the core root problem of WASP Americanist mentality perfectly."

Thanks for giving me a chuckle. You're a walking meme."

As long as he doesn't counter signal real life action - I see no problem with his intellectual daydreaming.

What that particular part was saying is that we should have a fanatical devotion to our people.

The problem with Fuentes, for me at least, is not his 15% castizo blood. It's his arrogance and stupidity in terms of strategy."

Of course, that said, I'm not interested in living in the US."
"Ricky Vaughn is a GOP lobbyist that used an anon personality to infiltrate and redirect the Alt Right into becoming more mainstream and GOP friendly.

"I'm not against it. Go for it if you want.

I see White Nationalism as a wider net which is to serve as an alliance of various white ethnic groups. Of course I support that.

As for racial identity - I don't see it as sufficient to build a nation no. You could forge an ethnicity in the US over many centuries of closed borders sure, but it doesn't currently exist."

"The fact you have to use race instead of ethnicity is sign enough that you yourself are aware there is no such thing as an American ethnicity.

Race is what is used, because America is such a melting pot that every identity has been shaken and stirred so much that all premise of an ethnic identity sounds crazy to all normies.

"If the vast majority of the UK believes there is no ethnic component to being British - yes. Nationalism in Britain is dead at that point.

The kosher sandwich makes GOP voters little cuckold bitches every cycle tbh."
"I would.

I'd say the same for my country if it stopped believing it has an ethnic component.

There is no nationalism except ethnic nationalism. And you must admit 99% of Americans believe there is no such thing as an American ethnicity.

It's not personal. It's just following the definition."

It depends on the country I suppose.

"Uhh. No offense mate, but double check your history there.

Aztecs and Incas were significantly after European paganism (like 1400 years later). Not a fair comparison.

I heard good things about the Traditional one, but I am unaware of all the theological positions it holds.

Do you still accept (((Pope Francis))) as the leader? Or is there some sort of an anti-pope?"
"I do not blame them. That is why I approach every pagan with due respect and only respond to attacks on Christianity as a historical religion of Europeans.

As for the current Catholic church - it absolutely deserves to be attacked on many fronts for betraying its own core traditions.

I respect that choice.
"Absolutely. There are other examples of this besides the religious aspect.

A certain nihilistic element has wormed its way into far-right politics. One that seeks to make everything a big joke and a meme.

"A movement that claims Christianity is about ""worshiping a kike-on-a-stick"" is not one I wish to have any part in.

It would be a movement that is ashamed of the greatest achievements of the white race. To be one of those people is to spit on the greatest chapters of our history.

As you say, offer alternatives. Don't simply tear down."
They all serve Jews.
"I am also proud of our pagan roots, and I would never forsake those traditions that still remain from those times (of which E. Europeans preserved a fair amount).

However, all the greatest heroes of my history have been Christians.

To be Serbian is to be an Orthodox Christian.

I understand you lack that religious definition as an American, so it is different."
"I absolutely empathize with these people, the ""Christian"" churches in the West are pretty much satanic at this point.

I disavow all of them. Everyone should feel free to attack them.

That said, some insist on attacking the religion itself, which simply lacks validity in the historical context."

"Well, way I see it is - 3 options:

1) Reconnect with your majority heritage, if you're not completely mixed into oblivion by now ofc

2) Marry into a heritage, f.e. your daughter can marry a Russian or a Greek and adopt that heritage, or

3) Form a new one on the American continent - keeping in mind that ethnicity requires many years to build with many requirements."

"Of course.

"Well I challenge you to find one post of mine that attacks Paganism unprovoked in any context.

Our interaction today started with me answering an attack on Christianity by a 3rd party."
"See I agree with what you're trying to convey - but I again see no need for hostility or putting down one's ancestors - regardless of their station and religion in the past.

There is simply no reason for white men to argue over which one of their grandfathers was a bigger piece of shit.

If you have to compare - argue which one was greater."
"Please do.

I find that number unbelievable. Based purely on real life experiences - whites alone being barely 50% these days, and a lot of them being recent arrivals...that's yeah, hard to buy."
"You're making my point for me.

You have no ethnic rivalry - as 'Yankee' isn't an ethnic group anymore.

You have no official faith - as you proudly proclaim.

You seemingly have no historical heritage, as I am guessing here you think people like Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson were stupid foreign-faith worshiping leftists?

So what is American identity?"
"What percentage of Americans can trace at least 50% of their ancestors to having lived in the US pre-1900?

I'm guessing that's 20% at best.

Not denying that there once was a historic American nation (thinking Civil War type stuff), but it's been watered down beyond reason. With Pepsi probably.

What's your official Church? Your ethnic rivalries? MIA."
"If America had an identity/race/religion to absorb yes.

And if 'limited' meant 'unlimited'."
"Finally, any white person could become one of us if they are married to one of us and is comfortable with fully abandoning his former loyalties/identity and embracing our traditions, religion, culture, etc... 100%.

Under these circumstances, with the aforementioned ""cultural amnesia"", a limited number of any whites could be welcomed.

"I can best explain by using my country as an example on how I understand/feel about it.

If the person is of a closer ethnic group (another Slav perhaps, or a Romanian, or a Hungarian, etc..) he is more likely to fit in and should be welcomed with certain precautions.

If the person is at least 50% Serbian, in my mind they are one of us and should be welcome.

1/2"
"I don't think I should tell other people what to feel in that regard.

If they think a new identity is their only option - they should go for it.

All I can say is that there are rules and requirements for an ethnicity to exist, and people need to understand for you to be X, there has to be other people excluded from being X.

It can't be open for all whites. Not real."
"lol

Not one of those is even remotely correct.

-Not mixed race (white as snow)

-God is above the state, but I see how confusing it would be for an atheist to comprehend that

I don't say that out of spite mind you. I say it because it's true.

To repeat the dog analogy: no dog is 100% one breed per se - but let's not pretend that makes breeds a redundant concept. That's a biological fallacy."
"No.

There is no absolute racial purity and I am not primarily a racialist.

Ethnicity is what I care about, and a significant part of that is culture and a more abstracted identity.

There is a world of difference however between someone whose ancestors lived in the same area for 500+ years and someone who has no idea what he even is."
"Pretty much.

He'll silently go away after his term is done and everyone will forget...

But I will say that I generally argue for syncretism with both our Christian and Pagan heritage taken into account - and for that I am usually attacked by both sides, though more often by Pagans. In my experience."
"As you prefer.

I maintain that history has shown the supremacy of Christianity in pushing whites to greater heights.

But I bear no ill will towards Pagans, so long as they show us the same courtesy."
"I'm not Roman Catholic. So yeah duh.

And I agree that European Christianity is a syncretism with local traditions.

And I disagree with what you suggest is a sinister motive behind all Christian churches."
"And Pagans never had a state at all, let alone a fascist one.

Except the Greeks and Romans, and most Nordicists spit on those civilizations from what I've seen.

My impression from most Pagans is that they seek to emulate tribalism from the pre-Roman era.

I am simply uninterested in that."
"Sure, but that's not the point.

De Rivera was an ardent Catholic too as far as I'm informed."
"Secular Authority is the Authority of Brute Force.

You don't want a God. You don't want metaphysics. You don't want absolute truths without evidence.

Thus you don't want religion in the sense that Europeans have practiced for hundreds of years.

This I disagree with. I believe the above are a key ingredient in the glories that whites have achieved in the past few centuries."
"A part of the problem in this stance is that it seems to me a lot of modern pagans arrived to where they are at by ""shopping"" for religion.

That in itself is a bad root for true belief.

As for Bushido - it's a Japanese warrior code. Not a religion.

You might as well offer Gorilla Mindset as a religion at that point."
"Aye. Which is why it's not a centralized, authoritarian religion.

The authority is, you could argue, somewhat secular. Because there is no divine recipe, merely what the will of the strongest commands at a given time.

Which I see the appeal of in a way, but it is not a good foundation for a strong civilization. Imo."
"Interesting. Well I have no problem with you brother, I believe we're on the same side.

Even if you take theological issue with Christianity, I do argue a measured stance on it, if merely for pragmatic reasons of unity.

We do not need inter-racial religious wars in our current predicament."
"Aye, but the 10 commandments are backed up by book upon book of further clarification and canon from hundreds of years of Christian development and literature.

My issue is primarily with the lack of authority in Paganism. How do you prove that this or that moral teaching is in fact the correct one.

Example would be polygamy. Is it ok or not? Why?"
"Modern Jews do not by any means associate with Jesus, so by their own testament they are anti-Christian.

And your take here is a reasonable stance."
"And these rites are given to us by some dudes in the 20th century?

And are pretty general to say the least. Could apply to most if not all religions from what I see.

I'm not trying to bash here, but I just don't see sufficient material to guide the masses here.

What do we do with adulterers? With faggots? With false testament? With polygamy? No conclusive authority"
"And am I to take it you're from an Orthodox country?

Or from a secular one? Or what?"
"That's because there is tons of scripture in Christianity that you can dig up various passages on and take issue with various conflicting statements.

There is no scripture or moral code for paganism. It seems to me to be a ""do what feels right"" kind of thing, which I don't see as sufficient.

If you can guide me to a comprehensive moral code, I'll gladly read it."
"You also have to understand that if you maintain this rhetoric of ""Jewish God"", ""Kike on a stick"", etc.. - you're not converting people, you're just alienating your Christian comrades.

So if you wish to persist in being hostile, that's fine - but I see little benefit to you and our cause, besides dealing with your own insecurities with your belief system."
"Never happened yet.

Paganism has been irrelevant politically for over 1000 years.

As I said earlier, when I see it become relevant - I'll consider it."
"Ofc. I was using ""call"" in the general sense."
"Call me when a Pagan fascist movement accomplishes anything greater than throwing a bonfire.

I'll reconsider my stance then."
"All of pre-WW2 history begs to differ, but do as you like.

I am tired of defending Christianity to people who have never known anything better than Protestant bullshit and cucked Catholic pedos.

If going to the woods is your thing, go for it. Let my people do their thing.

Unlike your churches, ours still have some decency."
"Sure. Look, I have no beef with those who choose to return to the Old Ways.

It's a part of our heritage too. If you're happier with Odin, Zeus or Perun - great, I'm happy for you.

But I have to come out swinging when certain people aren't content with just being pagan, but seek to attack my faith as well.

Otherwise, we should co-operate against common foes."
"It's a hypothetical, but I can't base my identity on an alternate universe.

My pride comes from my ancestors. If these ancestors protected my home under the banner of Christ - I will do so too.

And if it makes you uncomfortable - simply ignore scripture if you prefer.

But to mock my father and his father before him as ""kike-worshipers""? I'd rather slit my wrists."
Next holiday I take -&gt; straight to Tehran.
"The recorded history of my people, the stories and heroes that it celebrates, the great battles and heroic sacrifices, the blood that was spilled and tears that were shed - were all done in the name of Christianity.

Without Christian monasteries - my people would be Muslim Turks today.

And so - I will rather die than abandon or put down that heritage."
"Do you think the Russians committing pogroms, Spaniards burning heretics, or Fascists of WW2 saw their Lord as a ""dead kike on a stick""?

Sorry but there is a long tradition of Christian anti-semitism.

So I have no idea what you people think you're achieving by spitting on 1000-2000years (depending on area) of your own history based on 50 years of Zionist lies."
"Did you read the passage you quote?

Almost every fascist leader I can think of has accepted Christianity as a vital element of their ideology."
"Likewise, you do you.

When you get your utopian Odinist state set up - I'll gladly eat my words and start praying to trees.

And I don't say that with malice.

I honestly have nothing against paganism as part of our heritage. I just find it unrealistic as a bedrock of society in the way Christianity is.

If you can pull it off though - awesome."

Our cities will burn, but new ones will be built.

As for nonwhites - they will feast and grow decadent as they have done before. No worries."
"Theoretically yes.

Though it would involve many years, if not decades, of death, suffering and war.

So I would argue there are better ways to get what we want. But the whitepill in all this is that even if we lose - mankind will go back to what is good and decent anyway given enough time.

But I'm afraid I do believe the American state is going to die, and it will not be possible to save it.

That's just my opinion though. We'll see how it plays out."
"Sure. As previously stated, Russians and Germans have a long history of migration.

The problem is not having some minorities. That's fine.

We have Hungarians in northern Serbia. They have their thing, we have our thing. No problem.

But they know that Serbia belongs to us. They are our cherished friends. But they are not Serbs.

That distinction must exist."

"The #Douma #WW3 hoax is having one good effect already: It's clarifying the dividing line between genuine nationalists (vocally opposed to Trump's sabre-rattling) on one side, and the fakes on the other.

Not just Pamela Geller and Milo, but also Tommy Robinson and Generation Identity. Silent.

Lauren Southern - silent. By contrast though, #BrittanyPettibone is bang on message.

On the Alt-Right, even those who've been slow off the mark now seem to be getting it.

And that matters. Especially once the shooting starts, it will be hard for a while to stick to the anti-war and therefore pro-Russian position. Once the body bags start coming home all of us in #TeamPutin are going to get slagged off and demonised even further.

But we must hold the line, because we are right. And, provided the whole thing doesn't go nuclear and make this all academic, then time will prove us right. 

And THAT'S when the window may open for REAL resistance and radical change. Elites that lose wars fall, and the Anglo-Zionists will lose the war. The only question is whether they kill us all in doing so.

Which means that everyone who opposes the war - including creatures like #JeremyCorbyn - are on the side of Good. And everyone who supports it or hides in cowardly or convenient silence, is on the side of Evil. It's white or black, there are no shades of grey in this ultimate conflict.

Assad and Putin's forces have won in Ghouta, with the last Jihadist pocket in Douma guaranteed to fall within days, so why on earth would they risk it all by using chemical weapons and giving Nato the excuse to step in and save their rebel proxies?

The Russian defence minister warned last month that the rebels were making chemical weapons to carry out a false flag attack. Now they've done it. If the West rewards their cynical brutality by falling for their trick then they'll keep on doing it and more innocents will die.

Please use this info to argue the case for keeping OUT of Syria all over social media. Because dying in a nuclear war caused by Western politicians supporting Al Qaeda would be a really stupid way for us all to go!

Am I wrong?"
"Everyone freaking out at  I don't really know the deal with Ricky Vaughn, so I'm not starting beef with him by any means. 

But, I recognized something in Nehlen immediately. I'm quite positive that he carries the Berserker gene, also called Warrior gene. It's been written up about. A carrier will ""respond more aggressively to perceived threats."" 

Because I went through a couple years of hell with medical issues, I did my DNA analysis and ran my data through everything I could find and was literally looking up individual genes in my sequence. I found I had a double copy - meaning one from each parent! BOY did that explain a LOT in my life! And about me :P 

People get mad at me all the time on the internet! I've been nervous that Nehlen will be mad at me because we hold different religious views! 

But let me tell you something about people with the warrior gene. You poke at us, and bloody hell we're going to defend ourselves and our own. But, as you saw earlier tonight, WE CLOSE RANKS TO OUTSIDE THREATS. 

In terms of my views, I see these AR shit posters posting all kinds of bullshit like ""after the race war we're gonna kill all the pagans"" all the flipping time, and sure, I react to it by being more aggressive about MY beliefs. But the second I saw an article going around today that said the UK was arresting Christian ministers for their views today? My instinct is to close ranks and stand with these Christian brothers against those who would silence us ALL. 

I can't speak for the Ricky Vaughn situation. But I can tell you I saw a kindred spirit in Paul Nehlen from the get go. He might have pissed you off with an action that was seen as foul play. I'll tell you something. If you choose a WARRIOR, expect he's gonna piss you the fuck off once in awhile. 

He's never dealt with the flipping Alt Right before. Ya'll are not an easy bunch and you know it.

We've all learned from this. Let's move on."

You can agree or disagree with whether they should have done that, but what's not debatable is that they succeeded."
"Sure, I think we are in agreement.

My point was that the American intellectual thought rarely, if ever, dabbled in authoritarian and collectivist themes. Indeed, the New American Man is the very image of individualism.

For better or for worse. And I would have to say it's for the worse."

"Our Lord’s Instructions on How to Deal with Heresy

(Given to the Apostles before Ascension; from Maria Valtorta’s ‘Poem of Man-God,’ Vol. 5, pp. 854)

“Fight the heresy itself with all your strength, but, with every means, try to convert the heretics to the Lord.  Never get tired in looking for the sheep that have gone astray in order to take them back to the Fold.   Pray, suffer, and get people to pray and suffer, and go around begging the pure, the good, the generous believers for sacrifices and sufferings because these are the means to convert your brothers.  The Passion of Christ continues in Christians.  I have not excluded you from this great work, which is the Redemption of the world.  You are all members of the one single body.  Help one another, and let those, who are strong and healthy, work for the weaker ones, and those, who are united, stretch out their hands and call their brothers who are far away.

There will be some who will separate from you and go away for so many reasons.  They will still have My Name.  And what is even more, they will take pride in That Name.  They will work to make it known.  They will help in making Me known as far as the extreme boundaries of the earth.  Let them do, because, I remind you, who is not against Me is for Me.  Bur poor children!  Their work will always be incomplete, their merits always imperfect.  They cannot be in Me, if they are separated from the Vine.  Their work will always be incomplete.  You, I say you referring to your future successors, must be where they are.  Do not say pharisaically: ‘I’m not going in order not to be contaminated,’ or lazily, ‘I’m not going because there already is who preaches the Lord,’ or timidly, ‘I’m not going in order not to be driven away by them.’  Go!  I tell you!  Go to all peoples as far as the boundaries of the world.  So that All My Doctrine and My Only Church may be made known and souls may be able to become part of It.”"

They are vultures and are merely preparing to feast on the retarded sheep that white countries have degraded to being.

If we regain our former strength and virility - Islam will not be a problem."
"Yep. I thought it was a Serbian nationalist that did it.

Death to Weimerica.

"
Conservatism 101: Never hold your politicians accountable - or the dems will win!
These new variations really convey the “values” of the ideology of “compassionate conservatism”.
"It's just 4d chess goy.

Nothin to see here. You just put on your red hat and drift off to sleep.

It won't hurt....much."
"If this world doesn't change soon - I'll consider starting a doomsday cult.

The end is nigh.

476 all over again."
"Soros is a Jew that pretended not to be to avoid getting shot.

This would explain his hatred for whites and white identity in the future.

Do you boomer types even try to think this through?

How anyone can seriously believe Soros was a white nationalist/fascist/natsoc is beyond me."

"I never knew it before getting redpilled but...90% of the American generals/politicians involved in the bombing of Serbia were...well you know who...

Cohencidence as always."
"Guns are only useful if you intend to use them.

Waving them around and LARPing 1776 is silly and isn't impressing anyone."
"Yeah no idea what happened there.

Could've been a pissed off Serb. Wouldn't blame him. But hard to tell at this point.

I'd be surprised if it was an Albanian, as they adore Weimerica. But who knows."
"I'd like to extend a warm welcome to the fresh batch of Twitter refugees who are coming to Gab as a result of the latest purge of right wing voices. You'll notice that there's a lot of unapologetic racism here, and that might be a little weird at first since you've become accustomed to Jews censoring you. Don't worry though, once your antiracist whining goes without the slightest bit of support, you'll realize that racism is cool."
"Neoliberal capitalism is probably the first Western ideology that didn't have hating Jews as its core principle. So yeah, you can be flexible hah."
"My go-to song when drinking.

"AfD is Now the Second Largest Party in Germany

Good to see that Petry was absolutely wrong about their need to be more moderate, a common modern female perspective.

"
"I think you misunderstood my intent.

I did not refer to persecuting Rodnovers. My primary ideology is tribal nationalism, not Christianity. The latter is merely a part of the former.

In my eyes the only difference between us is that you call our common Serbian God by a different name. I doubt our beliefs differ much beyond that."
"I do feel bad for black people, watching the way they are so excited about this Black Panther film. 

It's like, wow. Your whole identity and sense of self-worth is based on this Jewish science fiction movie. 

That is heavy. 

If it wasn't for Jews, blacks would just be a silly jungle curiosity."
"Jews Welcomed the Ottoman Conquest of Christendom

Imajun my shawke. Jews actively work to subvert their Christian host societies.

"
"They are still a part of the ethnic heritage of the country. Of course you can't force people to learn them, but you should provide these ethnic minorities or geographical groups all the resources needed to maintain them.

That's actual diversity worth preserving.

That said, they should also learn the official language of the nation, Spanish in this case."
"Not even a question to me.

Forsaking the language of your ancestors is a vile and despicable thing to do.

I imagine for a Spaniard especially it would be a slap in the face to turn to English, as it would be for me to turn to German or Turkish."
"If you are simply mindlessly hating on these Moslems, then you're falling into the trap. Stay focused. These people belong back in their own countries. Of course we should hate them for being here and doing the things they do but we should also not lose sight of who it is that brought them here in the first place. 

Grandpa Lampshade"
"People who are proudly anti-racist till the day they get raped/killed/etc by diversity should not be given a second glance.

They deserve whatever fate befalls them.

No compassion for traitors."
"Below 10% vote: Mention every speech. Love above all else.

Won him the election: Literally not mention once, except to disavow.

"Most of them are sick weirdos, boomers and degenerates.

In retrospect - hardly distinguishable from leftist liberals."
"All it would take for Trump to earn undying loyalty from his fanbase is to mention White Americans as a group.

Just once. Even alongside all his other cherished ""based"" minorities.

But he won't. That's how low white identity is placed in Weimerica.

Not worth even acknowledging."
"The AltLite mocks the leftist explanations and excuses for Islam, gun ownership and failed social policies....and yet proceed to make the exact same excuses when you mention racial patterns.

It's rather bizarre to observe happening in mere moments apart from each other."
"Foreign meddling in American politics is bad! Except when israelis do it. Like, constantly, year after year, decade after decade. Strange!"

"There is nothing wrong with applying one set of principles to your people and another to everyone else.

I will forgive my brother things for which I'd throw my enemy through a closed window.

Equally I will see good in the acts of my ancestors regardless of their actions, for they redeemed their sins by giving me life."
"Like in Horatius : ""To every man upon this earth
Death cometh soon or late.
And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds,
For the ashes of his fathers,
And the temples of his Gods."""
"To simple minds being pro-Palestine is equal to wanting muslims in your house.

The enemy of your enemy is at the very least an asset, if not a potential ally."
"People who think democratic elections will save the West....are very naive...to put it kindly.

This civilization is dying. It will not be saved.

The only question is whether our people will survive it. And that has nothing to do with optics."
"RIGHT - WING FAKERS, SCAM ARTISTS , AGENTS ...AND PERVERTS!"
"A lion pride that allows its weak to lead, its incompetent to survive and its lazy to thrive - will die.

The males will be killed and the females enslaved.

Such is the future of all who would go against the laws of nature."
"A true believer must persecute heresy. He must hate those who oppose his beliefs.

Anything else is a betrayal of his ideals and ultimate proof that he never held them in the first place."
Nihilism and blind tolerance are the polar opposites of everything that is holy and good in this world.
Happy Saturday from #Serbia
"Facts aren't racist, but they induce racism in people who accept them as true."
"Exactly.

If you're afraid of that label - you have no place in identity politics. That is my view.

Be honest."
"If I got a nickel every time a white person said: ""I'm not racist, but...*insert totally racist fact*"" - I could buy a plantation."
The problem with today's generation.
"Constitutionalism is a political religion in the US.

Not a very good one though.

"Because it's not unlikely that Trump might surrender to this act of war.

I assume a lot of people are getting ready to adjust to it and go: ""oh well, at least it wasn't Hillary"".

And so the wheel of liberalism spins onward into the abyss."
