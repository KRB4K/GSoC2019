consider the following:

2. She and Brian fought with Ding Dong and Julian on Twitter over a game that her husband didn't even make. they eventually stopped recording at the office, which probably sucked to Ross considering how much he was good friends with Oney to the point where he copied his humor, and the way he talked. 


3. remember when Holly and Suzy used to record together? and suddenly Suzy was never on her show again? and they all stopped playing monster hunter, WoW, and all the co-op games with Suzy? not to put salt in the wound, but I can see why Holly wanted to leave LA.

The other thing to consider is the type of fandom a show inspires. With something like Harry Potter, Anime, etc, I think everyone will agree there is less depth to the material, which leave more room for creating your own content.

With something like the sopranos, people are less inclined to create their own content because the content that exists is almost perfect. There is little for the community to improve upon. So instead we focus on analyzing and repeating the content."

The Rockefeller Foundation and the Aspen Institute have launched the Rockefeller Foundation-Aspen Institute Diaspora Program (RAD), a joint venture to better understand diaspora members’ financial and human capital investments and to design an approach to foster further growth in these areas. The Migration Policy Institute has partnered with RAD to produce profiles of 15 diaspora communities in the United States, which is home to nearly 60 million first- or second-generation immigrants.

Si estudiás en una universidad pública es evidente que muchos de estos problemas solo se resuelven elevando reclamos al centro de estudiantes porque los departamentos docentes ni la burocracia están interesados en los mismos. 

En Exactas uno de los reclamos que se hicieron era solicitar a los docentes de ciertas materias que guarden los resultados de los TPs, porque ciertas materias son tan infernales que es literalmente _imposible_ estudiar bien para los parciales y hacer los TPs simultáneamente.

This is being a sole trader - you trade under your own name and include your freelance income in your tax return.

&gt; Will I need business bank accounts? 

Not necessarily, but it can be nice for organization to keep things a little separate from your personal transactions. I just have a special personal account that I use for business purposes to make accounting easier.

&gt;What kind of things are GST exempt? I assume Web hosting fees, along with tools, etc would all be tax exempt but best to check.

This is a pretty ambiguous question - do you mean exempt such that you don't have to charge GST to your customers? or exempt such that you won't pay GST on them?

hardly anything is GST exempt. Exported services are not exempt, but are zero-rated - i.e if your customers are overseas, you charge them GST at 0% - so nothing - but still need to include it in your GST return.

as for GST exempt expenses - you won't pay GST on those services if they are overseas retailers and not set up to charge GST. AWS, for example, will not charge GST if you are registered and provide your IRD/GST number.

For domestic expenses, you will still pay GST on expenses, but then you will get it back when you file a GST return ."

I assume marriage has been or was a thought with him. Could you imagine dealing with this for the rest of your life? Not just the arguing, but that fact he doesn't communicate at all with you or finds you worthwhile enough to make real long lasting change?

You need to be with someone who more than anything, though, can communicate. That is the vital key to any relationship.

I can't imagine how hard it'd be to be in your situation. Of course you love him, you spent four years together and probably had planned some type of future.

"One Spark is definitely worth it and a decent reason on their own to do an early Proving Ground.

In the early game, they're extremely powerful.  You get high damage, high mobility, high aim (via jumping to a roof), a very early heavy weapon, immunity to nearly every special status, and they don't need to use up any of the often-limited cover.

Their usefulness trails off as the campaign progresses.  Meatbag stat growth and generally-better abilities make them far more powerful at the Maj/Col level, but a Spark still has decent late-game utility, even if just as a strategic reserve; once they have the Repair ability, they never have any downtime between missions.

As the early game is where the game's difficulty curve lies, something that's strong early but tails off later is entirely viable.  Contrast this with psi ops, who are gods late-game, but are such a huge early investment for such delayed payoff that they're not really  useful on Legend.

Sparks do get expensive.  Their armor and weapon upgrades are very high cost for something you'll only ever have one or maybe two units of, but that's offset by how high of a percentage of your missions they can go on.

Also, there's a risk element: if you ever lose your first Spark, it's nearly unrecoverable, since you can't get another except by ranking up a fresh one, and they level up very slowly."

"All the years following them and the integrity (I feel) they have shown just from not fully taking advantage of their position as the 2 privileged, white, physically fit &amp; attractive guys on the internet that they are (lbr)...

Now it's a constant guessing game of ""Will my second pet summon? Will it dismiss or just drag a mob back to my feigned corpse so I can die from aoe? Oh, it did camouflage with-- oh no, it fell out of camouflage""

It 100% does not obey feign death like Hati did, so if I get overwhelmed I can feign, my main pet feigns, and then we have to wait forever for the second pet to get its ass kicked before combat drops.

* I would say there's a hard limitation on how much Deorum a person can consume before their body gives in (heart attack?  Organ failure?  I haven't decided on that yet)
* I haven't decided on alternatives per say, but I have a 'plot twist' in the back of my mind where the end of the story would reveal that this city-state is considered a hostile terrorist nation by surrounding countries/cities.  Their unregulated use of this technology has led them to become an existential threat to neighboring sovereign nation.
* All I've come up with as of right now are the slow, methodical meditation of the monks and the brutal, direct approach of the inquisitors.  I was considering having my main character acquire some Deorum illegally and figure out a way to utilize it.
* That's a good question.  I haven't considered dependencies, but that could add a whole new layer to the system.  I'll revisit this.
* I haven't considered the exact amounts for each level of use (diluted amounts for monks vs. raw Deorum for inquisitors), but I will probably rethink this at some point.  I know for sure that there will be a lethal amount based on the subject's height, weight, etc.

Thanks for the input!"

"I'd recommend experimenting with alternating first player.  Sure, FFG has ""reasons"" not to do it, but why not give it a try?

For scoring, I plan to use a really complicated system, honestly.  Players will report remaining hit points on all their ships.  Opposing players will be granted MoV in terms of TL points destroyed, where each TL point corresponds to a number of hit points removed from the ship by

&gt; Points killed = (HP removed) * (Total ship TL points) / (total ship HP)

It's not the only fair way, but I find it satisfying.  I plan on doing the calculation myself at the end anyway so it shouldn't be overly complicated for the players.

"Word of advice:

ALWAYS get the fill plug out FIRST so you know it comes out. If you drain the fluid out you have no way to put it back in if the fill plug is rusted in place...

Then carefully remove all the bolts leaving top 2 in place and backed out  only a few turns. Start at the bottom bolts and work your way around up the sides. Have a pan ready as it will eventually drain out.

&amp;#x200B;

Once it slows then remove the rest - Be careful of the brake lines GM and thier dumbass ways run right behind the cover.

&amp;#x200B;

Use a putty knife and scrape the old RTV (gasket maker) and possibly a paper gasket off both the cover and differential side.

&amp;#x200B;

Carefully wipe out the bottom of the diff looking for any sparkles or chunks.(bad news)

&amp;#x200B;

I prefer to wipe the gasket surfaces with acetone to remove all the residual oil.

&amp;#x200B;

I use the black RTV and a new paper gasket (if available). Make sure you draw a bead of RTV around each bolt hole on the cover so it looks like a buncha fruit loops on a string. Carefully align it and start putting the bolts in place. Snug them up in a criss cross pattern and I prefer to wait 24 hours for the RTV to dry before refilling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Make absolutely sure you get the correct fluid and correct weight - some GM limited slips require an additive package or it will fail in short order.

3. What are the most frequent and/or most valuable types of touchpoints that you have with your various partners?

"Kinda weird you kept me in your head for so long, but alright. I assume you want a response out of me, so here it is.

Do I think that this video is him &amp; fucked up? Yes. However, I am going to continue to listen to and enjoy his music. 

I don't think X's actions were ever good, and I never said 100% that he wasn't guilty. All I've said is that there is more to the story behind all of the allegations than any of us know. There's the call with Geneva and her friends with X of her saying he didn't do anything, then there's this. 

I think with the stabbing it was a matter of self defense when being jumped. I don't think bragging about it is right but if you watch the video in relation to the incident of the stabbing, he's literally surrounded by people as some of them say ""Oh they gon jump!"" and X pulls the knife out. I think that's an appropriate response when being jumped tbh.

Regarding Geneva, yeah that's fucked. Domestic abuse is terrible and I feel bad for Geneva for the most part. However, I don't think it's right how much she lied in this case like about being pregnant.

I think that X had a really fucked up life full of neglect &amp; pain &amp; violence in a really bad environment, and he never learned how to express that without hurting others. I do think his actions were very very fucked up, but I see the story behind X. 

I'll continue to listen to his music and enjoy it. I won't agree with his actions and never will, but I will understand. I don't think it's right to say X wasn't trying to change either though. After he began gaining influence, you could tell he was really making change. He was overall making himself more kind &amp; understanding, and was doing things to give back to the world. We can't hate someone forever over incidents that had a lot of things behind them that the person regrets."

We were talking about how unreasonable it is to build houses in a location like that, it's basically just a sand bank after all. A few weeks ago when Hurricane Michael passed over exactly that area, I was curious to find out how the peninsula fared and even though I've seen worse hurricane damage to houses, the main road on the peninsula was completely fucked up beyond all recognition ([helicopter footage](https://youtu.be/UI2T-PYYifE)).

He reported that he emailed our general email line and was informed by one of our staff that the upcoming Women’s Beer Forum was for ‘women only.’ He then proceeded to demand thousands of dollars from us, while also threatening a discrimination complaint through the government if we refused to pay. Since he had never purchased admission through our online sales portal, we were unaware about his request to attend the Women’s Beer Forum. We apologized about the miscommunication and offered him an opportunity to learn about the same flight of beers provided at the event for the same ticket price.

"&gt;Where is the line between objective meaning and emotional meaning?

There isn't a line, because existential nihilism suggests that meaning doesn't exist in the first place. There cannot be a line between two things if those things don't exist.

&gt;What makes something more meaningful than another if we decide what has meaning?

What makes a chair a chair? It is decided by the fact that we call it a chair. Are you a chair if I call you a chair? Are you a chair in every iteration, at every point of the universe if I call you a chair? No. You are only a chair from my singular perspective of your being. To you and to others, you aren't a chair. To the sun and the moon you aren't a chair. To the galaxy and beyond, you aren't a chair. Two minutes from now, you aren't a chair, either. Only to me, in this moment are you a chair. I apply the same sort of logic to meaning. Meaning would have to be applied to the universe in every iteration, at every point, in every moment it exists for it to be purposeful. 


&gt;The purpose will allow you to look back when your life is coming to an end

So you agree that your purpose is implying an end. An end which is, by your own words to, ""be satisfied with your small slice of existence""? There's a reason we often use the phrase, ""means to an end."" It is because those two things, meaning and ends, have a direct correlation to each other, should we suppose that meanings or endings exist.

&gt;You can choose to look at things completely objectively and choose to not move forward in life because ""what's the point?"" but then you'll just end up miserable and defeated. 

Who's to say a nihilist must look at things objectively and choose not to move forward in their lives? "

"While I agree that approach is short-sighted, let's make no mistake the tactics are not the same.

There is more evidence the subversive and increasingly fascist content that has been posted online is from an increasingly smaller minority of shit stirrers who's connections to Russian state media has already been confirmed on reddit, facebook, twitter et al. In addition, bots, shilling, dog-whistles, robocalls, memes, hacking, ddos attacks etc are all the bread and butter of conservatives and their international ilk. How could you tell you were being dehumanized instead of just being recognized for laying down with dogs? So instead of being introspective what do they do? They make yet another pointless meme that applies more to yourselves than the people you criticize, and can't let it go long enough to even make a serious rebuttal to justify the difference (which just makes it look like you cannot, or more likely that you in particular are just butthurt.)

The ratios are weird insofar as they are dependent on multiple variables. This is annoying, especially if you are not a math person. (AKA, don't feel bad, they *are* a pain to calculate as simple equations.)

"Justement le budget prévoie pour 2019 de transformer le CICE (une réduc d'impôt sur les sociétés, basée sur l'emploi, usine à gaz bien franco-française) en baisses de charges sur les bas salaires, ce qui va clairement dans le bon sens. 

&gt; A titre personnel, je suis pour que l'on bazarde notre système corporatiste de financement par cotisations pour le remplacer par un système universel de financement par l'impôt.

En théorie ça parait logique, en pratique ça me semble difficile à faire : sur un salaire superbrut médian (~3000 €) tu as facilement 50% de cotisations. Du coup ça reviendrait à doubler les salaires net (cool !) et faire un impôt sur le revenu avec une tranche moyenne autour de 60% (pas cool !), ce qui a mon avis poserait des soucis de concurrence fiscale avec le reste de l'Europe.

Par contre Macron a déjà sorti certains financement des cotisations vers l'impôt, et puis la CSG fait aussi ça depuis un moment."

"If God is omniscient, then God knows exactly what world He would create that would allow for a maximum exercise of free will. I am talking about the natural composition of the world now; basically the other things that God created in those six days. Even further God would know of the kind of world that would need be created to allow mankind to wholly and invariably exercise their free will.

If God chose what to create based off of what would allow for maximum free will, rather than which free will decisions would be made, how then would God be dictating the free will decisions of anybody? Even if God did not do this, but instilled mankind with free will that operates true to the person it is attached to regardless of the created world, mankind would still have free will.

You are locking God in a box, where you demand that if God created the universe that He therefore be incapable of giving free will to humanity. But again, you have not demonstrated why this is necessarily the case."

"Hello, I have some perspective from the 'other side' of this issue. I had 7 ultrasounds throughout my pregnancy, all looked 100% perfect and low-risk and my baby was born with Down Syndrome anyway. 

Looking back it was silly to decline the blood testing (NIPT) for the $500 it would have cost - my doctor said I was so low risk it wouldn't be worth it. If it would make a difference for you, and I see you commented that you wouldn't be able to cope with a baby with DS, I would recommend the blood test. I'm not sure which country you are in, but our baby was in the neonatal intensive care unit for a month despite being very healthy for having DS, which would have bankrupted us if we didn't live in a country with free healthcare.  

For further background info I was 31 when my baby was born, and no family history of any genetic conditions at all. 

Hope that helps and best of luck to you and your wife"

"Nope. Merely observing that our tedious national fixation on some wonderful bygone age is detrimental. Cultures evolve over time and you either adapt or become moribund and irrelevant.

All the hurf, durf, immigration shite wilfully glosses over the fact that, as a nation, we've actively encouraged immigration post-war - Windrush being a single example - and that, as a maritime nation it has always been unavoidable and often down to our own callous indifference. The East India company would often refuse return passage for Indian sailors, for example, stranding them here. Small numbers, granted, but that's how it starts.

But then I don't know, maybe people are still whining about the 50,000 Hugenots invited over by Charles II, or the 300,000-odd Germans that've turned up since 1945. Maybe, to a certain extent, they've got a point. 

But perhaps, and this is solely my personal opinion, some of those people should have at least a rough idea of what the past actually constituted beyond the vague idea that it was just better and it's all those different people's fault that it no longer is. 

Are things great now? No, obviously. But they weren't great then either, just differently shit. Give it another 50 years and people'll probably be banging on about how great things were now as though they'd have any fucking clue at all.

It will take time, people need to understand that the science and evidence isn't there for the medical claims, they also need to be honest that they just want access.

Not sure why everyone wants a satellite campus. Out here in Burlington we have a degroote business school from McMaster. They run buses all day between the two locations. Why wouldn’t they just stick it on the Mac campus? Someone getting some kickbacks here? Hey McMac put a building here- we will give you some free land and bags of money to do it...
Why is that a problem? Maybe you should get mad at the city/county/state for not permitting the building of more housing.

"NTA. I wouldn’t call you an asshole or a douche, but whoever told you that it could be making people uncomfortable is right. I’m a pretty outgoing person but this would make me pretty uncomfortable. Besides the uncomfortable factor, it comes off as not genuine. “Hey I’m John Smith, you don’t know me, let’s go on a date” seems very impersonal, like you just go up to any person of your sexual preference and ask them out like a dime a dozen. Not that I think it should be some huge serious choice to ask someone out, but there’s not even conversation/very minimal conversation there to connect with this person beforehand.

 If you have problems at hitting Andro in punch-distance, the issue is probably that your aim is crap. It’s hiper short range, not even short range since even lex has the double of distance before getting damage falloff, you can’t miss from that distance. The problem it had was how forgiving it was with players with bad aim and how it turned everyone into crap in non-high elos. However, if you see any pro player gameplay, none of them spam the punch, and they only use it to get a burst at finishing of kills. His revolver had way higher dps and you have no reason to spam punch over using the revolver if you can hit the shots. The punch-spamming was a noobtrap as well as skye is, the thing is that the noobtrap actually extended to medium elo too."

"I have cable. We pay $150 a month right now. That's cable, internet, and phone. $30 is taxes. Of that remaining $120, it's $60 for internet and $15 for phone. That means $45 is cable, right? But I get the bundle discounts. So if I cancel cable while keeping the other services, that becomes $80 for internet and $35 for phone. Which means really I'm paying $5 for cable. And of course this all begs the question: Why the hell do you have a land line in this day and age, to which I reply: My home security system is $40 a month cheaper if I use a land line instead of cell service.

It's a bit of an annoyance, but waiting a few seconds longer to give the second wake word and command seems to prevent the issue from occurring.

Edit: After some more experimentation this morning, I removed the statement about the follow-up mode seeming to extend past the time that the follow-up indicator light goes out.

"Your metaphor is confusing, because the iPhone did, in fact (once again), change the industry. Not to mention you’re comparing apples and oranges.

Your last remark pretty much embodies my original comment: you weren’t paying attention. You keep oversimplifying it. You focus on one thing, and fail to see the numerous things that the iPhone did that set it apart. No one is saying they invented the touchscreen, or even that it was the first in a smartphone. But it was first that combined the touch screen, the gestures, the web browser, the large screen, the lack of physical keys, and the best-in-class experience into a single device.

My remark about manufactures rethinking their phones was primarily directed at Google’s early Android efforts, where they had to go [back to the drawing board](https://bgr.com/2013/12/19/original-iphone-android-story/).

It’s evident here that you’ve crafted your own version of the events that took place a decade ago. I’ve tried to wrap my head around it, but I guess I’ll have to chalk it up to “fanboi nonsense.” At any rate, this is going nowhere. Believe what you will, I’m out of patience. Good night. 👋🏻"

"Layers is the ultimate key! Most of the winter(from -5C to -15C) I wear jeans with couple of woolen pantyhoses/leggings under them and a tank top plus a warm sweater with a small neckline.

For jackets - woolen trench coat for over -15C, parka when it gets colder/windy.

Nothing beats knitted mittens for gloves (well, leather mittens with fur/sheep wool inside do if it's super cold). I don't really use beanies if hell isn't freezing over. If I have something to cover my ears (usually it's headphones) I'm just fine with a hood over my head.

All in all, invest in a really good jacket and a pair of shoes and you'll be just fine. Greetings from the Nordic countries!"

"&gt;ethics and decency is right. an ideology for one group of people is wrong. ethics must remain implicit. if one makes it explicit, it is hypocrisy. 

Fuck that, you just made it explicit and therefore by your admission hypocritical.

&gt;the fixation on the idea that women must quickly reach 50% rates in male-dominated areas is merely an idea, not a necessary let alone good goal.

A simple message to correct a complicated reality. If it reaches and maintains at 30% then that is improvement.

&gt;if you see modern society, everybody is studying until 27, then one wants to do many things, and at 36 one adorns oneself with one child. 

A vast overstatement. Most college graduates graduate by 22. Graduate students may study later if they choose, but this decision is theirs to make.

&gt;That is an unnatural and immature way to live one's life, and it destroys society. 

You know what else is unnatural? Air conditioning. Indoor plumbing. Currency. Language. Religion. Getting somewhere without walking there.

Humans excel because we're nature's way of inventing new ways to do things in a way that's not random chance.

My takeaway from this conversation is that you're cynical because you're anxious and afraid. If you don't mind, I'd like to invite you to do a few things.

First, I want you to take a couple of deep breaths. You are a valuable person in society, and you are loved.

Second, I want you to let go of the conviction that women are lesser. Try to keep an open mind for a week or two. Have a strictly friendly conversation with a woman if you can. Perhaps an older one at a nursing home or something.

Third, I want you to seek professional help. It's not a terrible thing, and your college likely has free therapy options available. The mind is like a dark attic, and therapy can help you turn on a light."

"You don't need to charge through a horde to do that in the first place, maybe in VERY select scenarios/levels. I have used the dash to get closer to specials to melee-kill them.

Many ranged weapons are capable of sniping specials in or behind a horde, as long as (like I said) you are not playing alone.

The handguns and crossbows in the game are more than capable of performing this task, so is/was the fireball staff.

You can still perform your described scenario even without the camo, as you stagger every enemy that you dash through, giving you a window for a quick shot.

The only thing I have used the camo for as a ""benefit"" was to get behind CW's or shielded stormvermin, but that works out quite poorly. And you are fucking your teammate with that move since all the elites switch target to them immediately. "

"Rodger's murders 100% have a racial motive that he outlines in his manifesto. His first victim was one of his former roommates, whom he stabbed 94 times. 

In his manifesto, he states that his idea of taking out his revenge in the form of murder first spawned when he learned that his asian roommate had sex with a white woman. This caused him to break down, sob, call his mom and then move out immediately.

He spends pages whining about how inferior races do not deserve to have sex with white women, and white women don't deserve to live if they choose to have sex with other races and not him."

After I had a couple of those projects under my belt, I looked for jobs that fitted my skillset. Now I work as a software engineer developing similar projects as the projects I had under my belt when I applied for this job."
The criticism has to do with Demps.  Honestly AD’s career hasn’t been relevant up to this point and we’ve only seen him in the playoffs a few short series.  A large part of that is the poor drafting and rebuilding of the Pelicans outside of Davis.  It really doesn’t look like the Pelicans can put together a real contender any time soon anyway.  Despite their hot start I am not sure a team starting Eldridge Payton at PG and E’twaun Moore at SF is getting home court in the West.

"Hi there! I have severe OCD also and am in treatment for it, so I wanted to share my support - it's a heinous illness. I also wanted to let you know something that really surprised me but has helped me very much to learn: making this post was an OCD behavior. You know that is not how calories work, so the point of this post is not to gather information, but to seek reassurance.

From the r/ocd subreddit:  
""\[Posting here to seek\] reassurance is a compulsion to confirm that one's obsession is or isn't a real threat, or that compulsions should or shouldn't be followed through on. Providing this reassurance actually strengthens the obsession by validating it. Instead, please support others through more constructive means. ""

I hope this reply doesn't invalidate you or upset you in any way - I know you're already feeling bad, and I've been there. But now that I'm finally getting effective treatment after suffering for 20 years or more, basically my whole life, I wanted to share something about how OCD works that's helped me understand why my intrusive thoughts make me feel like I need to respond in certain ways.

"FTR I hate Trump, can't stand Trumpets, I'm proudly banned from /r/The_Donald, and I can't stand Alex Jones or Prison Planet. 

That being said, the more I learn about this whole thing the more out looks like a hoax. I feel wrong just saying that but so many things don't add up. 

None of the bombs are actually functional, they weren't actually made to blow up. 

I have seen a half dozen self-professed bomb disposal experts on Twitter, current and former, explain how silly these things look. All of them explained that the 2 wires shouldn't be going to opposite ends of each other. All of these people are saying they're made for show and not for actual explosions.  

Furthermore, none of the envelopes used to deliver the ""bombs"" have [post office ink stamps](https://www.google.com/search?q=post+office+ink+stamp&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK-qGtp6DeAhXOjVkKHbIUDzgQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=983) on them. The stamps are all clean. That, to me, seems to indicate that the envelopes weren't posted but were carried to destination.

Plus, why put these things in tiny/skimpy little envelopes? Wouldn't you want to disguise them a little into some sort of package? Anyone can figure out that these envelopes are super sketchy just by holding them in one's hand... You could feel the wires through the damn envelop. 

So we're supposed to believe that someone was smart enough and motivated enough to find the addresses of all these people and ship them all these stupidly made fake bombs for no other reason than to ""spook"" the ""globalist round earth shill libtards""? This or these people should have known full well that this incident would be blamed on Trump's tribe, thus potentially harming the Republican cause. 

So what's the point??? 

The bombs blow up, Trump/Republicans get blamed, probably harms their midterm chances. Bombs are fakes, Trump/Republicans still get blamed, probably harms their midterm chances. 

The only people who stand to gain anything from this whole drama is the Democrats. That's it. 

I hate to side with the Trumptards but my Spidey Sense hasn't stopped going bananas since this whole thing started. 

I actually think this whole thing was orchestrated by an interest group who is desperate to see the Dems win the midterms.

"I like Maven. It’s good enough that it made me cancel my zipcar membership. Cars start at like $7/hr or $70 per day, though the cheapest cars are reserved a few days ahead of time, so you may want to book early. I rent a car 20-25 times a year and it’s entirely on Maven now. It’s owned and operated by GM. I’ve had issues with 2-3 rentals (car suddenly unavailable at last minute, etc) and each time they adequately took care of me — switching me to a nicer car, etc. gas and insurance are included. 

Promo Code: DYLAN6561 will get both of us $15 off our next trip. 


Another option is Getaround. You’re renting regular peoples cars, but you can actually do it through Uber now. Can’t really vouch for it because I haven’t used it myself yet. 

If you’re going for more then a day or two, traditional car rentals are definitely an option. You don’t need to go to the airport either. There are a number of branches around the city, Enterprise is my go to for longer term rentals, and if you call them they will pick you up. "

"Can confirm. Became unemployed with a dog and knowing that I was responsible for him I did what I had to do to get back on track. Being a contractor I hadn't gone on vacation/holiday for years. He was happy as can be having me around all the time, and I had 6 months worth of unemployment benefits so I decided that the first three months were going to be my long overdue holiday, and that I wouldn't even make an attempt to look for work. Got back in shape and became healthier going on longer and and more prolonged walks, and since I was super budgeting I was also eating a lot less. At the three month mark I was ready to ""take on the world"" again. It did take me the entire next three more months to find a job but it was the job that got my foot in the door for that company for the next 8 years. They were very stressful months but also they were very happy months. We got through it together, my buddy and I. Can't even imagine how that would've gone without him by my side.

"Do we have any primary sources of the events? AFAIK the earliest New Testament books weren't written for at least 40 years after. The Dead Sea scrolls demonstrate the reliability of the duplication of the texts, but say nothing about whether they were right to begin with

I haven't heard about evidence through disciples, so a source would be nice. But that still doesn't demonstrate miracles

However, I'm skeptical to believe the accounts of ancient people on supernatural phenomena during a time where most everything was supernatural. It seems very plausible that somebody created the story and it spread without fact checking. By the time anyone bothered, it was a big movement"

"My husband and I have been looking for a second dog for our Chico boy for a week or two. He is very rambunctious and we want someone who can keep up with him. 

We first went to a lab rescue and found a boy who was super strong. Right size. Good boy. They got along eh ok. We could’ve made it work but the dog just wasn’t into us. I know there was a lot going on but we just felt no connection with him and decided to pass. 

Second dog we met was a puppy only six months. But was German Shepard and would’ve been plenty big for our boy. Only this puppy was terrified of being at the shelter and then split up from litter mates. She sat and cowered in the corner as my dog was super excited to play. She was so precious and if we were looking for an only dog, or had more time to devote to her then we would’ve picked her una heart beAt but alas it wasn’t a good match and passed on her too. 

While walking to her kennel we saw this super goofy tall and wiggly lab named star. I said to my husband we should really see her. She’s same age as our Chico and just the right size. Loves to play and while she was super interested in our dog she was also super into us. I immediately knew she was the one. We were taking her home. You just felt that connection, even the dogs had it. They were made for each other. And while the other two dogs would’ve probably been ok there just wasn’t that chemistry we were looking for. When we met star we just knew!"

"My experience with gay men is that if you're looking to get to know someone and date him first, it's almost nonexistent, and second, if you get to the second date and don't have sex, there probably won't be a third date. (And if you get to the second date and he doesn't make an *attempt* to get you in bed, he's not really interested, so I'd dump him.) 

My perspective on gay dating is that you meet a hot guy, have sex with him, and if it's good enough that you both want a second time around you do that, and by that point you can be talking and see if dating is something you might both be interested in. In some cases you meet for coffee or somesuch before the first sex, but that's really more of ""I just want to see him so I know before I'm committed if I want to get in bed with him"" than a *date*, as such.

I don’t think I could provide the structure daycare could. And I’m an extreme introvert so I know I’d never be able to give them the socialization a daycare would.

This whole situation is just a giant indictment on their marketing abilities. They have one marketing tool and they never expand on it. Every fighter is different and will appeal to different types of people. This gives an opportunity to expand into new markets with every fighter they promote. You need to adjust your strategies to these new markets. Instead they promote to the same people every time using the same tools.nit greatly limits their appeal.

"*'Taylor Swift - This Is Our Song'*

A huge, coffee table book loaded with interviews, articles, reviews, fan-opinions, and generally, lots of stuff related to her.

A biography from her early days in Nashville, all the way through to *'1989'*.

Its full OP/EDs, thinkpieces, articles, and interviews from all around.

If you can get past the price (Hefty Book, equally hefty price), I'd recommend it for all fans.  It's a treasure trove of Swifty-Goodness.

But the belief that there is a higher power, maybe gives them some comfort and something to blame on or use as an excuse during their hardest times of life.

##If you found the image somewhere:

Please note that we require you to post the [**complete original source article**](https://redd.it/2lokun), so that the readers can get context, the author can get credit, and third parties don't get hits from stealing another person's work. Posts must directly link to the visualization **where it was originally introduced** by the author (not an image on the site, but **the actual full web page article**). [More information here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_original_sources).

The source is rarely Gawker, Tumblr, Imgur, etc. Figure out where *they* got it. Usually a link to the original source is in the first couple paragraphs of where you found it. You may wish to try [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/) or [Reverse Google Images](https://images.google.com/). If you need assistance, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful&amp;subject=Need+help+finding+the+original+source&amp;message=I+need+help+finding+the+original+source+of+this+image:+https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/9r5gnl/magabomber_and_falseflag_twitter_datasets_combined/).

##If you're trying to make a crosspost

**...and** the author of the reddit post is the **original author** of that visual (i.e. you've checked *thoroughly* that the thread you are trying to link is the **first instance ever** of that visual):

1. Delete this current thread.
2. Copy the URL of the Reddit thread you are trying to crosspost.
3. [Go to the submission page](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/submit) and paste the URL of the thread.
4. You are now done. Sit back and reap the karma.

Note that this subreddit does not currently have crossposting enabled.

##If you are trying to submit a Wikipedia link:

Try submitting the *Wikipedia* or *Wikimedia commons* link instead of the raw file. A quick look at the URL should confirm this. Compare the following links:

* **Link A:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Minard%27s_Map_%28vectorized%29.svg
* **Link B:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization#/media/File:Minard%27s_Map_(vectorized).svg
* **Link C:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Minard%27s_Map_(vectorized).svg

Take a look at Link A. That is just the image, and is the same issue with hotlinking an article image from a website; there is no context. Now look at Link B. There is a lot of enriching information, e.g. copyright license, author, source, and even a link to the revision history. The same is the case with Link C. In the ideal case, **the B or C examples are the acceptable links.**

##If you made the image yourself:

...then you probably just forgot to add `[OC]` to the title. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Delete this current thread.
2. [Resubmit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/submit?sidebar&amp;title=Title%20your%20visualization%20but%20keep%20the%20closing%20tag%20%5BOC%5D#btn) your thread with the phrase `[OC]` somewhere in the title.
3. AutoModerator will send you a private message instructing you how to cite your post. **Follow instructions carefully.**
4. If you have done everything correctly, /u/OC-Bot will be along shortly to reward you with [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/flair#wiki_oc_flair), and sticky your citations.

"First off, I would definitely suggest getting Thanos, because he's an excellent tank for Raids as well as for the Cosmic and Mystic campaigns, and works especially well alongside the Guardians and other Cosmic characters (like Mordo and Loki) since he gives them Energy.   


Cap really works on just about any team; if you want you could replace Loki with Cap, since Cap's Defense Up will help with Spidey and Quake's longevity and the extra energy will sometimes let you fire off XBones' Aoe a turn sooner. Speaking of XBones, you should definitely level up his Aoe past 2 soon, it's extremely strong and is basically a win condition against certain teams. Also, Quake's Special should be a low priority; you're usually just going to want to spam Basics and fire off Ults with her anyway, there are other characters that can remove buffs so she doesn't have to stop slowing. As far as where to put Mordo, pairing him with Loki works well because their passives complement each other nicely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm no pro by any means, but if I were to construct teams with your roster +Thanos, Cap, and Mordo, I'd do this (teams listed in order from left to right):  
A) Defenders + Punisher  
B) Cap + Wolverine + Quake + Spidey + XBones  
C) Yondu + Thanos + Mordo + Gamora + Loki  


The B team is pretty straightforward, you've got Cap Taunting and giving Defense Up and energy and Quake slowing to ensure your team survives till Quake and XBones fire off their Ults. I put Wolverine next to Cap just so if there's adjacent damage or chains aimed at Cap's taunt, Wolvie gets hit instead of a more squishy character. You can play around with the placements on the C team, but whoever Thanos is next to will be given energy whenever an enemy dies. I like to put Mordo and Yondu next to him since Mordo's Blinds fire off faster and Yondu can both summon more and fire off AOE faster. "
"&gt; If that particular male student refused, then there would be other students available, so he is not at risk of failing the lab. Thus it is ""A male student"" and not ""The male student.""

"&gt;This country confiscates the resources of those who earn them

Aren't companies who earn the resources that are ""confiscated"" greatly benefiting from the society they live in, such as the schools that educated their workers, the roads that their workers take to get to work, etc...? Isn't it only fair that those who are made wealthy from the benefits the country provides them pay back into the system so others can flourish as they have? Paying taxes may seem abhorrent to people who want to hoard their wealth, but the fact is we live in a collective society and we have to act like it. Success for all of us is good for each of us as individuals. Even a guy like Jordan Peterson will tell you that if you don't help the poor, society will collapse. A truly healthy society should try to bring the most good to the most people, and you can't really do that without taxes and social programs. 

&gt;to prop up the birth rates of degenerates who will vote for the hand outs promised by leftists.

I think if you're going to make this assertion you would do well to provide some sources, because this seems like a mischaracterization, including: of how tax money is spent, how it affects ""birth rates"", and how people who receive government assistance vote. Exactly how much money is going to whom, and once they get it, how do they vote?

&gt;Many of these confiscated resources are funneled to tech firms via CIA glow in the dark funding to enable surveillance and manipulation

If you have reputable sources to support this it's super interesting and I'd like to see what this is all about.

&gt;schools staffed by leftists... for education of a worse quality than that of a century ago and which is filled with propaganda

I don't think it is any mystery or coincidence that educated people with an interest in helping others are both teachers and lean left. The left is the party that represents those qualities, it's no conspiracy or stacking the schools with leftists to support state propaganda. (Also, what propaganda would this be?) If anything, the right is MUCH more culpable for the decline of public school quality, since they constantly attack and make efforts to defund public education. And while I'll admit that public education could use a massive amount of improvement, I think we would be hard pressed to find any metric by which our current education system is worse than it was a century ago. How are public schools worse today than they were in 1918?

&gt;University professors produce almost no legitimate research and are merely fronts for Marxism.

I doubt very seriously you have anything to back this up. I think this is your gut feeling or something you were told and chose to believe. How can you possibly defend this?

&gt;many graduates of our public school system are completely unfit to add anything to the productive areas of society

Who defines the ""productive areas"" and how is this measured? Even if it's true, again, I don't see how you can say it's anyone but the right because they're the party that goes after education budgets. If you mean state colleges/public universities, again, I would like to see sources or employment statistics defending this claim. But even if you mean universities are churning out philosophy majors with no skills who end up unemployed, I don't know how that's conclusively attributable to a particular political affiliation. What has the left (communists, apparently) actively done to make school graduates avoid the ""productive areas of our society"" (whatever that is)?

&gt;The left wants to import people who cannot create a stable society because these same people support leftists. It is plain and clear.

What are you actually talking about here? Is this statement really as racist as it sounds? That you basically believe that the foreign others are savages who can't behave themselves in a civilized society?"

"My memory isn't that great, so I'll do my best. I'm also in the research stage still, but I feel like we always are. I'm also apologizing for the poor wording ahead of time or if I'm being cryptic or I ramble.

If I had to pinpoint a possible start, it was when I was a very little kid when I was very passionate about science and how I was always in such awe with the natural world around me. I felt at home under a starry sky or wandering the woods near me for acorns and pine cones; especially the former, and it inspired me to want to be an astronomer as my first dream career. It always disappointed me when those around me weren't as excited or passionate about nature like I was. 

Sometime after I ""renounced my Christian faith"", I started an on and off thing where I'd gravitate towards paganism as a topic of interest. I first heard about the basics of Wicca when I was about 12 or 13, and it never meshed with me because I couldn't connect to the idea of deity worship and the magical aspect of things. Despite this, I'd spend my free time looking at the religion side of Wikipedia to learn what I could - as well as other things relating to ancient history, like lost/dead languages and civilizations. I was largely drawn to the Roman and Hellenic pantheons, but specifically why I'm not sure. I know it was amplified more when I was taking Latin classes in high school, but beyond that it's non-specific. 

Within the past three to five years, I'd lurk on pagan blogs over on tumblr to learn more about what was becoming a growing interest for me. It was a great way to not only learn more, but also help me reevaluate my own beliefs which I've always had a hard time finding a complete name for. I was still grappling with my Satanic philosophy, but how in some regard I vibed with the idea of ""spiritual atheism"", but the militant and often obnoxiously arrogant side of the communities I was in made me feel more closed off to talk about my viewpoint. After interacting with a certain blog in particular, I felt more confident to ask the moderators questions about where they'd personally place me on the spectrum - or if I really was just an atheist that was trying to be ""special"". After being steered towards Humanistic Paganism, some of them said my view on deity sounded a lot like pantheism. [Here's the tl;dr version of that to save time](https://www.reddit.com/r/pantheism/comments/9h7s83/stuck_on_finding_a_name_for_myself_would_you_say/).

Since feeling like I've been coming into my own, I've felt drawn to looking into that pagan blog again, which is now on indefinite hiatus. It helped me feel more affirmed with my beliefs, but I feel it also gave me the encouragement or pull to explore the idea of deity more - even from the stance of soft polytheism. For whatever reason, I've had felt a strong pull from the Norse pantheon, and so far I feel like I'm on the right path. It's hard to describe, but when I think about the gods, I feel at home and safer; like Thor being that big brother who encourages me to stand up for myself and push myself out of my comfort zone or Frigga being that mom who would knit you a sweater with love in every stitch or you can have a relaxing chat with over some coffee. Y'know, that sort of thing. 

I'm still navigating and starting to work on tearing down the walls around me to allow me to be more open-minded to new experiences or ideas. I feel like this is something I can see myself to in the long run, but I guess I'm still nervous since this is new territory and I'm not sure when I should be able to ""declare"" myself a pagan or if it's a more personal and individual matter for me to decide."

"'Choir boy' looks to be the Chorus Kids, a trio of well singers, featured in one of the minigames in the Rhythm Heaven franchise, a far more recent franchise than you have heard, originating on the GBA in 2006, and having subsequent entries on the DS, Wii and 3DS, it's one of Nintendo's more notable newer franchises, and is relatively popular, with each installment having reasonable sales figures, the DS game being the most popular with around 3.2m according to VGChartz iirc. A character, notably Karate Joe and Chorus Kids, from the franchise has been fairly common in speculation due to evidence that one was cut from Smash 4's roster.

Your knowledge of Mach Rider seems fairly accurate, being a popular NES game back in '85, but having no follow up entries in the series. They're not a character that has been especially speculated by the community, likely being chosen for inclusion as a retro, or more obscure rep for this installment that Sakurai tends to like to include in these games (other examples of this would be G&amp;W, ROB, Duck Hunt)."
"i don't like them because they look so careless. like if you want to have an aesthetic that is daywear, these dont work because you can see the seams and excess plastic. for like trashy going out wear, i could see it working, but there are a lot of types of fun colorful cheap beads that arent temporary plastic and might have some workmanship to appreciate. this is like an item from an episode of what not to wear. also i dont mean trashy in a derogatory way but in like an intentional vibe kinda way."
"This is how I feel.   

I've replaced lights and stuff as they go bad but overall it's been the same every year.  
When I was a kid it was our tradition that every year we got a Christmas ornament as a present. So I have my ornaments from the 70s to adulthood.  Of course, everything is broken now and some missing. New ornaments I've bought since then are all breaking too.  
I have an artificial tree that broke down after years, so this year I finally bought a new one.  

I'm contemplating buying all new ornaments and ditching everything else... but there's still some sentimental value to some (even though they are broken) and some are still good (they just are a hodge podge of mismatched junk).  

It's really more stressful of a decision than it needs to be, I almost wish I could be like the people who but new stuff all the time. But that's just so wasteful in my mind.

"I think that what our friend u/tasteofItaly here is saying is that he may be nailing colors to his mast but he is always analyzing them and making sure they're correct. It's more of patriotism vs. nationalism if you want to go with flags and banners as our analogy. I personally have been waging this war inside my heart and head for a long time, and it seems to me that when I was an athiest/agnostic and always searched for truth and fact I began to discover over a long time that truth and fact in the human mind need not apply to truth and fact in God's mind, should he exist. Basically, making every decision about my faith from the articles and papers I read that others write based on their research that uses inaccurate-at-best sensors and tools and that generally must appeal to funding and suppress their shortcomings so as to not seem stupid or redundant is exhausting. It began to feel incredibly foolish and prideful to believe that I could have a sound understanding of the Universe as a simple human, especially when I'm not even the single most well-educated man on Earth. 

So then it boiled down to asking myself ""what truth makes sense to me and brings me peace,"" and after a long time I began to realize the hope offered by Christianity is what speaks to me. But I think another point our friend made is huge too: I don't let that give me a pedastool on which I can suppress others. Just because that is my current conclusion does not mean I need to blindly and naïvely (as foolishly and pridefully as I had followed my idea of living on big facts) follow it as a nationalistic coward who is afraid of challenging his own beliefs and is afraid of questioning himself or accepting such scrutiny from others. I simply invite it to be the lantern on the bow, guiding me and giving me the clarity in the darkest storms and helping to lead me through my life.

Hope this helps."
"If you're on a budget IronrockOffroad has some doetche tech shocks that run about $130 for 4. I don't have much info on stock leafs because I went right to a full traction long arm 4 link it with all new springs from ft.

For play in the steering the best is to have someone turn the wheel back and forth while you hold on to components and see if they have play. For example hold your hand on the trackbar joint and the trackbar mount. They shouldn't have play, then do the same with your tierods/knuckles they should move at the same time with no play. If the joints are tight, bushings are good, then look up the cure by ruff stuff. It helps eliminate the rolling in the tierods which can manifest as loose steering. 

Also is it play as in the steering wheel has room to move side to side a bit before the wheels move or does the Jeep wander while driving. First scenario is bad bushings/joint/worn box. If the latter check alignment especially castor, worn springs with weak swaybar may cause pronounced bump steer. 

Fuck full traction tho. Good products super shit customer service."

She just laid there, silent and gave no cues or hints. As soon as it was over, she just said, ""You did it wrong."" She rolled over and put her ass in the air and said, ""You were supposed to do it like this."" I was so turned off by the way she went about it that I wasn't down to go again.

TL:DR- Girl made no effort to communicate her desires and criticized me for not reading her mind."

"Hey everyone! Here's my original Grinch post that got removed. Sorry for my delayed responce, I was on a subway with no service for a while after I posted it. I

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;Every fan down in Smashville liked hype a lot…  
 But the Grinch, who lived somewhere in France, DID NOT!  
 The Grinch hated hype-ing! The whole pre-release season!  
 Now please don’t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.  
 

​

&gt;It could be he was sick of all the fake leaks.  
 It could be, perhaps, he could not wait 6 weeks.  
 But I think that the most likely reason of all,  
 Was he knew Verg’s roster was two sizes too small.  
 

​

&gt;Whatever the reason, the size or the wait,  
 He stood there on Wednesday, ready for hate.  
 Staring down at the banner with a sour, Grinchy frown,  
 At unreleased characters – shit’s about to go down.  
 

​

&gt;For he knew every fan down in Smashville online,  
 Were caught in a drought, just passing the time.  
 “And they’re talking about Skull Kid!” He snarled with a sneer,  
 “Next month is Ultimate! It’s practically here!”  
 

​

&gt;Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously humming,  
 “I must tell them somehow, they won’t see it coming!”  
 For each day he knew all the smash boys and smash girls,  
 Would cling to new leaks, it might make him hurl.  
 

​

&gt;And then! Oh, the posts! Oh, the posts!  
 Posts! Posts! Posts!  
 That’s one thing he hated! The posts!  
 POSTS! POSTS! POSTS!  
 

​

&gt;Then the fans young and old would talk and they’d guess.  
 And they’d guess! And they’d guess! And they’d GUESS!  
 GUESS! GUESS! GUESS!  
 

​

&gt;They would guess there’d be Waddle Dee, and Minecraft’s own Steve.  
 Which was something the Grinch couldn’t stand to conceive.  
 And then they’d do something he liked least of all!  
 Every fan down in Smashville, the tall and the small,  
 

​

&gt;Would all come together, like fish on a string.  
 Having taken the bait, oh to the threads they would cling!  
 His phone would ding! It would ding! It would Ding!  
 DING! DING! DING!  
 

​

&gt;And the more the Grinch listened to his phone go ring ding,  
 The more the Grinch thought, “I must stop this whole thing!”  
 “Why, for 231 days I’ve put up with it now!”  
 “I must stop these fake leaks from coming! But how?”  
 

​

&gt;Then he got an idea! An awful idea!  
 THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFULLY AWFUL IDEA!  
 “I know just what to do!” The Grinch laughed in his throat.  
 And he broke out his laptop and started to gloat.  
 

​

&gt;And he chuckled, and clucked, “What a great Grinchy trick!”  
 “With this promo poster I have, they’ll know it’s legit!”  
 “All I need is a platform…” The grinch searched around.  
 But since the fanbase is large, no new ones were found.  
 

​

&gt;Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply yelled,  
 “If they can post on 4 chan, I’ll make one myself!”  
 So he took out a pan and took up a pad,  
 He wrote, and he wrote, the fans won’t be had!  
 

​

&gt;Then he added some cuses and some deconfirms too,  
 “There’s no new playable Pokemon, oh no, boo hoo.”  
 Then the Grinch yelled “It’s done!” and so he clicked,  
 It was posted online, but soon he was ticked.  
 

​

&gt;The board remained dark. Quiet posts filled the air.  
 All the fans disregarded his post without care.  
 He read the replies, of which their were few,  
 “This leak is fake! This guy has no clue!”

"It’s the same concept that you have to be rich to be a minimalist simply because you don’t want to be crowded in by a bunch of stuff to maintain.

Honestly, that’s the perpetual myth. We’re sold it in our media every day. Poor should hoard more for ‘what if’ scenarios, the people on WIC and food stamps spending the entire lot at the first of the month because they won’t have the money at the end of the month.

Fact is, it’s being sold on the windfall theory. Poor should spend that extra resource on high ticket items because what if there isn’t a windfall next time? I should stock up on toilet paper because I might not have the money by next month.  Things like that.

Granted, it’s not easy to live paycheck to paycheck, or even not have enough for basic necessities because of how much you’re getting paid. That’s not the problem, everyone’s attitudes toward the problem are. 

America was founded on the concept of bringing yourself up by the bootstraps, which made sense in a booming industrialist society. A person could walk into a mill and get hired. But it’s different now.

Going back to minimalism, being poor, you should be living on what you need, first. In fact, I can wager that maximalism, the image in our minds of that aging soccer mom with an attic, basement, spare bedroom and garage so full they can’t park the car, that’s a problem of the upper middle class.

As for poor people? There are a lot of studies done in Social Communications that suggests that poor people are simply advertised to more than any socio-economic class.

"The rape scene gets most of the attention, but I think it’s worth noting that there is no way to just ignore rape in Goblin Slayer. Skipping the rape scene does not avoid rape. The setting is *built* on rape. Every single goblin is both a rapist and the child of a rape victim. And goblins are said to be so numerous and to breed so quickly (read: rape so often) that there’s no way to eradicate them.

The world of Goblin Slayer is a world of rape. Sure, there’s a lot more to the setting than goblins... but goblins are the focus of *Goblin* Slayer. The world building being what it is, the story of Goblin Slayer cannot continue without rape."

"&gt;you seem to feel strongly

I feel strongly about people calling something a false flag every other day. 

&gt;so, what is your opinion about it?

I lean more towards this is probably legit. A dumb kid or some local idiot. If this were a false flag carried out by ""Deep State"", then it wouldn't be a sloppy job. They probably would have detonated real explosives. 

If the goal is, as people are saying, to make Democrats look good, then nothing would do the job better than dead people. If you believe 9/11 was an inside job and school shootings amd other mass casualty events are false flags and all that, then it sounds absolutely ridiculous alleging *this* is a false flag with shitty fake explosives, shitting packaging etc. 

This crap in the pictures wouldn't even fly in a decent high school play. If this were a false flag, it would go for maximum effect: body count, real explosives. Not shitty 8th grade props. 
I disagree with the assumption the media is making about how it has to be a maga bomber. It could be a Bernie zealot too.. I havent drawn a conclusion on this though. Just thoughts.


The logic isn't there for a false flag though. Any rational person wishing to stage an attack to benefit their party in upcoming elections woulda gone for it all. This was most likely some amateur nutcase. Maybe even a kid"

"Okay, let's concentrate on the most insane part of the film in question.

How do you go from ""Beef, not chicken"" and ""Grilling, not cooking"" - all the way to ""violence, unemotionality, and sexual aggression""? (the latter is taken from Geek Feminism Wiki article on toxic masculinity) How do you jump from ""barbecue over fries"" to ""rape""? What kind of hallucinogens do you need to take?

The script writer of this film, with the blessing of the director, thought of this parts as some sort of obvious and good metaphors. To me, they're bad *even* as emotional arguments.

I understand what you mean, but something tells me that when it ""happens all the time"" in real life, there are several crucial differences to what the film depicts: the people in question are most likely not as pale, not as athletic, not jocks, not frat members, and most likely not as young. The characters of the film don't even seem as strawmen to me; they're more like Frankenstein monsters. "

"Having watched many documentaries about Scientology, I have absolutely no doubt that what you say is true. I may be way off base on my assumption but it seems like they’re against mental health treatment as a whole and most- if not all- treatment for physical ailments by modern medicine.

Which stands to reason, seeing as their method is just brainwashing and gaslighting people into submission. So therapists and mental health professionals are the bane of their existence because they will try to undo what the cult has done to them.

I’m in no way against mental health treatment and dealt with my wife’s PPD less than a year ago, not to mention having been treated for anxiety and depression myself. The only reason I bring this up is because I wanted it to be clear that I’m not a Scientologist or against mental health treatment. 

My above post wasn’t meant to say Cruise is some kind of saint. I haven’t really followed pop culture in several years but I do remember hearing when he and Katie Holmes divorced that her life was miserable with him. I don’t remember a single detail only that her life was controlled on a minute-by-minute basis by Cruise and the cult. 

I don’t doubt that it’s true. What I was trying to convey in my comment was that he has some good left in him. I thoroughly believe he’s crazy a shithouse rat and that the public doesn’t know half the crazy stuff going on with those people. 

However, I think many people in his position would’ve wanted attention and praise for what he did for that lady. He could’ve made a big presentation with a big cardboard check and did in the name of being a good Scientologist and been on every news channel and website in the world.

But he didn’t. He just stopped, and helped someone in need so she wouldn’t be alone. When he found out she was gonna be hit with a big bill, he paid it because he has the means. She then made it public, not him. And I’ve heard he’s done stuff like that many times. 

So has done stuff that’s fucked up? Absolutely. I’m just saying from my perspective he still seems to have good in him.

"This is a very real thing and hits home for me. I'm currently going through this right now. My ex-wife brutally beat my 3 year old son. Everything has been a struggle down to the organizations that are supposed to be there for domestic abuse victims, I've been told I'm/my son is not a victim and that I need to handle things personally among many other things over the course of these months.  Forensics nurses said it was the worse case of abuse they've ever seen in their career. He had 20-30 different injuries littered all over his body. She won't be facing jail time and as a father that's just  something I have to accept and i don't hold that against the people that have helped and fought for my son. It's just the judicial state we live in. Here's to hoping in the end I can at least have full custody and protect my child. Wish me luck boys. I'll need it."

Click the cell you want to pull values from sheet 2 for. In your example, John Kerry

Then go too sheet 2, select the whole column that has the names, then drag to the column of the value you want to look up. Use ‘step’ as an example 

Then , followed by the number of columns from the lookup reference (the column on sheet 2 with the names) to the value (step) - so it would be ,3

Right on brother thank you. Currently taking Zantac which seems to help slightly. Been wary of the PPI’s like Prilosec due to some of the side effects so I’ve stuck with the Zantac so far.

"Comp. Sci major here so I can speak a bit.

Chem 102/112 can be pretty rough but is doable and is only time consuming around test times due to the amount of studying you may need to do.

Math 152 and its tests weren't too bad, if you prepare for it. In terms of how much time it took out of my day it was pretty similar to 151 imo.

I cannot speak for Engr 216 as that is new but last years version (Engr 112) was very time consuming towards the second half of the semester, but you'll have to take this regardless for ETAM.

As for physics, unless you plan on taking ECEN upper level classes or are unsure about computer science being your major I'd recommend not taking this class at all if you want a higher gpa and less course work. I don't think the degree plan has changed from last years but if you are dead set on being a computer science major you don't even have to touch physics like most other engineers. If you want to ask about if the requirements have changed you should email a CS advisor they'd know more than the general engineering advisors on this topic. What I did instead of physics is I took an easy science class. I recommend Prof. Logan for Atmo 201 if you are going that route. 

Those classes + an easy UCC shouldn't be too bad. "

"Haha my cats are the same, they go after every fly they see, jump on everything, play with everything... But I think they know the rats aren't to prey on because they see me handle them. Cats are smart animals and they do learn from us, so if they see us being friendly with other animals, they often understand that they have to be friendly too. My cats are very curious about the rats and will often watch 'rat tv', and as I said, they sometimes go after the rats in a playful way. But they never bite the rats or try to really get them, like they would with a prey (mostly they are only interested in their tail because they can play with it). 

I think your cat and rats will be fine. Just watch out for them and try to be present when they interact with each other. It will be a learning process for all of them and it will take a bit of time. By the way, do you have a spray bottle with water for when the cat does something he isn't supposed to? They often hate water so most of the time a few drops are enough to teach them a lesson :)

Oh and don't worry too much about your new rats either! I bet they will love their new home. And did you know that rats are very good at standing up for themselves? My rats hiss at our cats when they come too close, and the rats have no problem with biting a cat when they really feel like they have to defend themselves. I think it happened like 1 or 2 times when the cat went after a rat in a playful way, but the rat didn't really like it. A cat learns quickly in a situation like that! I'm glad this doesn't happen often though, I don't want my cats to get hurt either... (although I think the rats don't bite very hard the first time, its more like a warning I guess). 

I'm really glad I could help a bit. I don't know if everything will be helpful as every situation is different and I'm only speaking from my own experience. But you can always ask if you have more questions. And I hope to see a photo of your new babies on this sub when you have them! :)"

"I've found that the easiest way to spot ideologues is to read a text, then read the reviews.

Those with a genuine interest in truth have clearly read the piece they are reviewing, and will make legitimate points to the authors argument.

Those interested in shoring up a narrative on the other hand, seem to skim a piece (at best) looking for places to insert canned talking-points amid generally over-emotional rhetoric.

Have you ever heard the phrase ""enough rope""? The adage goes that you give someone without integrity enough rope, and they will actually hang *themselves*. Amazing how effective a process this is, serves as a powerful argument for the value of free speech.

I wonder whether it has something to do with having little experience defending one's own arguments outside of an echo-chamber, actually attempting to change minds, rather than merely signal virtue.

This behaviour is why research often  reports that argument only leads to the entrenchment of prior views. It's not genuine argument being measured, but rhetorical signalling.

"It's only clear to you because you **want** this narrative to be true. Personally, I *suspect* that this was done by someone who despises the left, but I also realized that the ideologies of these fringe-terrorist rarely fit into such a narrative.

Search my comment history about the recent ricin, sent to President Trump and others. No where did I condemn the ""violent left"" or use this as evidence of the ""unhinged democrats."" Certainly, many pundits used that development to make broad sweeping claims. But I did not. 

We still don't know much about the ricin attacker but we do know he threaten Obama in the past and appeared paranoid in social media. **This is why we should wait until we make sweeping claims without evidence**. 

Could this be a far-right individual who supports the Republicans and has been motivated by republican rhetoric. Sure. But it could also be a mentally unhinged individual attempting to make a name of themselves, create false-flag, or someone simply apathetic to politics and simply trying to stir up shit. We don't know and we can't say because **lone wolf terrorists, who aren't directed/funded by organizations, rarely fit in well-defined ideological movements.** 

&gt;It is clear.... you're not fooling anyone. ...It's obvious, and your mental gymnastics to avoid it are telling.

Must be nice seeing the world so clearly. But I suppose with the election coming up, it's time to ignore caution and use this (or the ricin attack) as evidence of how dangerous the other side is.

"Most everyone used pole arms as a primary weapon, even Vikings.


""A wealthy Viking would likely have a complete ensemble of a spear, a wooden shield, and either a battle axe or a sword. The very richest might have a helmet; other armour is thought to have been limited to the nobility and their professional warriors. The average farmer was likely limited to a spear, shield, and perhaps a common axe or a large knife or seax. Some would also bring their hunting bows (mostly long bow or flat bow) to use in the opening stages of battle.""

Romans used several throwing darts and pilums as primary weapons before they went to their gladius.

*Also returns November 16, 2018 at 18:00 EET – November 20, 2018 at 09:59 EET

Maybe $35M/yr but def not over 10 years. Personally I think he’s a bit overrated. If a team felt like they needed him for say 3/$105 maybe I’d do it if it put me over the top. But no 10 year deal is worth it IMO.  I’d rather pay more a year for less control which gives both the team and player some flexibility but more so protecting the tram from being locked in on an albatross.

"It looks like an older style of thermistor. The glue is likely some form of heat transfer cement.

First of all, do not fuck with gas. This isn't a component that is directly involved with gas regulation, but turn off the gas at the supply income before doing anything.

If the component comes away freely, you should be able to test if it is a thermistor by measuring the resistance both at room temperature, and with a heat source nearby. If it indeed is a thermistor, you will need to re-attach the thermistor using a proper heat conductive cement. CPU thermal paste will **NOT** suffice for this application. Contact cement, silicone, JB-Weld or epoxy are not suitable either.

A reputable hardware store should have a solution for you. As well as negating any air bubbles in the contact area, I also suggest you use a rubber band to temporarily secure the thermistor to the pipe. Once the conductive cement cures, the thermistor should no longer require the band, and I strongly suggest you remove it.

Note: Do **NOT** use a conductive material to secure the thermistor to the pipe. It will cause erratic readings and will likely be a safety hazard. Similarly, be *completely* sure that the conductive cement used is electrically non-conductive. 

Again, if something seems off, or you can't turn off the gas, don't fuck with it. Leave it and call a professional."

"I love reading quest text. This is canonical dialogue spoken by thrall:


""Rexxar wanders the road from Feralas to Stonetalon Peak, except he cuts north from the area with the demons and goes through the Kodo Graveyard, before taking the road north out of there (or south into there). He also wanders slightly into Stonetalon Peak and Feralas (as far as The Twin Colossals in Feralas) so if you're having no luck finding him, search a little bit into both zones.""

This isn't part of the basic text that precedes dialogue, he says this after speaking in first person. I don't know why but this is the most memorable part of the game for me for how funny it is imagining Thrall giving absurdly detailed directions on finding Rexxar."

"&gt;He stared at the screen, clenching his fist.  
 Translating from French to English was hardly a synch.  
 He needed hard evidence, that much was clear.  
 But a photo? Too easily faked was his fear.  
 

​

&gt;He thought and he thunk, about what he should do.  
 A video might cost him his job, that much was true.  
 “These characters,” he grinned, “the public must know!”  
 He knew it was time to put on a show.  
 

​

&gt;He looked round the room, to make sure none could hear,  
 And he took out his phone, with much newfound cheer.  
 “And now!” grinned the Grinch “I’ll put them in a slum!”  
 He took out his phone, then took out his thumb.  
 

​

&gt;He was swiping through apps, to decide what to use,  
 When he heard a loud sound, like the honk of a goose.  
 He turned around fast, and he saw the night-watchman,  
 It was Jack, oh how he hated this Scotsman.  
 

​

&gt;The Grinch had been caught by this large man of honor,  
 Who’d seen the light left on, but the Grinch was no goner.  
 He started at the Grinch and barked, “Oh Eric, why,”  
 “Why are you taking pics of this banner? WHY?”  
 

​

&gt;But you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,  
 He thought up a lie and he thought it up quick!  
 “Why my sweet old friend Jack,” the Grinchy Eric lied,  
 “There was a rip in this banner messing it up on one side!”  
 

​

&gt;“So I was asked to stay late and fix it, my dear.”  
 “I’m texting the boss about the new one right here.”  
 And his fib fooled the watchman. Then the Grinch shook his head,  
 “You’re keeping me from my work,” he said.  
 

​

&gt;And when Jack the Scotsman went away in a huff,  
 The Grinch took out his phone and loaded it up!  
 He lined up the evidence onto a desk,  
 Opened up snapchat, and thought of something grotesque.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He started recording the leak right there with his phone,  
 Writing “fuck you Nintendo lolllll” now all would be known!  
 He sent it along waiting for a response,  
 Someone screen-grabbed his snap with no nonchalance.  
 

​

&gt;It was a quarter past midnight, some fans still in beds,  
 With dreams of Shantae and Elma in heads.  
 The Grinch he just sat, he sat, and waited.  
 Happy with the silence he had soon created.  
 

​

&gt;Safe and anonymous, thanks to snapchat,  
 He’d surely put an end to speculation chitchat.  
 “PoohPooh to the fans!” he was Grinchishly humming.  
 “They’re finding out now no more surprises are coming!”  
 

​

&gt;“They’re just waking up! I know what they’ll do!”  
 “Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,  
 Then the fans down in Smashville will all cry boohoo!”  
 “That’s a noise,” Grinned the Grinch, “That I simply MUST hear!”  
 So he paused. And the Grinch refreshed pages with cheer.  
 

​

&gt;And he did read some words, flooding into the site.  
 It started out light, then his eyes widened in fright.  
 The words aren’t sad! Why, they sounded merry!  
 It couldn’t be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!  
 

​

&gt;He stared down at Smashville and the Grinch popped his eyes!  
 To his core he shook, what he read was a shocking surprise!  
 Every fan down in Smashville, both casual and hardcore,  
 Were cheering and cheering! With no surprises in store!  
 

​

&gt;He hadn’t stopped leaks from coming, they came!  
 What’s worse, he found out, they'd discovered his name!  
 And the Grinch, with his grinch-ears ringing with dinging,  
 Stood puzzling, and puzzling, “To what are they clinging?”  
 

​

&gt;“It came without Directs! Without trailer posts!  
 It came without Sakurai, Reggi, or treehouse live hosts!”  
 And he puzzled and puzzled, till his puzzler was sore.  
 Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn’t before!  
 

​

&gt;“Maybe hyping” he thought, “Doesn’t come from fake leaks.”  
 “Maybe hyping… perhaps… isn’t something so meek!”  
 And what happened then? Well in Smashville they say,  
 Smash Ultimate’s roster grew three sizes that day.  
 

​

&gt;And the minute that Sakurai got word of the leak,  
 The cheers of his fans kept it from ruining his week.  
 The leaks they had come, but it hadn’t mattered.  
 The people were happy, and their hopes were untattered.  
 

​

&gt;The trailers now could confirm restored hopes and new hype,  
 Hype that would keep ringing and dinging each night.﻿"

"&gt; Remove gravity, and is there a corresponding explaination for buoyancy, or does it just become a fundamental thing, like how gravity just pulls things together. 

They generally just say there's a defined up and down. In their world, denser things fall is essentially an axiom. The more ""rigorous"" ones call it ""axiomatic tendency"".

&gt; How does your flat Earther explain, mathematically, things of very different densities falling at a similar rate?

Math is a tool of Satan. It can be used to support anything. I'm only partly joking.

They tend to avoid making predictions or performing calculations. Most are mathematically challenged, and they generally don't trust math. They pretty much force you to fight with both arms tied behind your back, which is kind of fun.

I got one to agree that the an object exerts force that depends on its mass by bringing up objects of the same mass with different densities on a balance scale, which is I ended up with this proposed experiment. I was trying to make the same argument you made at the start of your comment, that the upthrust is a result of the stronger force of the fluid trying to fill the space, so they contrived a situation where there is not enough fluid mass to displace the object. He claimed the object would still float, because relative densities were preserved. I was not sure, so here I am."

"Mine never worked out of the box, even after they sent a replacement wheel base. They also tried to make me spend an extra $100 on pedals after lying to me that the CSR pedals I ordered were out of stock. I ended up throwing it all in a box and shipping it back to Fanatec, after 2 weeks of nothing working. They tried to charge me a restocking fee, but American Express wasn't having that. Then I bought a Thrustmaster T300RS, which promptly malfunctioned from steering it too fast in American Truck Sim - I heard a pop, smelled smoke, and now the wheel makes a constant grinding sound. I'm not sure there's any solid choice in this industry at this point."

"Most banks these days are required to have a free checking account. I would get one of those because they are really easy to maintain! As long as you don’t overdraw your account you can usually avoid any fees. However, with the free checking account they usually hit you with ATM fees. Just get online banking to check your balance and if you need cash and don’t want those ATM fees just go into a  cvs or something and buy a cheap candy bar or gum and get cash back!

"There's a lot to being ""smart"". Grades can definitely be one of them, but it also depends on how you apply yourself. Even charisma can go a long way in making yourself seem more credible to others. 

High school grades aren't really a good indicator of intelligence. You could go to community college, start your own business, and become a millionaire. You could also go to an ivy league school, fail to set yourself apart from anyone, and end up making less than six figures. 

I think the best summary of what ""smart"" is is being self-aware of your own flaws and fixing them in order to better yourself. Grades may or may not be reflective of that; it depends on your priorities."

"&gt;Yes, and we have evidence that everything is caused by something else.

Wrong. We have evidence that everything within our universe is caused by something else. That does not mean there are not things outside our universe that don't follow such laws. Technically speaking the evidence we have that everything withing the universe has a cause doesn't necessarily apply to the universe as a whole. To make this jump would be a [fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition).

&gt; My point was it's rational to pursue the cause.

Nobody is arguing that we should not pursue the cause. What i'm saying is it isn't rational to believe that the cause was a god."

"If ensuring tribal voices are heard is racial discrimination to you then I have trouble trusting your intentions here. This is based on tribal membership not race and is for a variety of groups of people. But to answer the other questions:

To ensure environmental justice and equitable benefits from the bill, we want to not only reduce wildfires but reduce the impact of wildfires on the population and those groups are more likely to be impacted if they don’t get appropriate education and notification of the risks of wildfires. Some wildfires are healthy for forests but we have to ensured people aren’t at risk. This is also just one of several types of projects that could be enacted under this section. 

The panel is under the oversight of the governor and legislature who are accountable to voters, just like the dozens of other boards in the government. They make recommendations but the legislature makes the final appropriations. This is in section 10.

Absolutely, all of the approved proposals will be available to the public and the board and departments of ecology and commerce are required to publish reports covering the projects and their effectiveness. This is in section 12. 

Thanks for your curiosity and I do hope that even if you still have concerns about this section you will see the broad benefits to all parts of the state that this will have to reducing carbon and effects of climate change and air pollution. "

"I don't want to be an ass; it's just really noticeable how many ""I"" statements you used in this entire thing.  It doesn't sound like you are the unconditionally loving friend that you thought you were being.  If you had really not worried about how you looked as a friend and just solely worried about her well being, you should have admitted her so she got the help she really needed.  

Also, people get crazy nuts about the importance of their own weddings, just no one thinks it is as important as you do. Especially when the other person is in a self destructive mode and really isn't even focused on your feelings at all.  If you knew she wasn't stable and was in this bad frame of mind, you should have gently advised her that in her emotional state, you didn't feel as though you could trust her condition when it appears she was doing nothing to help herself, rather than trying to look like you were coming from a place of live and understanding, when we see now you are holding onto a lot of animosity over how she was at your wedding.

It sounds like you are in the medical or psychiatric profession, so how you just let her go to work after a suicide attempt is beyond me or how you thought that anything involving her was going to go smoothly while she is suffering mental illness.

It feels like if you were going to take responsibility for trying to help her yourself, you have to go all the way and if you were expecting her to get the help herself, then should have let the system work for her.  I'm sure your feelings toward who she can be as a good friend clouded your judgment and it was probably equally confusing for her; her thinking you know how she is and that you're loving her unconditionally, when really there were unspoken conditions and she broke them.

You're both playing around in a gray area where you are hurting each other, instead of communicating clearly about your mutual expectations and abilities.  My thought is that you both owe each other some clear and respectful honesty so you can both move on with your lives with a clear view of where you stand.

"It was actually the other way around. The French generals and military strategy leading up to the war was almost purely defensively focused. They created a huge line of forts at the German border and concentrated their armed forces at the Belgian border in order to avoid what happened in WWI. What they did not focus on (although it was still defended, albeit lightly) was the Ardennes forest, which they believed would be impassable to armor and large units of infantry.

This is precisely where the Germans struck, and the speed with which their panzer divisions encircled the French forces at the Belgian border meant that the army was cut off

Germans then left the maginot line entirely alone to focus on driving into the French heartland. With their army cut off and almost no answer to the panzer blitzkrieg (not to mention the Weimar not being far behind), France was overrun quickly

The downfall of the French was more that they believed what would happen in WWI would also happen again, and did not foresee how effective the blitzkrieg would be (they were not alone in this)

They were hunkered down for a long defensive war and were arguably well suited for one...but the Germans struck the one place they overlooked "

"If you plan to remain Free To Play, I advise waiting several months before you spend any gems on character fragments at all. Stick to getting fragments from Hero Challenge events, Alliance Essence, Battle Essence, Red Alerts and the Campaign nodes. 

Most of your gems should go towards refreshing the gear upgrade events on the weekend when they're all available at once. Gear is the biggest factor in character strength overall, and access is limited without spending gems.

Don't bother spending gems to refresh the other events like the Fearsome/Essential Powers and Lord of the Unliving. Not yet anyways. You'll get lots of Rings (for upgrading character abilities) from daily missions for now, and as a newer player you shouldn't need too much Legendary Essence yet.

Focus on characters you will be able to get to advance in Rank. The new free monthly character and characters available from Red Alerts and the PvP/Alliance stores. Getting legendary skills is important for most characters, and a character stuck at 4 stars (r4) is not going to be very useful once all your opponents are using Legendary powers. Most characters don't even have all their skills unlocked at all until they hit r5. Avoid upgrading gear on characters you don't have easy access to upgrade in Rank. Eventually they will be offered a Hero Challenge event, and then you can gear them up."

2. Many people love to hate on Bose, so getting ANC that's as good or better than Bose paired with better sound quality makes everyone go nuts.
3. There's been a rapid release cycle of new wireless ANC headphones over the last couple of years, so people are getting caught up in the whole ""it's a newer, slightly better version"" thing that affects smartphones and other luxury tech items.

With that said, I have thought about picking up a pair myself. Do love a good hype train from time to time.

In this case BD comes out ahead on mini-league points at 8, but both NiP and paiN have 4 mini-league points. Then it goes to mini-league round difference. NiP did go +1 RD against paiN while paiN went -1, but against BD NiP went -5 while paiN went -2. This means overall NiP has a mini-league RD of -4 and paiN have a mini-league RD of -3. Therefor in the 3 way tie BD would have been 6th, paiN 7th, and NiP 8th."

"For starters, lyrica is so much better then gabapentin, but I’m assuming that is not at your disposal. I’ve taken all of the mentioned meds so I would say that since you have only been on Xanax for two months, that can be tapered within 2 weeks or so. Go from 3mg to 2mg, then 2mg to 1mg, then 1mg to 0mg in SOME comforting fashion. Also I would dose the Xanax twice daily, so I would split the daily dose in half.

There is no 100% “comfortable” way off benzos really, you will half to experience some withdrawal, and you will be surprised at what you can handle withdrawal wise if determined enough. 

Now while feeling some withdrawal symptoms, I would take 20mg baclofen and around 900mg to 1200mg gabapentin split throughout the day. This is just me though... 

If this is your first benzo detox, this isn’t nothing compared to years of high dosing benzos, which is where recreational Xanax will lead, guaranteed. Please be motivated to get off it, no anxiety or insomnia warrants a benzo dependence."

They're old now and still together, and they only get passive agressive towards each other when mad, I guess they don't have the energy to fight anymore, but I'm glad they stuck together for my sister and I, even though they came close to divorcing 100 times."

After hearing that, naturally I tell him about how you can actually die from drinking too much, and that it's one of the main risks involved in taking mdma and he just goes ""well I disagree, in my experience you need to drink more than usual when you're rolling because otherwise you dehydrate faster"".

"I honestly think we can slow this offense down. They really didn’t look that great against a defense we shredded. If SF didn’t turn it over a million times, that looks like a completely different game. 

We aren’t going to stop them, but we don’t have to. Just get a few stops. I think we can hang with their receivers and do enough to slow down Gurley. Hold them to around 24-31.

Then the offense just has to play a clean game and we have a shot. The first 6 games may make that seem unlikely, but I feel like we are due. Bye week plus Rodgers and receivers getting healthy could be a recipe for improved results."

I imagine you don't use RH because It doesn't let you actually make the call/put contracts it seems...

You basically sold the right to sell 100 amzn shares at that price, without owning those shares. So a naked put. Does this mean someone paid you 2k for that, and if it doesn't end ITM you get to just keep the 2k? And if it is in the money you don't necessarily lose 163k or whatever, you just will have sold them that much in value. 

So, in that case, would you have to basically rebuy those 100 shares at whatever price and your losses are however much more amzn is over that strike price, per share?"

"Anybody can make a bomb with stuff from the nearest hardware shop and garden store. The problem is that most will not be able to build something that actually works, works right, or works when it should(like that one white supremacist guy who tried to make a rather fancy homemade bomb that's known for being extremely dangerous to put together due to its volatility. He ended up blowing himself up in his home in the process of putting it together).

Pipe bombs like these are also notoriously unreliable and generally weak bombs. Few people have died from pipe bombs, requiring really close proximity to them to actually kill(most pipe bomb deaths have been that of the bomber who made it). So they're realistically a pure terror weapon which is also why they're basically illegal entirely(even if you never plan to use it anywhere, just having it is a crime, regardless of intent).

I just hope they get the guy or guys responsible before they decide to try blowing themselves up like that dude in Texas who had been mailing bombs to African-Americans and blew himself up in his car after a short police chase."

Her counter argument was speculating what would happen if it happened to be raining when we ran outside. My way we'd be stuck walking around in 2 wet socks. Her way, you could hop around on the one shod foot and prevent the other foot from walking on wet pavement.

"It is market comparable but it isnt market value. Everyone has the argument that hes not better than pasta.  But what everyone seems To forget is that pastas contract is a steal.  Why didn’t eichel sign for sheifele money? Why didn’t OEL sign for Hedman money? Is it a reasonable contract? Yes i Think Nylanders worth should start with a 6 IN THE LEAFS roster. But i Think many teams would be willing to pay him 8+x7 and that wouldnt be a really bad contract. Its a bad contract for the Leafs because the crunch is coming.  But thats not really willies(agents) problem . So i dont Think an arbitrator would rule in the Leafs favor. 

It really isnt a case of , hes a 25 goal 65-70 point scorer, hes not worth more than X amount. Many players arent worth their pay in their first years , especially after their ELC. Vegas just Signed Alex tuch for a little under 5 mil. He hasnt shown that he is worth that much money. But you take the calculated risk , and it usually pays off. 

And a talent like Nylander will Most likely be a dominant player in the League, scoring 85-90 on austons wing . Then he will easily be worth his contract. And he just doesn’t want To become a chump and undervalue himself, a la sheifele for example. 

Now with that said IMHO i Think Camp Nylander is beeing a little greedy,  since the team has shown that they want him,  and it isnt a matter of saying , Willie youre not worth the 8 million youre asking, its more of a we can only give you this much even though we would like To give you 10.

"A bit like /u/thewamp said, reddit is very... one-sided when it comes to MTX, any opposite opinion are downvoted, this drives people of said opposite opinion away, or people join that sub's mentality to fit in, after all, this is a *social* news website.

The upvote/downvote system in particular creates echo chambers because disagreeing opinions are drowned out.

Furthermore, on reddit as a whole, there is a strong mentality that ""If you don't hate XYZ, you're part of the problem."", I've read more than once that if you buy MTX in a game, you're literally the reason why the game is going bad. 

Now, bias goes both ways, if you were to post your poll on the official forums (assuming the post stayed up and wasn't instantly deleted), you'd get a far more positive view on MTX. The reason being that on the official forums, disagreeing(negative) opinions on the game are deleted pretty quickly.

This actually compounds the problem. People who have negative opinions on the game, being dismissed from the official forums, turn to alternatives, such as reddit. Meanwhile, the people that stick to the official forums tend to be pretty biased towards the company.

So you end up with two communities that enjoy the same game, having vastly different opinions on the game and its MTX. "

When we left someone almost ran over some people walking so they could fly up in front and behind us in two cars and talk a bunch of shit to get pics of us angry. We aren't famous at all, they had no idea who we were and they almost killed people to get our pics.

Fuck these people."

"There are many things that could address the actual cost of care, and none of those involve forcing everyone to pay the government just so that the government can underpay providers. For starters, we need to allow people to opt out of the incredibly inefficient Medicare/Medicaid/insurance framework and get people to paying out of pocket for their own costs. Then we can also end patents on drugs, end the state monopoly on licensing for healthcare professionals, and end certificates of need for hospitals. That would be a fantastic start towards actually lowering costs."
"One thing I've learned is that emotional attachment doesn't \*have to\* mean a change in relationship. So if you'd like a mostly-sexual relationship with someone, there are people willing to do that, even with emotional ties. You really can't control feelings, but you can control what your expectations are for what you do about the feelings which could be as simple as ""nothing.""

In other words you can begin a relationship on these terms: ""Hey I need sex more often than my partners, but I'm tapped out as far as commitments for time, dating, and emotional labor go. If you'd like to have sex a couple times a week that would be great, and if feelings develop that's great and it will enrich my experience, but it won't change my availability.""

This is more of a relationship anarchy rather than a poly style of relating but it might be a fit for you."

&gt;You don't need licenses for this. Whoever is constructing the bridge has a vested interest in hiring someone who knows what they are doing.

You clearly fucking don't, because no qualified engineer OR trained economist would agree.

A construction contractor has no *vested interest in hiring someone* unless they feel some sort of social responsibility.  The people who make those decisions KNOW they'll never be held criminally responsible, so the only *vested interest* they give a fuck about is lining the company's pocket, and by extension its owners or investors.  The sheer number of cut corners on ANY construction project you could inspect, some resulting in death are proof of that.  From single family homes with poor electrical, ventilation or drainage, to [commercial skyscrapers](https://amp.businessinsider.com/is-millennium-tower-safe-still-leaning-sinking-2017-9) to [pedestrian overpasses](
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_International_University_pedestrian_bridge_collapse).


Eat that libertardian shit and die.


&gt;Someone with education, references, and experience. And if the person putting up the bridge is liable for damages from an accident that further incentives hiring a good engineer. No license required. Furthermore, if there were no licenses, you would have more engineers, hence more competition, hence better and cheaper engineers. Engineers want higher wages so they push for licenses.

No, fuck you.  Engineers push for licensing to provide a *minimum, guaranteed standard of knowledge and accountability*.  Just like preventing homeopathic cranks and quacks from calling themselves medical doctors.  This is why we have standards for anything and everything, because they're always pieces of shit like you who will try to cheat the system at the risk of other people's lives knowing they will not be held accountable.


&gt;You *don't* know that a random restaurant on the road is healthy even with health licenses. You have no practical way of knowing that they are licensed, or if they are keeping up with standards.

...

Of course you fucking do.

EVERY western democratic jurisdiction I've ever visited, from the United States, to Canada to the UK, Germany and more require that those licenses and certifications be displayed or available to the public for inspection in the restaurant.  You want to see the certified proof that I maintain standards of health and cleanliness in my restaurant? Well here they are!

Clearly you don't know fuck all about how business actually works and what the government has been doing for you for more than a hundred years, literally.

&gt;If you can't see how going to college, getting background checks, paying periodic fees, and taking courses every year isn't jumping through hoops there is no hope for you. Academics is not equivalent to teaching. There are people who would make excellent teachers but do bad at college level academics so they don't become teachers so the students get worse teachers. To make it worse, there are people who are good at academics but bad at teaching further reducing the quality of teachers. *Any* barrier to entry reduces the amount of people in the field. That is an economic truth. All that education you had to do reduces the amount of teachers, reducing the supply of teachers while not changing the demand, increasing your wages at the cost of literally everyone else. 

jfc what is this i can't even

Are you a Scientologist, or do you sell homeopathic remedies, or has mommy been feeding you chicken tendies literally your entire life?

Fuck you, China.  These are the sorts of times China should be executing government officials caught in corruption scandals.

Pieces of shit like you who think everything should be subject to the free market are a plague on our society.  You think corporate profits are more important than human lives, and removing rules makes things better; it does not.  It gives trash like you the opportunity to take advantage of other human beings, to belittle, steal, cheat or abuse them.

I hope you'll eat some delicious e.coli at your next unregulated restaurant, perhaps if you survive shitting yourself to death through dehydration, or kidney failure you'll remember that the reason many rules are in place are to prevent trash like you from killing us all.

"&gt;The first is your implication that character optimization only deals with the Combat pillar of the game.

I was specifically replying to the comment ""DnD is a wargame and fighting monsters is the entire raison d'etre."" I reply by saying that combat is only one aspect of the game. You rightfully pointed out several other aspects of the game.

Since I specifically discuss combat and only combat in my reply, then I have to assume that people who downvoted me (I noticed it had like 3 upvotes, then suddenly it was down into the negatives) are upset because I said that combat wasn't D&amp;D's only purpose. Take a look at what other people have said to me, there are lots of people who say that combat is D&amp;D's main or only purpose.

&gt;it was started by belac39 excoriating people for not ignoring the mechanics.

belac39 said he felt people were too obsessed with optimizing their characters for purely mechanical reasons and not for *story* reasons--for instance, he brings up ""why is your character considering making a pact with a demon sword.""

"The foreign espionage laws were not fuckups. They were bi partisan and in direct response to China operating in a hostile way on Australian soil. Sure the ASIO report was leaked, China got mad their dirty laundry was being aired in public. That laundry goes directly against their “we don’t meddle in other nations affairs” lie. 

It’s probably why the ABC was recently banned in China. Funnily enough the ABC released an investigative foreign correspondent episode about the “re-education” camps about a week after it was blocked in China.

"they can just do it like wow, have the dungeons and then then the mythic+ dungeons. in wow normal dungeons have 3 difficulties, normal, heroic and mythic. once you complete a mythic dungeon, you get a keystone. depending on how well your team cleared the dungeon your keystone will get a level. if you have say a +10 keystone, then you can enter a mythic dungeon, use your keystone at the altar and upgrade it to a mythic +10 dungeon, this will increase the hp and dmg of the trash mobs and the bosses exponentially, it will also add mutators to the dungeon. sanguine will make a puddle of goo where the enemy died and anyone standing in it takes damage over time. there are other mutators where it reduces the threat threshold greatly, so tanks can't hold agro for long and the entire team must run around and try and stay alive while the tank tries to gain agro again. the higher level mythic u do, the better loot you get. the faster you finish the mythic+ dungeon, the more loot you will get. if you can not finish it within the timer, your keystone will get depleted, only way to  charge it is to run a mythic +dungeon with your depleted key, except you will not get the super loot, instead your keystone will recharge or wait for the weekly reset. but you can still run dungeons with other people who have their keys still charged and get loot. so depleting your key ain't no biggy.

you also have a loot chest in your base of operations. this can only be opened once a week, how good the loot you get from it for that week depends on the highest level mythic+ dungeon you have completed within the week. at the start of the next week, it resets."
"I agree that porn is anything designed to elicit sexual arousal. You can’t know what the intention of an Instagram poster was, but you can make a reasonable assumption based on the content as to whether it’s pornographic. However, it’s possible to look at something designed to be pornographic and not view it for the purpose it was intended for. If I watch porn made for people with foot fetishes, I’m not going to become aroused, as it just doesn’t do anything for me. However, it’s still pornographic content, even though I may be watching it out of curiosity. I could be watching for research, and I wouldn’t consider that to be me “watching porn” even though I would be *objectively* “watching porn” - because I didn’t watch it to get myself aroused, and I didn’t become aroused.  
So, based on that, I’d say that it’s totally possible to look at salacious Instagram posts and just appreciate the photo in other ways. I’d say it’s unlikely that a heterosexual man is going to look at provocative photos of a conventionally attractive woman and view them in some other way, though..."

"&gt; Not if you want the math to work... 

We've definitely made changes. Some old number sets had 0, some didn't. Derivatives are relatively newer. Negatives and imaginaries aren't a thing in nature at all, but we use them.

&gt; Take a word like cat. In Arabic it's قَطُّ (qaṭṭu). Both the English word and the Arabic word independently relate to words for ""cutting""; قَطُّ can mean both ""a cat"" and ""to carve; to cut, to trim, to clip, to pare; to sharpen a nib, pencil"". This is intrinsic to their (meta-)etymologies, because cutting is intrinsic to the nature of cats. It is no coincidence that the words for ""cat"" and ""cut"" sound the same in English, even though there is no direct etymological descent, and that the same applies in Arabic. 

Etymology says otherwise on the English one and the Arabic— both come from other roots, and there's no evidence of anything to do with cutting.

&gt; Yeah, fair enough. But that's why I said you don't have the choice. You are being forced to be an apatheist.

I disagree. If there's a god, regardless of its nature, I care. 

&gt; Snakes and dragons. Perhaps the most ancient archetypes in mythology. 

Satan is most commonly linked to serpents in the NT, which is Christian. OT's only reference to an evil serpent that I'm aware of is the Garden of Eden snake, but that's not confirmed to be Satan at all. Judaism has Satan the accuser and prosecutor, and that's not the same as Satan in Christianity.

&gt; There is indeed a harmful agenda that omits this and doesn't discuss this. It would hate for people to realize that the world is ""made out of language"", because that would make them question their programming. The fact people are ignorant in regards to this also allows pseudo-historiography to push the false agenda that ""genetics don't reveal cultural background"", even when it's so obvious to a critical thinker that genes would simply not survive without given modes of being that become expressed through cultural inheritance unique to the corresponding genetic patterns.

Programming implies a programmer, for which I see no evidence. 

&gt; Warfare and all these things have meta-physical natures. Like how spears and bows were invented independently. For that reason Arabic قوس (qaws) means ""arch"" as well as ""bow"" (used in hunting or wars), as is the case with Latin arcus. And then even the use of the sounds q (or c in Latin) and s is (more or less) predetermined (or optimally adequate -- at least in the respective culture). 

I'm not getting your point here.

&gt; Some names and words have Greek and Latin roots, but they are not original. Alex goes back to what is behind the PIE reconstruction h₂lek-, which actually has to do with łęk or łuk (""bow"" -- weapon), as well ług (""bog"" -- place strategic in defense and in hiding, a sanctuary); ślęczeć (""to drudge [at]"") and hundreds of other closely related words. The Slavic language group better describes these relations and provides more of them. Greek and Latin just focus on a small subset and/or are ""all over the place"", as if these languages were developed very fast through a sort of ""orphaning"" and ""adoption"" -- which they were. The She-wolf (Proto-Slavic ""adopter"") that raised Remus and Romulus (Proto-Italic ""orphans"") represents this mythologically in the case of Latin.

It means ""to protect"", not ""bow"" or ""weapon""... I'm really not sure where you're getting this one.

&gt; Doubtful you would if you knew my methodology. Plus it's even dangerous and illegal for me to suggest you do the things I'd have to suggest (and illegal for you to perform them). 

Depends on the process. I'm open to it if it's not illegal where I'm at and won't kill me. If I have to get higher than a kite, though, I'm going to pass."

"If you want to get pedantic: there is no such thing as ""standard Ethernet"". While the Ethernet spec specifies a minimum tolerance for copper physical medium, the actual medium is not specified. Yes, in high-quality devices, the individual data pairs should be galvanically isolated. This, however, is also not part of the standard. Allowing for low-quality devices, a connection made directly to a PC NIC, the high likelihood of shielding given an overland, building-to-building connection, and the fact that the cable is clearly having an electrical effect beyond the two connected ports, I didn't feel it necessary to write an electrical dissertation. Also, I never claimed that ""Ethernet connections form electrical coupling"", meerly that fiber is preferred for exactly this reason."

"People really shouldn’t be commenting on what size vent penetrations should be. It’s different sizing for different reasons in different areas. 

Colder areas need to increase pipe size to protect from hoar frost choking the air in the pipe. 

When I was in Ontario, it was 3”. Now in Alberta, 4”. When I visited Florida, 1 1/2”. 

If your job is being inspected, I would listen to your plumber because a fail or pass inspection is reliant on the flashing size, he doesn’t want to come back and fix it later. There might be a new plumbing code in your area that the roofing guys are not aware of, but the plumber is. 
If not being inspected I don’t really see much difference between a 1 1/2” pipe or 2” pipe (in my opinion). 

Maybe taking a walk outside and looking at your neighbours pipe penetrations will give you some clarity. "

"Don't play with absurd level PCs.

Min/maxing at high levels can work both ways.  While REF Defenses can certainly get high for everyone a dedicated attacker can also boost attack values to keep up.  If that doesn't work bringing in some additional help (Aid Another) can make up the difference and can various de-buffer types.  While Evasion can negate this using AoE attacks can still have damage getting through despite ""untouchable"" REF Defense scores plus you can start looking for attack modes that target things other than REF Defense.

You ""expected"" REF for a 20th level hero is probably something like 10 base +20 level +3 class + some misc like DEX bonus and then actual booster from other resources.  An expected attack value from a full BAB character is d20 +20 BAB + other modifiers from ability scores and other feats/talents.  The chances of hitting do go down a little from the earliest levels but they are still close to 40%.  Now your character who isn't so focused on attacking may have a terrible BAB and little to boost that but then they should be looking at other ways to ""win"" the encounter that shouldn't need to involve directly attacking someone with a sky high REF Defense."

"No division does well when there is little belief that anyone can beat the champ. The UFC Flyweight divison has been in that spot for nearly 5 years.

This was even worse in Flyweight because Dana didn't even like the champ of the divison. 

People do like smaller fighters, just look at boxing. Guys like Lomachenko are fan favourites. UFC fans don't care about the smaller divisions because the UFC doesn't want them to. If DJ can't be put on a pedestal by the UFC then none of the others have a chance either.

"The basic market failure in the used car market is that there's information asymmetry.   The guy selling the used car knows if there's something wrong with it, and is much more likely to try to sell his car right before it breaks down completely if he can.   So when you buy a used car, you know there's a significant chance you're buying a car with something terribly wrong with it that isn't obvious, and that lowers the value of the car to you.     Because of that basic information asymmetry, even if you're selling a perfectly good used car, the value is less because the buyer can't be sure it is a  good used car."

"To add on, there are 2 types of chrono builds. The DPS variant uses berserker equipment and bring lots of phantasm skills to deal damage. The support variant uses some commanders gear, sigil of concentration, and bring wells and signet of inspiration to buff the squad.

"Girl. I will attest to this. This is my life. I spent years feeling like I was broken—I took supplements,  had blood tests, went to counseling, had scheduled sex, bought toys—none of it worked. I had to listen to him complain about lack of sex even though we averaged 3 times a week—absolute duty sex. He never cared if I was satisfied. I felt like I was asexual, which was not who I was prior to my marriage. Then my husband cheated on me and got caught, so I left him. 

I’m now dating an amazing new guy and sex is on my mind 24/7. The flame that was once snuffed out is like a 4 alarm fire. This man makes me feel so fucking alive when he touches me. I feel like a person again, not just a bang-maid. I can’t imagine going back to sex with my ex husband. Cannot. Will not.

"One of my finance managers ditched his Hellcat for a Gt2 Stinger, he is a die hard car guy but loved the package of the Kia enough to make the switch.

With Stingers leasing in the 300-400 mark now loaded it's a sleek looking vehicle with adequate power and a killer warranty. Not the worst choice.

Buying one? I ditched my Hellcat for a Tacoma a few weeks ago but I didn't cross shop them. Everyone buys for different reasons so resale may not matter to someone who wants a low mileage lease on the newest sporty hatch having car on the market.

Sorry your coworker is a tool, he'd probably be a tool in a 911 or a Civic Si. Try a Stinger sometime if you get the chance, it's not the second coming of christ but it's a darn good car."

"Here's the key: forgiveness. Not for your abusers sake, for your own sake. For emotional healing. How to do it?

Sit down in a comfortable place in your home where it is quiet and you won't be disturbed. Time to meditate. Back up straight but comfortable, chin level, eyes closed. If you believe in prayer, say a prayer, it will help you. Take some deep breaths, relax. Picture the time that is most painful for you at this moment. Imagine you are stepping into your shoes at that time, and time is frozen. 

Now you can say, curse, scream, cry at your abuser, anything you feel you need to say. Let it all out. When you are done, say from your heart, ""I forgive you."" And ask them for forgiveness too, for any pain you caused them. (Not that your abuse is your fault, mind you.) Let that memory go, picture an energetic cord that connects your heart to that memory or person. Then make a motion like you are cutting the cord. Let the ends of the cord go down to the Earth. Breathe... When you are ready, open your eyes, notice your feelings and thoughts, you are done for now. Try this everyday, with any memories that feel painful to you still.

Forgiveness does not mean ""what you did is okay"", or ""I deserve abuse"". It means ""I understand we are both human beings, and we make mistakes. If I were in your shoes, I may have done the same thing. I understand the dark side in you is the same dark side that is in me."" I hope that makes sense, and I pray that it helps you find relief.

If you want to talk, send me a chat or PM. I'll try to always respond!"

"The revenue would not exist If the tax credits were not available. You realize this is a new business and no previous tax was collected? Also, let's be honest here.

Is this like when oil spill happened and some rednecks came up with the idea of using hay to absorb oil. Sure it works in a container with small surface area but were talking seas and oceans. Why not just collect plastics world wide and properly recycle it and punish severely companies that knowingly pollute the evironment. Mandatory prison for life to all the heads of a company that gives orders to bypass safety regulations because they want to save a few bucks. Do that and problem goes on its own. Also sink or confiscate every boat that does illegal fishing.

"My point was that people with insurance tend to abuse it. You don't need to go to the doctor for every single bump and bruise or stomach ache but people do and that drives up premiums for everyone. Insurance should be for emergencies and accidents, just like car insurance. For non emergencies people would have to shop around and hospitals would be forced to display prices and compete with each other since insurance wouldn't cover it. Try it yourself, walk into a hospital and ask what the price of a strep throat test is. They won't be able to tell you because they don't know, they just charge insurance whatever they want. Then insurance companies have to drive up premiums to make up for it. It's basic human nature that when someone else is paying you tend to spend more."

"Second this. The only universal way to debug ""simple"" code is to know what that code should be doing, and comparing it against what it is actually doing. Unit tests suggested elsewhere doesn't help you here, because you already know there's a bug, you just needed to find where it was.

In general you should write short concise code and check often, you should never go more than 10-20 lines without checking what your code is doing. That way when something goes wrong you can say for certain which 10-20 lines caused it. From there it's a matter of running through the lines and comparing the expected output to the actual output."

"There's a few photos online that show you what instruments take up what frequencies. In my experience, if you have too many instruments that sound well in the same frequency they all mush together. One of the keys in current production IMO is that those 4-5 instruments that producers use all have their own frequency spectrum that they control. For example; a string quartet. Two violins, a viola and a cello, although they sound very similar, they all take up different frequency spectrums (violins are usually midrange to highs, violas are low mids, cellos are lows/ ""subs""). I think where you should start is looking for instruments that all take up their own frequency spectrum. I know online there's a millions photos people use as desktops showing what instruments take up what spectrumsand use that as a road map for prodution. 

Once you start moving things out of place is where it gets hairy, then comes heavy EQ, etc. 

at the end of the day, chose instruments that shine in a specific frequency and Keep them there, don't worry about adjusting them after that. Not sure if this helps, but it helped me a while ago. "

"There have been a few American close calls. One of the most frightening happened in 1979 when a training scenario was mistakenly loaded into the wrong computer, leading to folks at NORAD believing that a full scale Soviet ICBM launch against the US had occurred. The error was determined when confirmation of the launches was sought via satellite and radar systems.

In 1960 a radar station in Greenland mistook the moonrise for a full scale Soviet attack. One reason for doubting the data was that the Soviet Premier (Khrushchev) was currently visiting New York. If the error had happened some other time who knows what might have happened.

In 1961 NORAD lost contact with several BMEWS (Ballistic Missile Early Warning System) sites. Since the communication lines with all those sites were supposed to be heavily redundant, this seemed like a very high confidence sign of a preemptive attack. Though it turned out the system was not *quite* as redundant as they thought it was.

In 1965 during the great Northeast Blackout several nuclear bomb detectors malfunctioned and indicated that cities had been destroyed by atomic weapons.

There have also been some other related incidents. For example, the most important bit of the ""nuclear football"" is just a 3x5 card with authentication codes printed on it. President Reagan preferred to carry that card in a pocket of his jacket (as did Carter). When Reagan was shot and taken to the hospital the card was lost track of when medical personnel cut off his clothes to treat his wounds, the card was later found tucked into one of his shoes left on the floor of the emergency room.

(There are several others as well, which I won't list here.)

It's hard to say exactly how close these close calls were without having greater knowledge of the precise nature of all of the nuclear command and control facilities, organizational structure, and processes, many of which remain classified to this day. My gut tells me that none of these were really all *that* close, as in general there were easy sanity checks that led people toward the correct conclusions that WW3 had not actually already started. However, one has to wonder. How would things have turned out if a different administration was in power, or if certain incidents had happened during more tense times, or if coincidental incidents had happened at the same time? For example, if the Northeast Blackout and erroneous signal of a nuclear attack had happened during the Cuban Missile Crisis instead of in 1965, would it have escalated?

"Don't feel bad AT ALL that she was not paid in money.

When I was around your age, anyone I knew would kill for a gig like this.  Everyone was living with parents or roommates and were happy to get a place for their own for a bit.  Besides just doing the job we agreed to do, we also did a great job hoping to be asked again in the future.

She was asked to house-sit, agreed to the terms, and HAS NOT DONE THE JOB!

Make her clean up.  Help, if necessary, because you recommended her and because you don't want your parents to have to come Home to this.

She can never house-sit again.  You have to have a talk/apology with your parents.  I know they know and trusted her, too, as an old friend of yours.  They'll probably be as surprised as you.  Just all get on the same page that she's not to be trusted again.  

side notes:  I do wonder if living with her parents still has left her lacking some basic life skills.  But at 23 she should still realize To Take the F-ing Garbage out.  Presumably she's also been to your parents house before.  Leave thing as you found them or better!

You also mention boyfriend as perhaps a bad influence.  Tough Luck.  They got a two month free Fck-Palace and couldn't water the plants in exchange.  And if she's that dumb to go along with him being a SLOB in her old Friend's PARENT'S house...  Nope, no way.  You are responsible for your guests.  You make them clean up or you clean up after them.

These side notes are also things you can discuss with her.  While deciding how good a friend she is, after all.  It can also be a wake-up call for her, if she's really that clueless.  As an old friend, I'd have a talk with her after your parents got home.  Use her responses as a gauge for future friendship-level.  

ps All my friends who house-sat were awesome and got asked back (a bunch of us all recommended each other if we couldn't do it).  When I got my first own place, some of my friends were still with roommates and always did a great job house- and pet-sitting.  In fact, I was kinda sad when eventually everyone had their own places and I had to look elsewhere for vacation pet-care.

But by then you've found Good Neighbors to trade off with!

TLDR;  Chalk this one up, get straight with your parents, and re-evaluate your friendship."

"the difference is Romo can break down plays in 10 seconds for the casual viewer eloquently

Romo is like a great professor, who understands how to explain complex subjects to the average person. Other players are just great students that know how to do something but could never explain it to a person with minimal knowledge on the subject. 

Edit: also most NFL players have been learning/studying football since hs. Their entire life is devoted to football, so it's not a shock that they can talk about it forever. But there are very few players that have Romo's ability and knowledge to dissect everything on the field."

Badminton is simply not a viable career choice for most people.

"I know this sub likes to preach everything in moderation, and I do feel like if you can, that's probably the most sustainable method, long term. However, for me, I am like a carb/sugar addict. I seem to rarely have a ""full"" response, even when others around me have had their fill. I love food, and even though my meals would generally be good, nutritious food, I was always craving snacks in between, or grabbing breakfast sandwiches because I was running too late, or treating myself with a dinner out. Right now I feel like I just can't have some of those things because I can't stop.

I'm currently following fairly closely the whole30 eating guidelines, while calorie counting. I have found it mind boggling how nonexistent my appetite is while eating this way. I eat when it's time to eat, and I enjoy my food because I cook delicious meals, but in between I just don't think about food. I find it's so freeing, and I have almost never felt this way about food before. For me the hard boundaries/rules make it much easier to say no to stuff and just focus on the meals I've planned for the week.

YMMV, I dunno if this is the case for other people, but just thought I'd share. The guidelines are basically no added sugar of any kind (including sugar substitutes), no dairy, no grains, no alcohol, no legumes, and limited preservatives. Basically eating meat, veggies, fruit, and nuts/seeds (no peanuts though, as they're legumes)."

People often do exactly the same thing with human infants, who are not yet complex enough to have much of their own personality.  Sure they have different experiences and this can shape the way they behave, but I don't see how this makes them special.  "

It's fine tho, I don't blame most Finnish people to be like actually racist tho, they might be a bit ignorant and without even knowing inconsiderate.

There are, however, some people who really have a problem with immigrants or minority Finns. Thank god at least the younger generation is a bit better and more open minded. My dad used to tell me that 25 years ago he nearly got axed by a skin head for parking his car next to his, so I definitely think it's improved. I just wish it hadn't affected me and my sense of self when growing up, because I would hate myself and the country that I truly feel to be my own. 

I used to be really into proving to everybody that I was a Finn through and through, but nowadays it isn't the case. You can take me from Finland, but Finland doesn't leave me. I love the nature, the ideology of Finland, there's nothing that I have to compare it with, but also I allow myself to be able to criticise and choose accordingly. Being multicultural means that I have the means and options to better the society and contribute to it in ways that maybe traditionally might have not been thought about.

"There's a simple not all that lore heavy reason for this. Pitched battles are obviously very different to simply ambushing your enemy and then rushing through their gates to overwhelm them. The Hist literally saw into the future of course they were going to have an advantage, especially when they then mutated them into mini-godzillas. I don't really understand where your confusion comes from. They blitzkrieg'd the Oblivion gates, whilst being unnaturally enhanced, which overwhelmed the daedra so they closed the gates to halt the blitzkrieg. Obviously if Dagon wasn't stopped by Martin they would have tried again, this time knowing the Argonians will be expecting them and thus planning for that. You're seriously overlooking the fact that the Hist used fuckin pre-cognition and how amazing of an advantage that would be.

As for their historical attempts at historical warfare, a pitched battle (with complex tactics, strategies, supply lines etc) featuring a loose coalition of inexperienced independent tribes (some of whom have stone age technology) fighting a literal standing army of professional soldiers is obviously going to result in the tribes losing - especially when those tribes are in unfamiliar territory. The only time Argonians did categorically well at offensive warfare was when they used similar blitzkrieg tactics to overrun the unsuspecting Dunmer who were already in crisis and by the time they sacked their way to Mournhold, Redoran were able to assemble a force to repel them. The tactics that have consistently worked well for them in offensive conflicts clearly stem from their excellence in stealthy ambushes and guerrilla warfare. "

"It is increasingly obvious that China is not interested in easing the Trade War.

The U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, was repeatedly insulted by Beijing during his China visit earlier this month.

His request to meet with Pooh Bear was refused.

He only had a **one hour** meeting with  Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who spent most of the hour attacking the U.S. for  ‘ceaselessly escalating’ trade tensions.

At the joint meeting with journalists after the meeting, he openly continued his insulting attacks (which is definitely not protocol).

And then possibly one of the biggest insults and a great sign of disrespect, Wang Yi did not take Pompeo to dinner after the meeting.

This reminds me of the old days when the pig-ignorant emperor of China refused to meet high-level delegations from foreign countries, and indeed sometimes had them tortured and murdered. These actions eventually culminated in the so-called Opium Wars where China was put in its rightful place.

I wonder if there will be similar results this time?

It's a shame that you've worked in the industry for so long and don't actually know what [PMI is](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/the-basics-of-private-mortgage-insurance-pmi.aspx)...

&gt; For conventional loans, private mortgage insurance acts a protector — but for lenders, not for borrowers. If you default on your loan, PMI makes sure lenders get their money.

It doesn't protect home-owners, it protects the companies that hold the notes on your home.  PMI is a completely different thing than home-owners insurance.  Frankly, it's bullshit.  If they want to hedge on your mortgage, they either need to pay for their own insurance or perhaps raise the standards at which they will lend."

"Jesus Christ the jerk is strong here

Yes pretty much every football player has the same knowledge that Romo presents on TV.  Maybe they couldn't deliver it as succinctly, accessibly, or as enthusiastically, but no NFL quarterback would learn anything by listening to a Romo broadcasted game

Take a receiver for example.  It's not enough to know what route you're running, you have to know what options are built in, you have to know what concept your play is running, what defense it's supposed to attack.  It's not enough to beat the DB covering you, you have to know what their coverage is, if you stay on a man beating route or if you're sitting down in a zone.  You have to watch the linebackers and safeties to see if someone is blitzing that wasn't expected so you can adjust to a hot route

RB's have to read defenses to know which gaps to hit, they have to run routes and learn complicated pass protection rules

Rumor had it that a few here and there would voluntarily stop having kids and claim infertility or that God had 'closed their womb' as an excuse, but generally speaking most understand their role upon pledging and that's just the end of it. Another few actually left Quiverfull and at that point stopped having children. One family we grew up with had 10 miscarriages and at that point proactively stopped trying. The situations varied, but by in large everyone submits to the doctrine."

I have also had tanks that never seemed to have any issues.  There are just too many variables, the bio-load is always changing, and expensive things will happen.  "

"Here's mine: There was this family at my old church that was very good friends with my family. Their daughter was good friends with my older sister. They also had an older son (\~mid 20s). He, as well as the parents and daughter were really chill, nice people.

Due to life circumstances, we had to discontinue going to church. I remember just sitting and watching TV and all of a sudden, the son's **mugshot** is on display for all to see. The news dropped his name and everything! He was arrested for holding up an Amtrak with a firearm. He did no harm, but, like, wtf? And that's not all. It turns out, according to searches in his apartment and electronics, he had been reading a lot of Neo-Nazi and White Supremacist literature. He had possession of an abnormal amount of firearms. He attended the Charlottesville riot in Virginia. And the last thing he did was randomly point a gun at a black woman while driving down the road whilst yelling out racial slurs. 

He's in jail now, so we don't have to worry about him anymore. But, it's crazy, cause for so long, he seemed like a really normal and chill dude, and out of nowhere, I see his mugshot and a list of criminal acts he's done."

"Why do you think that getting into ketosis is faster with dry fasting vs water fasting? The body isn't going to magically work faster or better by avoiding water, a needed ingredient for many bodily functions.

IMO, a viable way would be to eat a diet containing very low carbs for a few days prior to your fast. Then you are already in ketosis before starting your fast."

You seem to be worried about things out of your control. All you can do is stick to a diet that makes sense and work out. If it doesn't go exactly to plan, learn from it and move on. 

This isn't a race. See what works. For me, lifting is to take away the anxiety of not looking good, and seeing what I would like to improve upon in a positive fashion.

"They keep talking about having a universal database of firearm registrations, transactions, etc but I don't think they understand how complicated that actually is.  How many thousands of data entry points?  The sheer volume of transactions of a daily/weekly/basis.  Does it include address information for buyer/seller/owners?  If so, how is that maintained?  People move an awful fucking lot.  What measures would be necessary to maintain the integrity of data?

&amp;#x200B;

My home state of Missouri has trouble doing this sort of shit with cars -- and cars are already a thing that the state grants registration.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding reporting of stolen guns, ok, that sounds reasonable.  But let's look deeper, shall we?  What are the penalties for not reporting?  For not reporting within a specific period of time?  I own a few guns but I might go months or years without seeing/using any gun other than my daily carry gun.  It could be a long time before I notice when one of those guns gets stolen.  Does this ""law"" now require me to store my guns in a particular manner? (i.e. locked, in a safe, etc).  If so, is my carry or ""pillow"" gun allowed to not be stored in that manner for easy access at night?

If we're going to do this shit for guns, then they gotta add in the same sort of shit for prescription medicine ""in order to help combat the opioid epidemic"".  Restrict my rights and I'll restrict yours.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding gun seizures, what is the process to regain one's guns?  As much as they might hate guns, gun ownership is a right that is specifically called out in the Constitution and as such it should be treated as a temporary thing with the expectation that the rights will be restored as soon as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

If we're going to go down this road, then, pun intended, we should also be so quick to seize vehicles from people too.  If you're too unstable to own a gun you shouldn't be on the road.

&amp;#x200B;

If one of our enumerated rights is now restricted until the age of 21, then are all of our enumerated rights restricted to that age also?  Like would voting be restricted until the age of 21 also?  I would love to see the legal basis for making that determination of which age is entitled to what right...

Is it really that big an issue that console gets it slightly later? If it is then you can freely create a pc account if you felt the need to. But being realistic it isn’t.

Sea of thieves is a much much simpler game than Warframe, Warframe relies on its constant content update, and hotfixes, they cannot do that on console because of the certification procedure, which takes weeks of time and costs money each time.

Just look at all the issues DE has had /still has to fix since the new elite alert update, console players would be more pissed off being told they will have to wait another month or so to have it fixed "

"Marissa skidded to a stop outside of a room marked **Records** in bold stenciling. She trained her weapon on the doorway as she lined up a hard kick to break the lock. 

""Cover me."" Marissa barked. She took a step and delivered a kick that snapped the cheap lock holding the door closed.

""Get the fuck down!"" She began screaming as soon as she entered the room. A surprised middle aged looking man looked up from the files he was about to start burning.  

Marissa charged him, smashing him against the wall with a hard shoulder check.  He clocked her in the jaw with a desperate punch, making the operator see stars.

One spell damage is about one mana (see the 4 mana 2/2 kobold with spell dmg 2. Two spell dmg is a crocolisk worth of stats) and this bundles it all together. 2 mana for raw stats and the hero power can be quite powerful as well. Make this 5/6 mana.

In my last 2 years of high school, I was working 3 jobs and had a couple of other athletic activities such as Tae Kwon Do in which I was putting a lot of time and effort in so I could test for my black belt on top of standard school hours.

If something extra like ""volunteering"" was thrown in there then it'd have to be something I could do at midnight(but hey, who needs sleep?)

Though after seeing some of the stuff people were able to get signed off on, I could probably have gotten a boss or coach or my Tae Kwon Do instructor to sign off on some or all of those hours.  Hell, they would have had too.

"The best thing I think for you to do is to take some time figuring out what would make you happy with/respect yourself just being you, not dependent upon another person for your happiness.  

Firstly, if you're not happy just being you, you'll be a drain upon anyone you'd be with.  Secondly, if your happiness is dependent upon another person, then it can be taken away at their whim.  By forming your own identity with a strong foundation, if chaos were to come your way, you don't stop being you just because events happen.  Avoid having a one-dimensional identity, so that if something happens in one area of your life, your entire sense of self doesn't crumble beneath you.  

It's important that you re-evaluate your goals for yourself fairly regularly, especially if you seem to be stumbling on the initial attempts.  Nothing is set in stone and you may have to take a different path to get where you want to be.

As for where to start:

* Try to identify unhealthy habits and either remove or minimize them in your life.  (drinking/drugs, eating too much sugar, not getting enough sleep, ...)
* If you are unfit, lifting may get you some fulfillment, you'll have to decide what you actually want in this arena.  (General fitness, Do you like the outdoors:  running/hiking/biking, Rock climbing, body-builder, endurance training,...)
* Continue improving your mind through study;  Philosophy, Psychology, Economics, History, really whatever interests you and may help you understand the world you live and interact with.  The more you understand the system the less surprised by events within the system you may be.

&amp;nbsp;

Career Goals: 

If you're in College pursuing a degree, some questions you need to ask yourself: 

* Do you really like the subject matter?  
* Is this a career field or a hobby you'd want to pursue?  
* What are the current job market prospects for this field now and what is the projection for when you'd graduate?
* Do you have the knack for it, or the drive to work as hard as it takes to be a subject matter expert.

If you've answered negatively to the questions, or it's more of a hobby, or no job prospect, YOU NEED TO RETHINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE!  Seriously, if it's more of hobby, pursue a career and let the career pay for your pursuit of the hobby in the future.  If there are no job prospects your degree will be worthless, and if you don't care about job prospect, then it's a hobby.

If you're still in High-school:

If you don't know what you'd like to do yet, no problem.  A lot of us were there in the same boat.  Do not be afraid of the skills trades or manual labor, they'll earn you good money that you can save for later investment into what you want to do.  Whether that be a college degree or more advanced Trade Schools/Certifications.  

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry for the general information, if it doesn't assist you it may assist someone else.  You didn't really tell us what your situation is for more tailored advice/suggestions.  Good luck on your path of self improvement!"

"Have you played Subnautica?

What you have just described is basically Subnautica. It is incredible and absolutely terrifying, especially at the beginning when you first start exploring the depths.

I have never had to fight myself so hard to progress a game like I did in Subnautica. Going deeper and deeper proves to be an incredible test of willpower.

The sub creaks as the pressure builds. Socked in by all encompassing darkness, you push on, with every fiber in your body screaming at you to surface. *THUMP.* What was that sound? Was it just your submersible adjusting to the pressure? Was it a small fish? You kill the lights on your vessel to avoid the risk of being seen by something... large. You sit in silence, ears perked for anything that sounds strange. Only the sound of your heart pounding in your ears occupies the quiet submersible, until... a deep roar emirates from the depths below and pierces the silence.

You hit the lights, fucking *smash* that throttle, and race for the surface before you lose your sanity. Cue spending the next 20 minutes summoning the courage and gathering the resources and fuel to go deeper yet again.

&amp;#x200B;

Highly recommend it."

If it's getting to a point where talon needs this rune to kill someone at 50% HP odds are they're about to die to something else anyways.

Can it come in clutch? Probably...but it's way more hit or miss in comparison to electrocute I think.
The lane trades and roam priority are probably worth more than ksing late game.

If talon gets ahead: this rune is not useful because enemies will be one shot
If talon is behind: there won't be many opportunities to proc it
Basically I think it's super niche and probably a lot more useful on champions with reliable aoe like a Miss Fortune 

Talon top will benefit more than talon mid but the whole gimmick of talon top is to not stay in lane anyways so meh."

"You're implying that they fully intended to release these exact things from the start and nothing is a new idea? You're crazy. You're basically saying that if they don't have these ideas at the start then they can never release them unless they want to work for free.

If somebody told me that all my future creations had to be free just because somebody bought an earlier creation they're based on I'd tell them to go fuck themselves, it's an incredibly naive and entitled attitude to think you deserve constant free updates to a one of purchase that was perfectly 'finished' at release. The Stellaris team have been incredibly kind with their free content to be honest, I'd say they could even have more of the features they release behind paid DLC and be justified. You paid one time for a game that gives you major updates at least twice a year and you still fucking complain.

When people buy the base game of Stellaris they are paying for that, not the new work they've been doing. What's the point in making a game if you have to put the profit you make into releasing new content for zero return?"

"I think you could approach this as measuring and finding outliers in productivity. A simple you could do this is to use a value metric over time. These are salespeople, so let's say the value metric is their gross sales. You can then divide by their working days to define productivity. Then, anyone who has a high (top 10% for example, or standard deviation from the mean) sales per day is a good employee, and those who have low productivity get coaching. 

This scheme also corrects for vacation (less sales and fewer days) and seasonality (if everyone has fewer sales than the mean is different). You can also slice the metric across relevant populations as needed (ie each region gets measured separately)"

The problem is that every time a cop sneezes people complain. Saying he could have done a better job. While they don't understand the situation. That why the police just stand there. If the try to move the people some dumbass is going to say that the police were trying to stop their right to protest. This is something the police can easily fix but i don't think they will because of how much hate they already have to deal with. And if you allow people to drive through then every protest will be a small purge. I think the best thing to do is make it against the law to protest on major road ways.

"Revenue recognition is specifically tested thoroughly for fraud by every auditor on every company that requires an audit under GAAS/PCAOB. What you’re implying is that Tesla and its auditors are committing one of the largest scale accounting frauds since SOX was issued.

Note that timing of revenue recognition on delivery of physical goods as simple and traceable as vehicles is incredibly easy to test and document. If the auditors specifically overlooked this, it would be incredibly easy for them to get caught and lose their licenses.

Edit: I forgot to mention - while Q3 results are unaudited, it’s customary to begin interim audit testing during the Q3 review, so these types of shenanigans would have been uncovered nearly instantly."

My actual degrees are in English Literature, which I'm using as a freelance translator. Your emphasis makes your degree more employable than the topics you mention in the degree, because those are actually fields that a lot of people work in. Generic sociology is employable, but there are so many graduates! Would not be surprised even the slightest bit if there were more jobs available in your field in Germany than where you are.

But with all due respect to your degree, sports writing sounds so very very much more fun and interesting (working for the UN and such can be such a downer - I translate for UNHRC, but those are just the most positive stories). Just my opinion as the average nerd, who grew up playing handball, football, going skiing (Norway), then added rollerblading, snowboarding, went over to martial arts (all of them, but mostly kung fu), dance (mainly salsa, but again everything) and then powerlifting/fitness. Hell, I even played disc golf! So nope, I'm completely neutral when I say sports are interesting!"

"I was talking about double rolled assassin gear earlier, and here are my examples: (Also Assassin damage is lower than I thought, at 101k.)

https://imgur.com/a/i05f3HA

I had one more piece than I thought. So, two of these pieces, the weapons, have irrelevant second slot engravings. But the damage loss from taking away the second assassin damage roll makes them both still the best weapons I have at the moment. The spear is basically a stat stick.

The other two are ideal rolls. Both have double rolled assassin, as well as crit chance, and apparently the gear drop I was wondering about *does* exist and you can add crit damage on top of this, and I'm just a super forgetful person. I've been rolling with the headshot engraving on the bow just so I can snipe out mooks with Ghost of Artemis as needed, but this can also be changed to crit damage.

The more Assassin and crit mods you have, the better chance you'll have to one-shot just about everything you come across."

I'd think you'd want some kind of water, but no transparency and no high frequency detail. Really smooth simple waves, like no gerstner or anything. I'm thinking thick and gloopy; it's not that much different than water but it is a little, so I think you could try to exaggerate that. Could you add froth at the top edges or some other visual cue. Stripy bent straw for a chimney?

"Samui is a very touristy place and the locals are really mostly only looking for cash.  Sadly not a lot of trinkets you could bring from America that they would either be interested in or they can't get cheaper over there (where most of that stuff is made anyway).

"I somewhat agree, but consider that due to our greed, we progress in the world because we want to be better than others or gain/achieve something(generally). 

For example, if the primary focus of an entrepreneur is to make money, then he or she has to satisfy needs of consumers. Therefore, if customers demand sustainability and the entrepreneur comes with a great sustainable new car such as Tesla, he creates an better environment while fulfilling his own needs which is money. 

In other words, as long as we the consumers demand products/services which are good for society, the planet and is sustainable, companies will produce those as it is the only way to make money (if they don't we don't buy them etc). However, currently people are often to short sighted to understand that if they keep on buying goods/services which are not from sustainable sources such as: Coca Cola (ruining water sources), Shell(emissions) Volkswagen(emission scandal), we will never improve the world.

That being said, I cannot say I am not a hypocrite, I do prefer cheaper goods to save money over more expensive goods to save the environment.. On which I can only responds people to a certain extend are greedy and self centered, but we do mean well as long as it is not to inconvenient for ourselves. 

You could see it as capitalistic consumer democracy (just made that up), as we the consumer can demand with our purchases that companies start producing sustainable goods or whatever that we demand, or go bust because we the consumer don't buy their products. Therefore, with every dollar that we (majority of consumers) spends, we decide which company survives and which don't.

The argument that rich people can influence this is for the majority of products not true. Because a rich person is only going to buy a limited amount of products, a rich person does not need 100 Iphones, but 100 middle class people will. Therefore, if the middle class disagrees with a product and doesn't buy it it will certainly affect the companies.

"If they focuses fully on Deku-All Might relationship and AM as a character (strong, idealistic, superman-like but actually weakening and dying), it may just work. There isn’t that many superhero movies that brings up mentor-mentee relationship, and the recent few that does have been praised for it (Spiderman: Homecoming for example), and I don’t think a “weakening superman-type character” have been explored on movies. If they can roll these two into one, they may have a winning formula on their hands.

And Legendary is producing it, they have big budget and they have experience in making superhero movies, and not just any superhero movies but *highly acclaimed* superhero movies like The Dark Knight and Watchmen.

I'm taking my step brother to a local airport one evening, with my two sons in the backseat. He is much older and from the 60's and 70's muscle car era. He has had his fair share of classics. Anyways, on the way to the airport we stop at a light on a 3 lane road, i'm in right lane. A black Z06 pulls up next to me. I'm not even thinking about. There is 4 people in my car. Then a pickup pulls up in the left lane and starts yelling to the Z06, ""F*** that piece a shi* dodge up!!"" Light turns green and the Z06 skates away. My step brother and two sons yell ""Get him!!"" I lay into it and start bangin gears. By third I am next to him. I flip him the finger and romp on it again. He laid into the brakes and turns off. Next light the truck pulls up.

I told the truth and it cost me a position that I wanted so badly at work. I was even acting in the role, covering for people on vacation, and relied on since I knew how the role worked in-and-out. 



Once a year, we have what is known as *draft day*. All the managers get together and decide where to distribute staff members for the following year. Now, you get to email your manager your preferences, why you should go here/there/whatever. So naturally, I said I want to be at  said spot, as I have been basically in it for the last few months, etc etc. I was told after draft day was done that it wasn't official, but the spot was mine. 


Sweet


This was awesome for my family situation at the time, and my wife and I planned accordingly. Then I got a call from the manager's manager. He asked me if I was willing to commit myself the year after the following year to a position that is anything BUT what would work for my wife and I. I told him, honestly and truthfully, that no, I cannot do that because various reasons but mostly it would skyrocket my daycare costs.

I took it as a shoe in still, no reason as to why not.



Got a call a couple days later, booted back to a regular line staff. Despite my specialized training, my enthusiasm towards the position, my coverage of the post and everything that went along with that, they gave it to someone that had never even wanted the position. 



I went to talk to him about it, and I was mad so I didn't hold back. He refused to budge and I told him I didn't want to work in the department anymore. 


I found out later from my now new supervisor that it was because I told the truth I didn't get the job/position. He laughed and said ""LOL b0radb0rad, why didn't you just lie and say you would?""

I told the truth, and it cost me. I ended up leaving that place over it, because I felt that slighted by it. Then that upper manager got removed from the job, so I guess karma got him. "

I think one other important thing is being super open to lending help when it is requested. People shouldn’t feel bad about asking for help. "

"I saw a similar transition in a non-profit I worked at.  Sure, we weren't the best or most efficient or more ""corporate"" at doing things, but the people, especially frontline staff, were passionate about what they were doing (lots of social services, helping homeless teenagers, people on the verge of poverty, etc).  And then thing started to change.  The ""staff consultative group"" was dissolved.  The corporate services manager was replaced with someone to make things more ""efficient"".  One of the divisions was shut down because it wasn't profitable anymore.  We had similar games with training budgets (getting training approved as a do-er was impossible, while the executives went on endless workshops and training sessions).  In the first 12 months she was there, this new corporate services manager lost all 3 of her direct reports (IT, HR and Finance.  The finance manager had been there for 13 years).  It's truly sickening."

"KH1 Wonderland is one of the best worlds in the series, I was actually quite shocked to learn how hated it was and to this day don't quite understand why. It really set the bar high as the first Disney world we ever visit.

Lots of puzzles and secrets that involve interacting with the environment and use of magic outside of battle (an element which has been scarce to nonexistent since KH1), and the creative puzzle element of doing things in the gravity-shifting room on one wall which in turn can affect things on another and unlock things, as well as new stuff that can be discovered on subsequent playthroughs! I really will never understand how people hate this beast of a world, especially those that claim to 'want more puzzles'. Yes, there's confusion and the map doesn't really make sense with where openings lead so it's easy to get lost, but I feel like that was kind of the purpose being Wonderland and all."

For days, you'd see the little things scuttling around out of the corner of your eye. Like we'd be watching TV and a little crab would come out from under the book case or coffee table or something.

Maybe they really do have crabs living in the sink? If so, I'd suggest a lid of some sort. They can get out if you're not careful."

"I've been doing Teemo support since Season 4-5 I think. I got a few points I disagree with. 

But first I'd like to mention two points you seem to have ignored. Teemo is the best VISION-related champion in the game. What I mean by this is his shrooms work as 5 minute, heavy aoe damage, slowing, stealth revealing wards, with no limitations other than cooldown to how many you can put down. This is the core idea of a support Teemo. The second point of a support Teemo is brush control. I can't tell how many times people will ward a bush only to see me go invisible a second later. Then after dying they bring a pink to lane, use it on the brush, only to find out 10 seconds later that it doesn't reveal Teemo's stealth and they were incorrectly assumed I wasn't in the bush. This is a really strong mechanic and triggers the fuck out of people.

&gt; Next to no CC

No heavy CC, really strong soft-CC. Blind on a 40% CDR will take ADC's or AA reliant brusers out of the fight for a while. Plus slows.

&gt; Falls off

What the hell? He scales really well for the late game.

&gt; Gankable

Only pre-6. Once you put down 4-5 shrooms in lane at the same time ganking you is suicide.

&gt; Inherent lack of synergy due to being an unorthodox pick

Actually he goes really well with Caitlyn and Jhin because of traps and poke. Also goes well with ADC's that have an escape (Lucian, Tristana) because you can't peel for them other than your blind.

&gt; Very poor teamfighting, reliant on hitting combat-shrooms

Will depend on enemy composition. If they have Jax/Nasus/Vayne you're going to be a god."

"I was born and raised in Japan.  I am the other source. 

Obviously they must pick by the time they are 22.  I am very aware of that.  That doesn’t change the Japanese stance on dual nationality.

Im a multi-national myself and attended international school with dozens of dual-national Japanese + other Nationalities, all born before that cut-off year you posted.

It was and is common to keep your Japanese passport even when if the Japanese government disallows it.   So an American would keep his Japanese passport for coming back to Japan and use his American passport when entering the US.

If the government was so strict about it they could find all the dual nationals simply by demanding that data from airlines entering and leaving Japan (“Give is the list of all nationals entering and leaving on different passports, they are breaking the law.”)

So Japanese are skirting the law and this is well-known by the J-Gov.  However, a famous Japanese politician was recently outed for not having given up her second Taiwanese nationality and she played the “i forgot to give it up” card and was blasted in the media for it.  So if she was a famous person why wasn’t she given the right to keep her second nationality?  Because she didn’t pick by the time she was 22."

"## [🔗 Link para a notícia completa](https://outline.com/K7fZwk) 

 A ideia era dele. Desde 2016, após perder a eleição para a Prefeitura de São Paulo ainda no primeiro turno, Fernando Haddad (PT) decidiu que era preciso formar uma frente democrática para se contrapor à onda conservadora que tomava o país.

 O palco encontrado foi a disputa presidencial deste ano com Jair Bolsonaro (PSL).

 A três dias do segundo turno, porém, Haddad precisou se contentar com acenos tímidos de medalhões ou com o apoio de políticos menores.

 Após 15 dias tentando atrair, sem sucesso, Ciro Gomes (PDT) e [o ex-presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/haddad-telefona-a-fhc-e-diz-que-ataques-de-bolsonaro-colocam-democracia-em-jogo.shtml), o herdeiro de Lula recebeu declaração de voto de Marina Silva (Rede) e dos tucanos Jarbas Vasconcelos e Alberto Goldman.

 O apoio de Ciro era tido como natural, assim como o de Guilherme Boulos (PSOL), que fechou com o PT logo no início do segundo turno. Para Haddad, o ex-governador do Ceará não só subiria em seu palanque como participaria do comando de sua campanha. Mas o PDT anunciou ""apoio crítico"", e Ciro viajou à Europa.

 Depois do pedetista, a carga de Haddad se voltou a FHC, com quem nutre relação cordial desde antes da eleição.

 Mas o candidato demorou e o cronograma desandou. A porta que segundo FHC estava aberta se tornou ""enferrujada"", disse o ex-presidente.

 Os dois só se falaram após vir a público um vídeo de um dos filhos de Bolsonaro, Eduardo, falando de fechar o Supremo Tribunal Federal.

 A conversa não foi conclusiva, mas ambos fizeram uma avaliação de que a candidatura do capitão reformado ""ameaça a democracia"". O tucano, disse Haddad, demonstrou ""preocupação"" com o país.  
 Auxiliares do petista ainda esperam uma declaração explícita, mas a maior parte do PT acha o cenário improvável.

 A surpresa foi Marina Silva, considerada magoada com o partido —nas eleições de 2014, a campanha de Dilma Rousseff a atrelou a banqueiros e desidratou sua candidatura.

 A presidenciável da Rede teve 1% dos votos, mas seu apoio é simbólico, assim como os de Goldman e Jarbas, vozes de uma campo político diferente daquele dominado pelo PT.

 Dirigentes petistas criticam a tentativa de Haddad de atrair a centro-direita, e adversários exigem autocrítica do partido para dar apoio. A aparente contradição de buscar o centro e acenar ao eleitor pobre deve seguir até o minuto final.

 Preso em Curitiba, o arquiteto da candidatura, Lula, divulgou uma carta nesta quarta (24) para pedir a união dos democratas contra o que chama ade ""aventura fascista"".

"**Ear candling**

Ear candling, also called ear coning or thermal-auricular therapy, is an alternative medicine practice claimed to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow candle and placing the other end in the ear canal. Medical research has shown that the practice is both dangerous and ineffective and does not help remove earwax or toxicants.

For advertising, don’t write anything too explicit, of course lmao... for your photos, try to have a mixture of selfies (mostly selfies since many clients prefer these because it helps you appear more ‘real’ to them) and professional shots. Lingerie, heels, corsets, garter belts, fish nets stockings, dresses, skirts, thigh highs, etc are good to wear in your photos and tasteful nudity is a nice touch. Take your photos in different angles too 

Get on Twitter, Switter and Instagram if you want since there’s clients on social media too! Just gotta use the right hashtags and keep content fresh.

Denying the vast and ever-growing wealth of evidence makes creationism even more radical than it was just 25 years ago, because the pace of scientific discoveries (eg. images of the  origin of our universe from the Hubble Space Telescope, the human genome, detection of gravitational waves, etc.). Every study I’ve seen suggests that moderate, mainline Christianity is in decline. Yes, creationist churches today are a far cry from strict Calvinism, but they still believe in the Biblical story of creation and roughly the same historical timeline. "

Then we ended up leaving class together and he talked to me while I was walking and I had a different place to go then him since I live closer to the school while he doesn't. He lives an hr away and he kept prolonging the time to catch the train. He kept saying i'll leave in 5 minutes, then it became 10 minutes and I was lke don't you have a train to catch? and he was lke yeah ig i'll leave now. He added all his stuff on to my phone, and followed himself on socials. We had our usual friendly/flirty banter but it was weird cuz he hugged me before he left (BUT HE HAS A GF!). and it caught me off guard because as I was saying bye he hugged me and he's taller than to me too so my head went straight into his chest.

"&gt;I think he said it was most likely the 3rd, but he couldn't remember the actual call.

I have just read it again, and you're right, in that he doesn't definitively say it was on the 3rd.

&gt;Here's my basic point: the only apparent purpose of the call was or could be to verify information about Teresa's car. But there is no plausible reason for why he would be doing so if he was looking at the car. In that event, he would be lying for some nefarious reason, but there is no reason that makes any sense. Leaving the conclusion there is no reason to think he was looking at the car or doing anything other than what he said.

The problem is, the vehicle details would have been on his in car system at some early point.  If he was arguing, as he was, that he would have been given the details by Wiegert, then the only reason to check them, would be if they hadn't yet appeared on the system, so therefore, the call must have been shortly after he spoke with Wiegert, as the details were added to the system not long after Weigert had called Manitowoc.  After the details of Halback were put on the system, which he could access without needing to call dispatch, then there would be no reason whatsoever to check them with anyone.  Therefore, he would have no reason to check them when he was off duty, or even on duty for that matter after the details had been entered on the system.  

Say he wasn't working Friday, which I'm happy to accept.  What reason would he have to call in the plates.  He knew he could check the details when back at work, so why would he need to know them on his day off.  Unless of course, someone contacted him, saying they have, or think they have, found Teresa's vehicle, and gives Andy the plate details, which would of course be completely unique to that vehicle.  It wouldn't be unreasonable to assume, that while Colborn may have remembered Teresa's name, her vehicle make and year, he couldn't remember the plate.  So, he phones dispatch on his mobile, remembering they weren't normally recorded, just to find out if it really was the missing person's vehicle.  

I know you think he was joking around with dispatch, but he sounded pretty deadpan to me!  And lastly, as you can tell, I don't believe he was looking at the vehicle.  I also don't think he was expecting the plates to come back to Teresa!"

"I haven’t visited this sub in forever and I was very glad to see this as my first post when I dropped by a few minutes ago. First of all, I just want to say I empathize with you so hard. Earlier this year I had a psychotic break from health anxiety relating to my eyes. I had sudden eye disturbances too and the doctor also did a thorough exam and nothing was found. I legitimately went crazy thinking something was wrong, to the point that it affected my every day life and relationships. I completely broke after spending WEEKS fixating on the light sensitivity and related things. 

It turns out I have a dry eye disorder that was exacerbated by allergies and lots of crying. Once I started using artificial tears and getting some help for my anxiety, a lot of the symptoms and light sensitivity diminished. I still have disturbances but through positive reaffirmation (and proper eye care with sunglasses and lowering my computer lights) I’ve learned to control my anxiety around my eyes. I know how awful it is to fixate on it at the beginning though and I’m sorry it’s making you feel this bad. 

There are vitamins you can take to help strengthen your eyes, if it helps you feel better. I looked into this before and heard a lot about vitamin A, lutein and riboflavin.

I can’t tell you what you saw or what will happen, but I can say that after months of experiencing this exact same feeling that it’s finally calmed down and allowed me to live my life a little more normally, so there is some hope in setting back down again. I hope you find your peace, OP. This anxiety can go damn itself to hell. 

Sorry for the long post but if this intense feeling continues, you’re welcome to PM me. I spent literally months feeling this same way. It sounds dramatic but I was beginning to think I wouldn’t make it out alive because the anxiety was so intense and fueling my constant delusions around my eyes, but I did! I’m here and so are my little sensitive eyeballs hehe. "

"Thanks to some bludger interference from Mark, Trip is unsuccessful in his attempt to score. Which is lucky for the Slytherin Keeper, who was fooled by the Ravenclaw split-up strategy. Izzy swoops down and grabs at the quaffle, quick tossing it to Chaser 3, who then quick passes it to Henry, and the three Slytherins make their way down the field. 

They fly with big swooping dives followed by fast upwards accelerations all the way down the field. Izzy and Chaser3 doing their best to guard Henry from any pushes from the opposing chasers. The goals come into range and Henry flings the quaffle for the center hoop, the ball just barely making it past the keeper. 

Frankie is having the same luck as Soren, still unable to locate the snitch again after that near catch just a few minutes ago.

Yeah, but I'm not Disney; just because they legally own the franchise doesn't mean you have to listen to everything they say. There's no harm to fill in the blanks in Canon with Legends material, at least until they release something that directly contradicts is.

2003 Clone Wars is kinda over-the-top sometimes. Grievous in the recent Clone Wars series isn't *weak*, either; in terms of lightsaber dueling, he's at least on-par with, if not slightly above, a Jedi Council Member.

"Anyone have success increasing their running cadence?

For a long time I was running with about a 170 spm cadence. It's not particularly low, but I've had my fair share of injuries in the past 2 years and I believe it's from over striding.

So, I've made an effort to increase my cadence/shorten my stride while running. I've been able to pretty consistently run at just about 180/181 cadence, but it takes a lot focus throughout my runs to maintain that cadence and not revert back to my old ways.

For people that have successful increased their cadence - how long until it felt ""normal"" to run at a higher cadence?"

&gt;Why treat tobacco and vaping the same as cannabis?
&gt;Recognizing by-law amendments would be needed to address the introduction of legalizing recreational cannabis, we saw this as an opportunity to address complaints we’ve heard over the years about tobacco smoke on public property as a health concern through second-hand smoke.
&gt;Additionally, when it comes to enforcement, we recognized it would be very challenging to enforce a ban on just cannabis, as it would be difficult to prove exactly what substance the person was smoking/vaping. Potentially, we would have needed to gather samples of the product and get them tested in a lab to prove the substance type. This process would be problematic which is why we adopted a blanket ban approach."

"Also, we are SO free. Free to have money stolen from us by police under the policy of ""asset forfeiture"". To get back the money taken under asset forfeiture, you must prove your own innocence.

So much for freedom of speech and freedom to peaceably assemble to protest. Our televisions are strictly rated and controlled by the FCC. SO FREE!! In some states you can't collect rain water, that's some good freedom right thurr! We are so free that you can be fired from your job for being an atheist. Freedom of religion right?

Right now, the two rows matter a lot more than the three rows ever did, even in CB when huge weather swings were still a thing."

Some products will always be easy to review, such as cleansers. But then there are products like vitamin C serums that would take forever to try out. It's also 'easy' to see what product is dealing with one problem, like if you're trying out a very simple toner with no special ingredients and a vitamin C serum, it's easy to discern what's doing what.

"Owen fucked me up man.  Three roughest scenes in the show were

-Owen's brother going on some nihilistic bullshit about it not mattering what's real or not, Owen insisting that's the most important thing in the world, and his brother just laughing him off.  Saying it's ""ironic"" for Owen to have that belief, as if maintaining a perception of reality wasn't the biggest struggle of his life.

-Owen's mom trying to trigger his paranoia by suggesting that anyone outside of the family was some kind of agent in on a conspiracy to make him testify against his brother.  Just disgusting

-after the drug trial, when he's saying goodbye to Annie and immediately retreats into avoidance mode and insists he won't see their connection as anything meaningful, because to him the very prospect of a deeper connection with another person is so totally alien he's sure it must be a delusion.

The dude is so broken down, both by the stress of living with his condition and the way the outside world treats him for it, he actively avoids making any meaningful connections with others because he's been taught that any such connection is just a delusion on his part.  Then his family, the people who are supposed to care for him, actively play up that self-defeating mentality and take advantage of his paranoia, basically showing they're willing to destroy him completely and leave him a shell of a human being just to bail out his scumbag brother."

Nope, Trudeau said prosecuting ISIS members was divisive in Parliament, stated they'd be a boon to Canada in his CTV interview, then argued that they're just oppressed refugees in his Edmonton Townhall. The recent acceptance of the conservative position has been an about face. 

&gt;Not based in any reality.

Apparently the Prime Ministers statements, the Hansard record, the recordings of the PM at the Edmonton Town Hall and his CTV interview are all from an alternate reality with Bizzarro Trudeau. 

&gt;It would be if they weren't prosecuting people, but once again, it's the Conservatives that are all talk, no plan, no achievements.

Other than them actually starting investigations that Trudeau considers too divisive. "

People should have the freedom to have friendships and activities, even an occasional night off, from being a couple. His best friend wanted to treat him, which is rad. His friend shouldn’t be required to open his wallet and pay for his best friend’s girlfriend. Did the girlfriend even offer to pay her own way if he scored a third ticket?

As a result Trudeau loses the election and Conservatives take power again, the party who negotiated...wait for it... the Saudi arms deal! Wanna bet the Conservatives won't do it again? I wouldn't.

Levels have now been implemented. Levels will allow for tons of exciting new features such as weapons, armor, and more to come in the future.In order to level up, you will need to gain XP through any of the main combat game modes. Currently, XP will only be available by playing 'Waves', however, it will be implemented to more game modes as they are added.By attacking an enemy, you will gain XP. The amount of XP you will need to level up will depend on your current level.Higher levels will grant you access to better weapons and armor which will aid you in fighting the enemies.There will be loads more weapon options available as we come closer to the release date on November, 2nd!

"Look up your local law regarding the matter. You wouldn't want to get arrested and labeled a sex offender/predator for surprising the girl scout troop by accident.

"That's such a hard feeling, waiting for something to make me feel better, knowing that only the impossible would. It's dis-empowering. Coming here can be helpful, talking to friends, watching TV, etc. But it just as often leaves me feeling very empty and oh so lonely. Days are much easier, for me--dealing with errands and work and the kids needs. But nights hit so damn hard; I only want what feel like simple things, and yet they're so completely out of reach as to be non-existent."

"Wisdom tooth removal and fillings are the only procedures that are/may be medically necessary; everything else you've listed is optional/aesthetic.

You should definitely get the fillings as soon as possible. Small cavities are easier (and cheaper!) to fill.

Sealants aren't usually given to adults because it's assumed you brush your back teeth thoroughly enough. I don't believe there is any research recommending them for adults.

Wisdom teeth aren't going to cause you problems in the next few years; they usually get problematic in middle age and later, so you can afford to wait on those extractions for a few years. To minimize risk of side effects, it is recommended to get wisdom teeth removed before you turn 25, so you can wait until you graduate and have a job with dental insurance.

All told, it comes down to an immediate bill of $1350 for the fillings."

"Getting a transfer fee didn't feel like much of a consolation those days because we'd generally fail to spend it in the transfer market. (I suppose it might have gone to paying off the stadium debt, though, so that's something.) 

Remember that when he left, it was a ridiculous idea that Arsenal would sign a player for £20 million, let alone £30 million like some clubs were paying for players at the time. When we bought Podolski, Giroud, and Cazorla, each for over £10 million, we were blown away at finally seeing the club invest that sort of money. 

In that context, getting £20 million for a player didn't really give us the impression that we were going to improve our squad with that money."

The fact is mate, that the industry *does* work that way in the rest of the developed world.

"1. If RBC has not already started the process of canceling the card and mailing you a replacement card with a new number on it, call the number on the back of your card to report it as stolen.  Doesn't really matter that the physical card wasn't actually stolen; what matters is that the card information to make charges was stolen.
2. Contact your local police non-emergency number and ask to file a police report regarding fraudulent credit card charges.  They may direct you to do this online, or they may send an officer to take down your information -- they may even just do it all over the phone.  If they try to brush you off, go to the closest police station and make a report there.  
3. Log into your credit card account online and locate your cardmember agreement.  Read through the section about disputing charges, and follow those steps to formally dispute the charge.  Include in your dispute the police report number (usually issued a couple of days after the officer takes your info).
4. Assuming you're in Canada, file a complaint with the [Consumer Finance Agency of Canada](https://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/Forms-Formulaires/InqComp-PlaDemRes-eng.aspx) stating that the bank refused to consider or investigate a fraudulent charge.
5. Apply for a credit card elsewhere, and once you are approved for another card (and probably once you actually receive and activate it), cancel your RBC card. "

"That honestly depends on a lot of different circumstances. They could be copyrighted and Bungie does not own the Halo IP and by extension it is possible that they don't own the code used to implement its features. Even if they did own the code, they may not have it anymore to pour through or worse yet, was so poorly programmed and documented that finding the code for such things is not worth it. Even if they had and owned the code and it's well documented doesnt mean it's easy to understand. It is very taxing reading code that you've never seen before to understand how or why it works and how to replicate it and integrate it into new systems. Unless documentation includes line by line comments you're going to spend quite a bit of time understanding code you haven't written."

Nylon doesn't rot or mold like leather can (if neglected). You can also use nylon in wet conditions where leather cannot. Nylon is very similar to leather in most ways but just lower maintenance and often lower cost. If properly cared for a quality leather whip should last decades. I'm not sure a nylon whip would survive quite as long.

"Which is false, each have their risk, but our bodies are very good at matabolizing alcohol. Its everywhere, in sweeteners and  fruit. Light alcohol use (a glass of wine or a bottle of beer) has no negative effect and is not mind altering and in many cases there are indications that it is benificial to ones health. 

Studies often compare the abuse or heavy use between drugs, which is the problem with your statement. Its not ok to abuse drugs and alcohol (regulalry getting high or drunk), and long term effects of heavy use have correlated that many drugs are ""safer"" for your health than alcohol. For other factors like social and economic status, heavy alcohol use is considered ""safer"".  Clearly one cannot just say marijuana is safer than alcohol, and acdamia has yet to scrutinise marijuana to the degree that alcohol has been."

"Someone said this in another thread but Gunni is actually way more hittable than Cowboy is. According to [Foxsports](https://www.foxsports.com/ufc/gunnar-nelson-fighter-stats), Gunni's taken literally two times as many significant strikes as he's landed, though to be fair, most of those were in his Maia and Story fights. However, he's been outlanded in 7 of his 10 UFC fights so it's still a recurring trend. [Cowboy](https://www.foxsports.com/ufc/alex-oliveira-fighter-stats) on the other hand lands far more than he gets hit with. 

On a strikes absorbed per minute metric, Gunni gets hit by 3.7 strikes a minute compared to Cowboy's 2.1, so that just goes to show that Gunni is far more hittable than Cowboy is. 

I think that in the striking department, Cowboy's got this in the bag though it's MMA and anything can happen. The main avenue of victory for Gunni would be getting it to the ground and submitting or smeshing Cowboy but Cowboy's no slouch in grappling. Thus, if Cowboy doesn't win on the feet, this fought should be really exciting to watch in terms of grappling."

"Can I state my thoughts? because I would be interested in where people might disagree.

1. In general, most people desire intimate connections with other people. Most people then experience psychological pain at the prospect at being alone. This desire for intimacy can't be fulfilled by a large number of superficial relationships (nor can an intimate relationship fulfill our desire for superficial relationships). This effect is biological, and cannot be treated by therapeutic intervention or a change of lifestyle.
2. Feeling the above is not a sign of mental illness or a psychological disorder. It is a perfectly normal response.
3. Feeling the above can lead someone to depressive thoughts and may lead to clinical depression; but does not itself constitute depression.
4. Some people never find long term romantic partners. Many of these people feel the above pain.
5. Whether or not someone finds a long term romantic partner seems to be *mostly* independent of their political/ethical beliefs. However some beliefs will stop people from forming romantic relationships.
6. Whether or not someone finds a long term romantic partner seems to be at best weakly correlated with how well respected/ well liked they are. Many hated people easily find romantic relationships, many well-liked people do not.
7. Whether or not someone finds a long term romantic partner seems to be at best weakly correlated with their mental health. Although extreme anxiety or depression can be large barriers depending on what symptoms present themselves.
8. There seems to be some correlation between Traditional masculinity and the ability for men to find romantic partners.
9. There seems to be some correlation between physical attractiveness (Including both changeable and unchangeable factors) and the ability to form romantic relationships.
10. Based on the above there is not much justification for assuming that people who cannot find relationships are particularly stupid/evil/ugly/lazy/unwell, likewise there is not much reason to assume that people who can find relationships are particularity smart/good/attractive/motivated/healthy. While there is some correlation, it's not difficult to find a large number of counterexamples.
11. Therefore, many of the people mentioned in (4) are likely to have some other problem not addressed above. 

And more personal beliefs

1. I am probably among the group mentioned in (11)
2. I am unable to pin down what my additional problems may be, and it is unreasonable to expect that I will find them given more time.
3. After receiving professional help, it is unreasonable to expect that others will  be able to help me.
4. Therefore it is unlikely that I will ever find a romantic partner.
5. I am among the group of people for whom this is a serious problem.
6. I'm well fucked

I feel like the only way I save myself is to find a flaw in the above.

"Just looking at who has gotten a shoe is not a great way to compare this, especially if you're talking about previous generations (when that wasn't a marker of anything). The simple fact is the NBA used to be dominated by big men, and it hasn't been for a long, long time. The last real big man to win an MVP was Shaq in 2000 (Duncan won two in 02 &amp; 03, KG won one in 2004 and Dirk won one in 2007, but none were really true big men). So throw out who's had a signature shoe as some measure of the popularity of big men. Big men are less popular simply because the best players in the game haven't been big men for a long, long time. AD isn't more popular because he plays in New Orleans (and the Pels haven't gotten deep into the playoffs), not because he's tall."

Just as fighting ISIS doesn't make someone 'just like ISIS', fighting religion doesn't make someone 'just like religion'.  Until someone can successfully defend a religion against an assertion that it's making false claims about objective reality, it's not deserving of any more protection than any other lie.

It's frankly galling that people who create a problem like religion would also play the victim when it's time to fix the problem."

"If you are planning on voting in this election in Tennessee here are some things you should know. 
 
 This is a close race to turn a red seat blue, your vote will make a difference. 
 
 **Uber** and **Lyft** are both offering free rides to the polls. 
 
## ID Requirements 
 
 You DO need an ID, but the ID CAN be expired. If you are denied voting for any reason, including an expired ID request a provisional ballot. [More on Tennesse ID requirements](https://sos.tn.gov/products/elections/what-id-required-when-voting) 
 
## Early Voting 
 
 Early voting has started 
 
 Now until to November 1, 2018. In Tennessee you are allow to vote at ANY early voting location, it does not have to be in your county or precinct. To find your early voting locations view this link, https://tnsos.org/elections/election_commissions.php 
 
## Absentee Voting 
 
 For your early vote to count it must be **RECEIVED BEFORE THE POLLS CLOSE ON ELECTION DAY** This means it needs to get there the day before or earlier. Don't cut it too close and cheat yourself out of the chance to vote. More information, https://sos.tn.gov/products/elections/absentee-voting 
 
## Voting Leave 
 
 Tennessee law requires employers to provide employees with a reasonable amount of paid time off to vote up to three (3) hours. To be eligible, an employee: 
 
 must not have three (3) or more hours before their shift begins or after their shift ends in which to vote while polls are open, and request the paid voting leave by twelve o'clock (12:00) noon on the day prior to the vote or election. This means if you work an 9am t0 5 pm job, you are entitled to one paid hour off work since the pols in Tennessee are typically open from 7am til 7pm.

"&gt;This particular thing related to isomorphisms of games and fairness/symmetry/permutations/right actions is not part of the economics/CS game theory literature.

Both equivalence of games and symmetric games certainly are part of the economics/CS game theory literature. See for example Sections 3.3 and 3.4 from 'A General Theory of Equilibrium Selection in Games' by John C. Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten (who have both unfortunately passed), there's also mention of ordinal/cardinal equivalence on page 9 of 'Microeconomic Theory' by Andreu Mas-Colell, Michael Whinston and Jerry Green (which is a very popular graduate level micro text these days). A lot of books have sections on symmetric games, though many of them are not very good. And quite a few also have sections on equivalence.

It is possible to prove that ordinal/cardinal isomorphisms (which by definition preserve players' preferences over pure/mixed strategy profiles) also preserve the Nash equilibria of a game. I have never tried to prove preservation of other types of equilibria, but I'd be quite surprised if they are not also preserved.

&gt;It may show up in combinatorial games, but in that domain, 'winning plays' rather than equilibria are the solution concepts

I don't really know much combinatorial game theory, however I'd be surprised if no combinatorial game theorists are also interested in equivalence of games and symmetry/fairness in the context of combinatorial games."

That page is pretty empty because we just had rotation, so the old decks were retired. 

You have the right idea of buying the deck card by card, by the way. What I do personally is a combination of playing my decks at tournaments for packs and store credit (to then buy cards) and drafting to pull cards which I then trade for cards that might fit better into my deck.

Check out FNM (Friday Night Magic) and see if there's a store that does drafts, or once you have your deck of choice, a standard FNM.

Much like humans that suffer from congenital defects or debilitating disease we don't say ""just euthanize them"" or ""prohibit them from breeding"". That's honestly a sad way of looking at the world. Stop shaming people that love pugs because they truly love them for who they are. People will continue to breed them regardless. They will always exist no matter how much people whine and at the end of the day they still need loving owners that don't deserve to feel a sense of shame because of butthurt wannabe philosophy majors that think it's ""unethical"" to own them.

"Hi guys, i recently started getting into gunpla, i have not made anything yet i just saw it and want to get started. I plan to start with a real grade unicorn as my first gundam. And it may be hard but i have lego experience lol(even though its still alot harder).

Anyways i was planning to panel line it aswell as add a matte topcoat(mr.topcoat). To remove the cheap shiny plastic vibe. My question is how do i actually build a gundam. As in not assemble it. But like do i panel line everysingle piece that is in that plastic panel or do i build segments and then panel line it. And lets say i am supposed to panel line EVERY SINGLE SMALL PIECE in that plastic panel, do i then topcoat everysingle piece. Or do i build i certain area, eg arm or foot, then panel line and then topcoat the whole foot.

Pretty much i will make a summary(write a combo of how it is done)

Panel lining: 1)after you cut each piece out of tray panel line it 2)after you cut out and assemble, lets say a hand and then panel line the whole hand( so segment by segment)

Topcoat: 1) top coat everysingle piece once removed from plastic panel/tray thingy 2) topcoat a certain section eg foot/arm

Basically so write an order like 1,2 meaning i do the 1 for panel lining and the 2 for topcoating. Meaning i would panel line EVERYSINGLE TINY PIECE and then make segments eg arm and then topcoat the arm(this is just example i dont know what way is right)

So please tell me the combo i am supposed to do. thankssss

[To stretch and work your jaw](http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ncr3025/roussel/codi531/oralmotor.htm):

   Open your jaw as wide as you can until you feel a stretching, but no pain.  Hold this furthest open position for 5 seconds then relax and close your mouth. 
   Repeat this open posture 5 times.

 2. **Side-to-Side Movement:** 
   Move your jaw to the right side as far as you can until it pulls but does not hurt.  Hold it there for 5 seconds then relax.  Move your jaw to the left side as far as you can until you feel a stretch but it does not hurt.  Hold it there for 5 seconds then relax. 
   Alternate this right to left movement 5 times.

 3. **Increasing Circular Jaw Movement:** 
   Move your jaw around in a circle making it move as far in each direction as you can until you feel a stretch but no pain.  In this circular movement you will be increasing range of motion in all directions. When you have completed a full circle relax. 
   Repeat the circular movement 5 times. "

"I don't live in NA/EU so a different perspective. No widespread computer use, let alone the internet, until the late 90s - and even then it was dialup - my dad still has his original username today and it's got a year suffix, ""97"", and we were relatively early adopters.

Everything was decidedly more ""local""; especially in the context of memes. I mean, nowadays even people here have heard of dabbing. Back in the 1990s maybe a few of us would've stumbled on random pictures of people dabbing posted on their Yahoo homepage or something, and we would likely have simply dismissed it as more foreign craziness (whereas nowadays it's just plain old craziness).

Speaking about music, no Youtube, and before filesharing took off you were pretty much limited by what bones the mainstream deigned to throw your country's way, and the alternatives were most likely local bands. Stereotypes exist for a reason (""if that kid's a metalhead chances are he's heard of Metallica""), there was simply no practical way to get hold of anything else. Also wasn't uncommon to own a cassette tape which was a copy of a copy of a copy from someone who's friend's brother's cousin was in a band you'd never heard of, and it'd sit in your collection filed under ""other bands"".

Not gonna nostalgia glasses it, most everything else wasn't really that different. If I were working back then though, since the internet didn't exist (let alone Reddit), I'd probably be wasting my time reading during my free time at work (even nowadays I almost always have something from FFN or AO3 on my phone to read). Computers back then were mostly standalone beasts, networks were usually some unholy abomination of several device drivers that required things like blood sacrifice to work. Games did exist (GoG has a nice selection of oldies), but it's not like you could alt-tab them like nowadays. At most you'd probably be able to run solitaire or freecell or minesweeper."

Some people regret it because they didn't use it. (Because they 1/ decided they didn't want to buy home 2/ couldn't afford to buy home 3/ met soul mate who already owned the perfect home or 4/ they used a gift, inheritance or other savings for their down payment.)

Others regret using it because they 1/ couldn't repay it (because of unanticipated child care  costs) and ended up paying more tax than the refund generated by the original contribution or 2/ did repay it but wished that those RRSP deposits were either generating a higher tax refund and/ or higher Child Benefit payments."

It's stupid because sometimes they would block it then unblock it a minute later then block it again. I ended up having to call them twice.

When I moved to Japan I had to call them several times. Usually at least once a year. I kept telling them where I was and they kept saying they would make a note only for it to happen again.

"&gt; What does ""verifiable science"" mean?
&gt; What does ""observable science"" mean?

Here, ""verifiable"" and ""observable"" are pretty much synonyms. If it's being verified, it's being observed, and if it was observed, it's been verified, so I'm going to give only a single definition that includes both of these, from dictionary.com:

&gt; observable in Science: A measurable property of a physical system, such as mass or momentum. In quantum mechanics, observables correspond to mathematical operators used in the calculation of measurable quantities.

But I feel like this is not enough for you, so here is one more from allaboutscience.org that explains the Scientific Method:

&gt; The scientific method can be divided into two primary categories: (1) empirical science and (2) historical science. Empirical science entails a systematic approach to epistemology that uses observable, testable, repeatable, and falsifiable experimentation to understand how nature commonly behaves. It finds its implementation in such disciplines as immunology, rocket science, molecular biology, etc.

When I say ""verifiable and observable science"" I don't literally mean only verification and observation, but everything else that comes with the scientific method, which also includes testing and finding repeatable results. If this doesn't answer your first two questions, I don't know what will. I'm basing my reasoning on the scientific method.

&gt; Black holes cannot be directly observed, because they swallow light.
&gt; This wikipedia page explains how astronomers infer the existence of a black hole

I think I understand the confusion that's going on here because of my choice of word ""observable"". Yes, we can infer the existence of a black hole, and that's the thing. We can infer *something*. There's a direction ahead that we can investigate based on previous collected information, which were collected through scientific means. I actually don't mind if what is inferred turns out to be true or false in the end. The point is that we can actually do something with what's at hand. The ""god did it"" leaves us completely empty handed. Nothing to investigate, nothing to infer. Am I being vague here? Because I really don't know how can I explain this any better. I don't care if model M is an accurate model or not, the fact that we have a model in the first place is what's important here.

&gt; Let me make it more concrete. Goldbach's conjecture

Oh, now that's an interesting one. It reminds me of the The Four Color Map Theorem. I can acknowledge you bringing this up, but I feel like it's a bit out of scope here. The objectivity of numbers, such as the value of pi, exists with our without science or any intelligence around to study it. You said:

&gt; But all of these verifiable and observable experiments are not enough that we can claim that the conjecture is true

Yes, you're right there. The important part here is that *you can do* verifiable and observable experiments. If a mathematician will not accept them, that's understandable, but at least there were steps taken for that conclusion. As much as I'm curious to know what's the actual truth/proof, is not really what I'm focusing here. People can agree or disagree with what they want, but what I'm saying is that an answer based on verifiable and observable science (scientific method) is an appropriate one, and ""god did it"" is not an appropriate one since it doesn't explain anything. If the current explanation (not an answer) to the Goldbach's conjecture is that it should remain unproven despite considerable verifiable and observable experiments, that's perfectly fine with what I'm saying. If we don't have an answer to the Goldbach's conjecture, that's fine with me too.

&gt; now we're back to the problem of determining what ""necessary standards"" means

Scientific method. If this is not enough to answer you, I don't know what is.

&gt; Maybe the real problem with ""God did it"" as an explanation is not that it doesn't explain anything, but that we have no way of distinguishing between the possibilities (God did it) and (God didn't do it)?

Can you elaborate?"

"What does the future hold for trans healthcare in the light of potential therapies like CRISPR gene-knock outs for DMRT1, 3d-printable sex organs, and using stem cells to grow a neovagina or penis on a scaffold?

"the cheat code to all of this is to sound select by frequency range -- literally just look at where that sounds fit in on your master EQ and fill the blank spaces as best you can. 

you might find a snare that sounds like the coolest fucking snare or a synth patch like that or whatever and then wonder why it doesn't work or sound all cool when the rest off your track is playing -- its probably because its clashing with something else in its natural frequency range

if u really wanna be a badass (and honestly I think I hit another level in my production when I started doing this) start synthesizing your own sounds with all this in consideration -- can't find a good patch to fit your songs current frequency makeup? make one. you have total control over where every piece of your song fits in the spectrum, create accordingly. same for kicks, snares, bass, etc -- the only constant really is your vocals if you're recording them, which you should generally be leaving space in the same freq range for on a song by song basis

a lot of what makes the hottest producers the hottest producers is their ability to fill the frequency range up efficiently and effectively (that is as few sounds as possible filling up the most space) -- thats true of everyone from Dilla to Pierre Bourne.

Cool story. 
"Voting is done at the state level which is why it can be very confusing in the US. In some states you can be a citizen but denied the right to vote because you are a convicted felon. Some states automatically enroll or register all residents of their state and only issue mail in ballots. Some states require you to have valid state issued Identification card and that requires a fee to be issued which is a barrier to those in poverty. So you can be registered to vote and be denied because you don't have a state ID. Recently a state has denied those with IDs issued from Native American Reservations because they are not considering them legal state IDs which greatly impacts large portions of indigenous people who may not have the ability to get to an office that issues state IDs (in previous years this was not an issue) I've personally voted for years without having to prove my identity until we went to mail in only ballots and they go by the address given for State IDs. Our whole voting process is archaic and problematic.

To answer your second question, no. There is zero uniform language about where voting has to take place. You can have voting places that open and close at ridiculous times or there may be no local voting place available and you have to travel miles in order to get to one. I think this is part of the voting suppression issue that is apparent and frustrating but cannot be solved without people voting. Kind of circular, Right?

The apa's official stance on this: https://www.apa.org/about/policy/corporal-punishment.aspx

Here is a direct quote from Peterson out of 12 rules for life, chapter 5:

&gt; If that fails, being turned over a parent’s knee might be required. For the child who is pushing the limits in a spectacularly inspired way, a swat across the backside can indicate requisite seriousness on the part of a responsible adult.

__________

Honestly though, I don't think that will do much.  
Peterson is a charlatan. He will try to weasel his way out of anything.   
He will either deny having said it, or having meant it that way. Or he will try to paint it off as him being a lone genius in a world that is out to get him, and the fans will cheer him on. Or just attack you for asking the question, like ""well, you're not an expert. I'm a clinical psychologist. You just don't understand this. bla bla bla bla""

The most fun thing is to push him into a corner and ask him to answer something that would upset his patreon supporters.

"This is a difficult question to answer, because on one hand weed is a drug and it does have addictive properties. On the other hand whether that means you will develop a problem with it is a different story.

Weed stimulates the pleasure centers in your brain and this can be habit forming, and long term use could lead to you feeling a bit sadder when you come off of it. These effects are temporary, and you won't have more aggressive withdrawal symptoms like you might for nicotine or harder substances. If you're worried that you'll be addicted in the sense of jonesing for a fix, relax that won't happen. You'll just be a little sadder/emotionally neutral for a few days while your brain recalibrates.

Weed can only be a problem if you abuse it, and use it to escape responsibilities and problems you face in the real world. As long as you are fulfilling your responsibilities to yourself and your loved ones, weed will not pose any problems for you."

"Before the Carterfone decision by the FCC in 1968, AT&amp;T prohibited the attachment of non-AT&amp;T owned phones to their network. So they required that everyone rent a phone, and people didn't have the ability to buy one.

The power to attach third party devices became a really powerful tool, laying the groundwork for the invention of the answering machine, phone-monitored security systems, and the dial up modem."

"I'm going to be real with you for a second: Wiring DE is really, really boring. You figure out how to route wires depending on how many first class, business class, economy plus class, and economy class seats each plane has. There are some other customer options that also determine the length and location of wires. 

If there's a question of where to hang a wire, you go down to the shop floor to point out where to put the wire. 

You make PowerPoints showing prospective wire locations. 

Sometimes if someone messes up a wire, you have to agree with the manufacturing engineer on how to replace it. 

You will probably be in Everett or Renton rather than Seattle. "

I last adopted my male GS when he was 7-9 months old. His former owner didn’t have previous experience with the breed, only smaller lapdogs. At first, my boy was restless and destructive when he wasn’t trying to fit himself in my lap. Great temperament and sweet though. He was learning quickly but still needed other outlets. I then fostered some orphaned puppies and three stray cats. My boy learned his favorite job was keeping a constant eye/snoot on the other animals. This became how he spent his time during the day when no people were home and his destruction stopped. The first two years are the most challenging in my opinion because it takes constant reinforcement to direct their energies into something other than losing your rental deposit lol"

"I hate to say it, but there were times - incredibly, incredibly rare times, but existent nevertheless - where I did think he showed some level of human decency. When he asked Tywin about Daenerys, and insisted that Tywin shouldn't underestimate dragons as much as he did, that was actually a decent point. And the fact that he actually put on armor and went out to the battlements when Stannis attacked - even if he pussied out not too long afterwards - at least showed some incredibly minimal level of potential leadership skill.

At the end of the day, while he absolutely wasn't a good person by any means whatsoever, he was also still a kid, for all intents and purposes, and a lot of the fault lies with his shitty ""You can have anything you want and the truth will be what you say it is once you're King"" upbringing by Cersei. The incest probably didn't help in any way, either.

"I agree with your contention about intergenerational wealth and housing; most of the racial wealth gap (really the wealth gap period) can be explained by differences in housing. 

I would argue the way to fix this is to jettison the whole complex of policies that consecrate homeownership, especially large single-family detached suburban homeownership, as the favored mode of investment and living: the mortgage interest deduction, property tax deductions at the state and federal level, SALT, restrictionist zoning (this item of course could be its own list), certain environmental regulations, and down payment assistance.

Then, separate from the above, we should (smartly) expand social insurance. A well-designed localized minimum wage increase, an expanded EITC, and a universal basic income would be my top asks."

Contact with course mentors (teachers) was as needed.

"CoG's a fair bit too close to the hilt for-handling similarly to the original ones - in use that sort of CoG will make it nice and easy to use, very little effort needed to move it round, but also, rather vague in the cut, and lacking authority.   
Originals tend to be between 3-4 inches from the cross, generally speaking.   


All in all, its a pretty reasonable first effort. for future ones, I'd suggest your first step is to look at wider stock, 50mm x 5-8mm thick (I'm going to assume you're non-US or an engineer, given you used metric throughout. is a pretty good ballpark figure for most, although you do get some down to only about 36mm wide.   
Doing that will move mass up the blade, especially if you're putting in a lot of distal taper for a wider-bladed cutter. that in turn will allow you to use a smaller pommel, which results in a more agile, mobile blade even with the CoG further out from the cross. Your second step for one should be to look at a non-tubular cross - that's the main shape that leaps out at my eye as being pretty wonky. you can easily use a 10x20mm barstock for that, with a wee bit of grinding down to about 9mm  x 18mm thick right at the centre of the cross.  Piercing that is pretty easy to do - just drill a line of holes and then broach through with a needle file or a die grinder with carbide burr, and you'll have a good base to even up into a rectangular slot, and then profile for the shoulders and the blade.   


the main point from there, really is to look at originals, and get a feeling for the three-dimensional thicknesses, how crosses and pommels taper and swell through their length, and the likes. Swords are always changing thier cross-sections, in subtle detailed ways which really define how they look visually.    


On that regard, you said about the cross being too wide, as a really simple rule of thumb for a sword like this, look at geometric proportion. if its 120cm overall, split it into 4 sections - blade 90cm, hilt 30cm. you can then have the cross 30cm wide, and you'll have the very basics of a nice geometric proportion which is comfortable on the eyes.   


(Or, if you want to get more detailed. make the diameter of the pommel, and the width of the blade a ratio of the lenght - for instance, split the overall length into 5 sections, blade  86cm, the hilt 24cm long, then take that 24cm, and split it again as a module, lets say 1/5th again, that would give you a pommel diameter and blade width of 4.8cm. Then take that module, and lets take the third interval, 4/5ths as the cross, and that would make it 19.2cm wide. In that way, you can construct the design by use of a compass and a straight line, and design the sword in really simple, elegant ways. There's a lot of subtle, hidden geometry like that which can be used in the design of the sword, to make the proportions pleasant to look on, and its rather fun to do such design work before ever setting hammer to steel. )

Now there are situations where I’m sure had she gone straight to the authorities and cooperated they would not have charged her. But we don’t know what happened and there’s no info of her in the news story. Makes me think she had done that and they didn’t charge her. But if she didn’t, and they later found out she knew and was present and did not report it or do anything about it, then she would be an accomplice to a crime and also be tried for attempted murder.

Edit: sorry, wrong word choice for those that get off on arguing online over semantics. Not bystander, but present with the person committing the crime, during the crime."

"I didn't find anything in Wikipedia's ERISA about disability.  I meant Short Term Disability.  

In my (exclusively call center) experience, STD and Long Term Disability were benefits offered and paid for by the company (like paid vacation/sick days/holidays and Life Insurance) but one or both could be upgraded during benefits enrollment.  

All I would ask HR for is stuff you can't get from another department or on your own.  HR is barely involved in the process; the insurance company coordinates getting and verifying your claim.

Also, check into FMLA if you miss/have missed enough work to violate attendance policy due to your injury.  I think you only have 15 days either from the first adverse action or from the injury; I'm not sure which but, if your company is big enough to have to follow it, they might want to retain you and waive the timeframe.

STD:  pays a percentage of your normal pay after missing a certain number of days work due to disability/sickness.

LTD:  pays a (usually lower) percentage than STD once STD times out.  Sometimes until or even after you qualify for SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance).

FMLA:  helps avoid losing your job due to absences due to a medical condition.

Good luck and get well soon!"

"This has definitely been TP’s strongest suit and one of the major reasons, for all its flaws, it remains my favorite game. There’s so many more memorable moments compared to many of the other major entries. Colin’s Kidnapping, The Eldin Bridge Joust, The Duel With Ganondorf, Modena Shattering the Mirror, just to name a few.

It also benefits from the brilliant use of incidental music which started with WW but they nailed perfectly in TP, SS didn’t succeed as well I think mostly to the change in musical style compares to previous entries. So many of the scenes are memorable because Minegishi and the team accompanied them brilliantly."

"In general, there isn't a reason to just lay a hand on the genital area, though for specific maneuvers, sometimes it is required, or even inserting a finger or instrument into the vagina to feel the posterior wall which contacts the colon. 

That being said, it's really difficult to say if something was inappropriate without actually knowing the situation. It could have been that there were tissue folds that had to be held out of the way, or the doctor had to have his hand there in order to hold an instrument in proper position. Or it could have been something like a speculum that has a handle off at an angle that required a particular hand position to use. 

Ultimately, there could be valid reasons, or it was inappropriate, its impossible to know without knowing the full details of the situation. 

There should always be a female staff member in the room when when a male physician is performing a sensitive exam on a female patient. Was this the case? It sounds like she is uncomfortable about it, if she feels able, she should bring it up with that doctor, or with other staff at that clinic. His nurse, clinic manager, etc. Or, she could bring it up with another doctor she trusts such as her primary care doctor or oncologist to see if they might have a better understanding of what happened, and if not, to direct her to the proper people to report it. If she felt uncomfortable, she should say something to someone. If it was a legitimate part of the exam, then at the very least, the doctor needs to be informed so he can do better in the future such as explaining what he is doing so his patients understand."

"Yellow is not triggering trypophobia. You can have a problem with yellow for some other reason, but to say it's triggering your trypophobia is wrong.  

Here is an image of Drake in black face.  https://m.imgur.com/gallery/Cmtu7hY

It's possible for Drake to be in black face because it's very specific. Just like the things that trigger trypophobia are very specific. Claiming yellow triggers your trypophobia is false, and claiming all instances of someone coloring their face non white is black face is false in precisely the same manner. 

I've been personally ordered by black people to paint my face black. In basic training. By drill instructors. For camouflage instruction.

Was coloring my face black black face?  No.  Neither was Robert Downey Junior's depiction of a  (a person depicting a) black person in Tropic Thunder.  He was playing a character, and I was in training.  And black people were not offended by either of us.  Neither were people offended by Angelina Jolie's portrayal of Mariane Pearl in A Mighty Heart.

Context matters. And portraying a specific person of color is a different context than black face, which is so obvious that when Drake did it, it was clear what he was portraying."

With the recent Amex Gold card changes and having just opened an Amex Blue Business plus (2x points), I'm wondering if there is a point of getting an Amex Platinum back again and would love to just hear thoughts on whether I'm needlessly dividing my charges up too much and if I should just focus on Chase or Amex points.

"I lived in 1300 last year with a custom built PC and sometimes my Ethernet would stop working.

Something that worked for me a lot of the time (but not always) was this:

* **Step 1** -  Press Win+R to open the Run panel, then type ""services.msc"" and hit enter.

* **Step 2** - Scroll down until you see ""Wired AutoConfig""

* **Step 3** - Right click on it and hit Stop, then restart your PC and repeat steps 1 and 2.

* **Step 4** - Right click ""Wired AutoConfig"" and hit Start.

Once you do this, wait for a minute and see if a window appears asking for your logon credentials. If so, enter your AccessNet username and password and cross your fingers. If not, restart your PC and see if it comes up.

Sorry to get your hopes up if it doesn't work, but it has for me in the past."

"There’s a restaurant by me that is famous for it’s labor inducing eggplant parm. If you have your baby within 48 hours of eating it, you get a $25 gift certificate and a onesie. 

I tried it just before my due date and nothing.  But three days after my due date, I went to their sister restaurant and tried again. I also had a tablespoon of castor oil that same night and my water broke just a few hours later (no signs of labor prior).  Some say it was a coincidence, but I believe it was a combination of both the eggplant and the oil.

"I just feel like Disney parks are all about atmosphere. There are few thrill rides but that is not their selling point. When you go to a disney park, you feel like a part of a community.

In fact I feel that Marvel could probably blend in better at Universals where there are more thrill rides and doesn't exactly sell you on a manufactured atmosphere. I don't think dark rides really work for Marvel assets. BUT, of course Marvel is Disney IP now and the next best thing is a Marvel park."

"That was [addressed on page 2](https://www.ulisses-us.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=30614#p30614) -- as per the explanation provided, ""physical"" grenades are free (after purchase); you consume them before using Reloads. Meaning:

* the first grenade you acquire unlocks the ""special attack"" (similar to a loaded weapon allowing Salvo, Suppressive Fire, or Multi-attack)
* any grenade use after the first consumes a Reload (similar to having to Reload the gun if you used its ammo)
* acquiring additional grenades adds further non-Reload uses

Of note, this was flagged as ""Verification Pending"", so that may not be the final word on the matter. The poster of the FAQ was a Ulisses employee and moderator, but not a game designer, so they're probably not the final stage of authority on this.

Anyways, of this particular ruling I am personally not a fan, as it runs counter to the elegance of the Reload system. I think it would have been preferable to just retcon equipment mentions like ""3 frag grenades"" into just ""frag grenades"" and call it a day. :p"

There is nothing more hurtful of weeks or months of reluctant touching, halfhearted sex, very obvious change in mood and vibe, all leading up to a tentative offer to go to the gym together. The fact that you felt a certain way about her for so long and hid it from her is way more hurtful and pretty humiliating for when she does find out- because she will. People can sense when someone isn't attracted to them anymore, unless you're very carefully monitoring your behavior and reactions. 

She's the love of your life. She deserves the truth. And you deserve an emotionally AND physically fulfilling relationship. If you don't get your physical needs met, it might end up damaging your relationship in all kinds of ways.

It's simple, all you have to say is something like ""I love you and that will never change, but ever since you put on weight, I'm not as physically attracted to you as I used to be."" Trust me, I would much rather hear this up front than find out later. "

"You're aware that there's no development studio behind Hyper Universe anymore to make these changes, right? CWavesoft has shut down operations, the website is gone, etc. All that remains is a port team at another company which can do only simple adjustments to get the existing global PC builds to run on xbox, so baring a miracle, all you will get is exactly what PC already got, just with the content lumped together into fewer patches (PC got Schmidt and Red separately over a longer period.) As such, changing queue and game handling is almost certainly out of the question unless CWavesoft resumes operations or a new studio - not just a port team - is assigned the game.

Most likely your remaining major patches will consist of one with Lyn, Hulahula and Fortress of the Guardians, then a final patch with Maya, Kairos and House of Mysteries. There's nothing left to release after that, probably not even Psion Ignitia, so make the most of it."

Therefore: We should value the well being of all animals as we do dogs.

The big problem with OP's case IMHO, is that premise 1 (in my example) has not been justified. Is this along the lines of what you are saying?"
"&gt;The question of how the migrant caravan began has wound its way to the American midterm elections. President Trump and other Republicans have suggested that Democrats paid migrants to begin the journey. As the group continues to grow, the largest such caravan in recent years, its beginnings are being scrutinized: How did more than 5,000 migrants from across Central America find each other?

&gt;Although the caravan’s origin story remains somewhat opaque, the answer from many migrants here is that they had wanted to leave for months or years, and then — in a Facebook post, on a television program, in a WhatsApp group — they saw an image of the growing group and decided.

&gt;…Vice President Pence said in an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday that Honduras’s president told him that the caravan was financed by Venezuela’s left-wing government. There is no evidence to support that claim.


&gt;…In September, there were posts on Honduran Facebook groups about the plans for the caravan.

&gt;“These people who have normally migrated, hidden, day after day, had decided to come together and travel together to protect themselves,” Fuentes said.

&gt;He said he was in touch with four groups of would-be migrants who were talking on WhatsApp and other social networks — in Tegucigalpa, the capital, as well as La Ceiba, Colon and San Pedro Sula — about the possibility of traveling together.

&gt;“They contacted me; they said, ‘We saw what you’ve written; we want you to tell us how the caravan had gone in March,’ ” he said.

&gt;…A week before the caravan started, Fuentes posted on his Facebook page a flier about the caravan that read, “We aren’t going because we want to, violence and poverty is driving us out.” It called people to meet at 8 a.m. Oct. 12 at the San Pedro Sula bus terminal.

&gt;…“Everyone wants to know who is guilty, who is behind this,” said Irineo Mujica, director of Tijuana-based Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which has advocated for this and previous caravans, helping to arrange the routes and other logistics. “But no one has the power to organize this many people. No one can engineer an exodus.”

&gt;By mid-October, the explosion of media coverage and viral social media posts across Central America prompted an explosion in the number of migrants. Within days of the caravan’s departure from San Pedro Sula on Oct. 13, almost no one could pin down the group’s official origin story. They could cite only the Facebook post or television program that led to their own decision to migrate.

&gt;…Migrant caravans have traveled through Central America for several years, part human rights protest, part effort to guarantee safe passage for Central Americans traversing a dangerous route north. Normally, a Central American migrating to the United States must pay a series of cartel-linked smugglers to make the journey, a sum that can reach more than $10,000. The caravan offered a relatively safe way to migrate that was basically free of cost.

&gt;The last caravan, which left southern Mexico in March, received so much media attention, particularly during its final days, that it appears to have set the groundwork for the current, larger exodus, said many migrants.

&gt;…By the time Irma Rosales heard about the caravan in El Salvador, the migrants were already nearing the Guatemala border. Her husband had been murdered a year earlier, she said, and after she reported the crime to the police, the MS-13 threats began naming her.

&gt;“I didn’t have the money to pay for a coyote, so the caravan was the only way,” she said.

&gt;After she saw the images of the group on television, she typed “caravana migrante” into Google and saw that the migrants were expected to reach the Guatemala-Mexico border in two days, on Oct. 19. She paid about $10 for three separate bus tickets, traveling for 16 hours, making it to the border on time to catch the caravan.

&gt;Then she bought a Mexican phone card and texted her cousin in Chicago.

&gt;“I’m coming,” she wrote.

"Shitty basic services like internet &amp; phone bills. 


Was on my dads family plan up until a year ago and he was paying $70+ a month for 4 GB shared. I told him it was a shit deal for like a year and after a coming back from traveling and seeing how important having WiFi truly is I got on my own plan. I now pay less than what he did for an unlimited plan. Does kinda piss me off that he got the same deal I did Bc he had to be there when I got off his line. I know it’s kinda petty but not a fan of him getting a better deal Bc of me and now me having to pay extra while also saving him money. 


Similar situation happened with my mom, she was paying like $70+ a month for internet that was SUPPOSED to be 7 Mbps down but instead for the last 5+ years we were getting MAX 3 Mbps down and many many days 0.50 or less Mbps down. I told her she was being absolutely ripped off but she said “well it’s good enough for me to watch Netflix, you can always buy it” but I’d been planning to move out for awhile (took awhile to make it happen) and wasn’t going to pay an exorbitant installation fee for something I’d use for like 3-4 months max. But again, we recently moved 3 weeks before I moved out and she finally realized how she could get internet 20x better than what she had for like half the price. Kinda pissed me off that it took me leaving for her to make that change Bc she very clearly doesn’t need it and it didn’t help em at all. But now I get like 200mbps down for even less than she gets her 50 down for.

"That’s just how a lot of people in college are. Many people view college as a time to be free and live out all their desires, and look at serious relationships as a limit to their personal freedoms. If they want to travel abroad, or go out and party a bunch, or move across the country after graduation, they don’t want to deal with the “problem” of being in love with someone and having to choose between their partner and something else they really want to do. 

Sometimes it’s more simple and people think college is a good time to be as wild and promiscuous as possible before they have to enter the “adult world.”

I totally get it for the most part. I have a long term gf and I will be graduating next year, way before her. (I’m getting a masters and her a PhD.)  I’m gonna have to move away from our little college town to get the kinds of jobs I want, and I’m terrified of how that’s gonna work out for us while she has to say here for like 3 more years. 

Not everyone feels that way though. You’ll find someone. Maybe not applicable, but consider the situations  where you’re meeting girls (parties, tinder, the library). For example these girls might have some unspoken expectations of how things are gonna be with the guy they met browsing tinder on a Saturday night, and they might assume you have the same expectations.

"If you don't even know what whitespace is you won't understand how this code would work.

Whereas Ruby looks like this

    def hello()
        puts ""hi""
    end

Python does not have `end` keywords to group statements and instead relies on consistent indentation, like this:

    def hello(w):
        print(""Hello"", w)

    def main():
        word = ""world""
        hello(word)

    main()
    
When using a text editor and pressing the enter key to start a new line, you actually insert an ASCII ""newline"" symbol, which looks like `\n`; you just don't normally see it after pressing enter in a text editor.  Similarly, when you press tab you get '\t'.  

Whereas languages like Ruby, Lua, or Erlang use `end` to group statements into functions or to define the scope of loops or do other stuff, and languages like C, Java, or Go use curly braces, Python uses consistent indentation, or ""whitespace"" which can be either spaces ("" ""), tabs, or newlines.

You should start from the basics otherwise you will not understand code like this."

"I have a lot of jumbled thoughts about this. You may or may not care, but I'm going to put them out here anyway.

I think it's sad that when bombs are sent to people, rather than feeling empathy or concern, the first thought by so many people is to assume a political ploy for the sake of votes. If bombs had been sent to George Bush and Condeleeza Rice, would you have the same response? Or would you blame violent leftists?

Another thought. I heard so many conservatives a few weeks ago say ""we need to get all the facts"" and ""where is the evidence"" and ""show me the proof."" Now those same people with no proof, evidence or facts are all-in on this particular theory. These are brutally contradictory attitudes.

Finally the notion that a bomb threat would get someone to vote is crazy. I don't personally know any democrats that aren't voting in the midterms. A bomb threat isn't going to make someone who is apathetic toward politics any more likely to vote. ""Well, I wasn't sure if I was going to vote, but since Obama got a bomb from an unknown source, I'm definitely going to vote now."" That is a sentence no human will ever speak."

"It depends on how you look at it. I do not see any suffering in the crypto market what so ever. I’ve been using crypto for close to ten years now and everything is at an extremely high value compared to its value two years ago. 

Hell bitcoin is worth 12 times what it was two years ago. You can’t gage anything by those few months when the values all skyrocketed. What happened there was normal folks heard about bitcoin and it was on cnn ever day and they all thought they were going to get rich. So tons was invested and people lost their asses and sold all the coin they’d just bought and prices dropped. 

That’s not going to happen again any time soon. But like I said bitcoin is worth about 12 times what it was 2 years ago. So I can’t say it’s suffering. 

I reckon if someone thought it was a good idea to invest in a volatile new crypto currency when it was at its all time high then those folks may be suffering, LoL.

I can see reflections in my parking garage of brake lights and backup lights when I pull out of my spot. When I have the car in park but running with the headlights on, the tail lights light up.


DRL = daytime running lights? I don’t have those. I have a very basic model of my car. The headlights are manual, they don’t turn on automatically when it gets dark. I bought the car used from a dealer a little over a year ago.


I’ve noticed over the past month or so that a lot of cars were flashing their brights at me when behind me. That’s why I checked out the status of the lights while parked. I was so confused because the tail lights were fully on, and I could see my brake light activate when I pressed the brake petal. But I checked out my tail light reflection in the front bumper of the car behind me when it got dark while I was driving this evening, and I noticed that once I took my foot off the brake, there were no more red lights reflected in the bumper of the car behind me.

"&gt;Except for the no debt part of course, but I believe that doctors in the U.S. make much more money in the long run compared to doctors in Germany (on average of course)

I only know about the cliché of American doctors getting filthy rich after their residency and don't have actual numbers, but I guess there's some truth to it.

Although as far as I know a senior physician is still in the 95-99% income bracket in Germany, so they can't complain I guess.

"&gt;Hello all.

Welcome to the sub.

&gt;I am currently 4 days into my first outbreak of oral hsv2.

Okay. How do you know it's oral hsv2? That's a pretty quick turnaround time for test results. Were you swab tested?

&gt;I am on my second day of valacyclovir. I'm not having any pain so far, about when should I start expecting it?

A herpes outbreak is not necessarily painful. There is a wide range in the level of discomfort possible, ranging from very significant to virtually unnoticeable. Among other things, it can depend on where the lesion(s) occur and how extensive the outbreak is. But even apart from things like that it can be highly variable.

&gt;How do I go about making it go as smoothly as possible and let it do its thing, maybe even speed it up to get it over with?

That's precisely what the valacyclovir is for.

&gt;Am I making it worse by vaping and using chapstick?

The vaping would not be an issue. I'm not an expert on the chapstick question but I doubt it would have any significant impact either way. My personal recommendation would be to simply not apply chapstick to the cold sore directly, but you could still apply it to the rest of your lips. But again, that's more of a gut-sense recommendation rather than coming from any expert knowledge. My reasoning is that it might, in some minor way, interfere with the scabbing process. But I suspect that's unlikely."

 O candidato do **[PT](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/pt-partido-dos-trabalhadores)** à **Presidência** nas **[eleições 2018](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/elei%C3%A7%C3%B5es%202018)**, **[Fernando Haddad](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/Fernando%20Haddad)**, afirmou em entrevista exibida na noite desta quarta-feira, 24, pela *TV Aparecida* que o concorrente dele, **[Jair Bolsonaro](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/Jair%20Bolsonaro)** (**[PSL](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/psl-partido-social-liberal)**), teve ""produção zero"" durante a vida parlamentar dele.

 ""Bolsonaro é um privilegiado. Ele é deputado há 28 anos, ele tem um aparato de assessores enorme, o custo de manter um deputado é enorme. E a produção dele é zero, a não ser a discórdia, a violência e a agressão"", disse o petista.

 Durante a conversa, Haddad tentou se associar a valores cristãos e antagonizar com Bolsonaro. ""Bolsonaro não tem compromisso com democracia e apoia a tortura. Como alguém se diz comprometido com a vida e quer armar a população?"", disse.

 O petista fez ainda uma defesa do Estado laico. ""Todo mundo tem que ter vez. O Estado tem de abraçar todas as crenças. Isso tem a ver com o amor. É muito grave um candidato se associar a somente uma igreja"", afirmou.

 Ele também repetiu que vai lutar para que a Justiça ""reforme a sentença"" que condenou o ex-presidente **[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/lula-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva)**, condenado e preso pela** [Operação Lava Jato](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/Opera%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Lava%20Jato)**.

 O candidato também afirmou na entrevista que a proposta dele, em caso de ser eleito, é ""contra a venda do patrimônio nacional"". ""Nós não vamos vender a Petrobrás, o Banco do Brasil, a Caixa, os Correios. São estatais estratégicas para a nação"", afirmou. ""Mas vamos fazer parcerias para acabar o Comperj, a Refinaria Abreu e Lima, por exemplo.""

 O petista acusou ainda o concorrente Jair Bolsonaro de pregar a privatização. Haddad afirmou que o ""PT não privatizou, mas fez concessões.""

 Fernando Haddad buscou relacionar o concorrente dele, Jair Bolsonaro (PSL), a ações tomadas pelo governo de **[Michel Temer](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/Michel%20Temer)**.

 ""O nosso projeto é fortalecer a Polícia Federal, o Ministério Público Federal, a Controladoria, o Judiciário. O meu adversário apoia o governo Temer, que é contra essas medidas"", disse o candidato.

 O petista afirmou ainda que Bolsonaro apoiou em todas as votações as pautas ""impopulares"" do governo Temer.

"Sorry, maybe I haven't made myself clear. It's not the mere existence of offensive views on CMV. I do, personally, think that posts advocating genocide and murder should be banned, but I *do* understand and appreciate the reasoning you gave for not doing so.

My issue, at this point, is more that it seems like the place where the most effort should be taken to ensure that a rule B violation has not occurred, and indeed perhaps where there should be a higher bar for *not* constituting a rule B violation, is precisely posts that advocate for things like genocide and mass murder. That a post advocating for mass murder and which seems to be, for all the same reasons as the genocide post, a textbook rule B violation, is still up seems like a problem to me.

Or, to put it another way: a responsibility inherent to operating a sub like this seems to be ensuring that the most heinous views are, in fact, being posted by people who are actually open to changing them; otherwise, the line between CMV and a sub where people go to post heinous views and NOT have them challenged (so, you know, a literal hate sub) starts to blur. *That's* what makes me wary about participating.

Plus the lizardman race is in dire dire need of some more customization options as they seem very bare bones and painfully basic for customization at the moment.

As for the price of the pack itself, when you consider the amount of items in such a pack it could be priced to about 30 or 40 dollars, but hey I would consider such a pack like this worth the price if they can pull off the amount of items inside the pack, especially if they can also pull off the quality and look of the items that you would receive from the pack.

Also granted Kunpaetku and Ashlotte might seem a bit much to go along with the pack, but I thought they would be a nice little bonus to help further promote the pack and maybe earn bamco a little extra cash."

"Well, I got several bullies when I was in elementary school. What I did, I always treat them well, One bully for 2nd and 3rd grade became my best friend in all my life until I got 18 and we went to different universities. Other bully became my friend too. I spent like five years with him, I used to go to his home on a daily basis. Other bully from the school not to me, pick a fight to me, I actually fight him back and realize that he didn't know how to fight (I guess that I learned to fight well from constant fights with bullies) I didn't beat him (because I felt pity for him) but scare the shit out of him

At some point in elementary school (last two years) I got pretty tough, and a lot of bullies backed me up, the ones I was friends with. One of the guys that I was pretty afraid of pick a fight with me in a dark  friday night, I remember I told my brother to go home (Implying that I liked him and that I wanted him to be safe in case the fight got out of control) He tried to fight me (he was really pissed because other guys told him that I said a bunch of stuff about him with the intention to makes us fight) he grabbed me by the neck, and we stood awkwardly in the middle of a street at night for five minutes until he realized it was stupid and went home. With this same guy I had a box fight and I beat him. He became very friendly in middle school and highschool (from being a rude jerk to a friendly and tolerant person).

So, basically there were a lot of bullies in my school and neighborhood. But, I coexisted with them even though they were jerks at the beginning. Somehow I always treat them like human beings, like friends... and eventually became friends with most of them. I don't consider my childhood that bad, since I learned so much and became tougher with time and more importantly, I got a more mature attitude than most of the people around me.

"Yeah its a bad idea to go from 0 to fent. 
Its lethal is very small amounts. Since u have no tolerence even if u dont OD it will likely be a shitty high. You will prob just vomit and want to scratch your skin off if you can keep your eyes open. 

I would say your friend would be a better source for help as he is an IV user. However his decision to give this to you with zero tolerence kind makes me think hes an idiot or a shit friend or perhaps both. 

If things go well what do u gain? A avergae high that could lead to a lifetime of misery. If things go wrong you could end up in the hospital or dead.

I dont think heroin or fent is something to be scared of but only after your very experienced with a high tolerence. At least you have a solid idea where your boundries are.

Extra stuff to do to prevent dental problems:
1. Get a prescription for Evoxac, Salagen or their generic equivalent from rheumatologist or dentist. They are meds that helps with saliva production. Saliva helps keep teeth clean.
2. Swish and drink water frequently.
3. Use dry mouth mouthwash, mouth spray and/or lozenges, all of which can be found in oral section of drugstores. 
4. Chewing gum helps produce saliva. Sugarless is best.
5. Get teeth cleaned at least twice per year. I also get fluoride treatment after each cleaning.  My dentist also offered prescription fluoride gel, but I don't want to brush my teeth with that each time after regular brushing because I'm concerned about receding gums (already have a little bit).
6. Reduce or eliminate consumption of sugary and acidic foods and drinks, and hard food. 
7. Brush teeth at least twice per day and floss at least once per day, but you probably already know that.  :)"
"&gt; Revoking citizenship really only applies to naturalized citizens

This is true for the U.S., but the U.S. allows dual citizenship so it doesn't matter. In countries that do forbid dual citizenship, they must have a means of revoking it from any citizen for whom it is forbidden, and they do allow such revocation, even from citizens by birth. 

If an adult with citizenship in Japan (which forbids dual citizenship for adults) asserts another citizenship in the presence of the Japanese government, Japan can unilaterally revoke it; it does not require that the citizen renounce that other citizenship. It may also allow the person to renounce all other citizenships in order to retain Japanese citizenship, in which case the Japanese government may require proof that this has been done, in the form of certification from those other governments.

Countries that forbid dual citizenship usually have specific provisions in their laws to accommodate cases where other countries forbid renunciation, typically by allowing the dual citizenship to be maintained. But if they wanted to, they could take a hard line; as long as they don't themselves disallow renunciation, there would be no contradiction in laws.

"I think the reason conservatives are acting this way is because, they know very deep down that a changing of the guard is happening soon. It seems to happen every 50 years or so, and the conservatives. Whom i don't consider actual conservatives, are trying desperately trying to strike down any liberal policy or idea popping up. The power and mandate regan left them is beginning to wain, and they are doing everything they can to prevent that from happening. Terrorism, to voter supression, to wanting to outright change the constitution to include regressive policy. 

&amp;#x200B;

When obama was elected, regressives and other true conservatives saw that everything they fought for. Whether or not it truly benefited  the country was in serious danger of being repealed and struck down. You know what they were right, they were right that liberals once they got in. They would strike down the republican policies, obama immediately set about tearing apart bushes legacy. Closing Guantanamo bay, ending the tax cuts, passing obamacare. All signaled a beginning of the end of conservative dominance over policy decisions. For the first time in about 20 years since even before bill clinton. They had fully controlled the house, the white house, and the senate. Meaning complete dominance over policy decisions. Which conservatives have had the pleasure of having for almost 20 years since 1980. 2008 changed everything in the political landscape and i argue is what is causing the political division today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conservatives became extremely radicalized after that time, the leaders of the movement doing so because of sinister reasons. The followers doing so because of having lost everything during the crash and needing new purpose. The Tea party when it rose was a combination of desperation, racism, power seeking, traditional people. Who didn't want to lose anymore, they wanted to prevent from kicked around any further. They drew a firm line in 2010, but by then it was too late. Obamacare had already passed, and alot of domestic policy decisions such as don't ask don't tell and the dodd frank law, were already pushed through. Meaning that Obama since jimmy carter became the first democrat to pass effective domestic policy reform. This was in historical eyes the beginning of the turning point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conservatives realizing this, became furious. All that talk about wanting to take the country back was because of this, they had never tasted such inglorious defeat before. They had lost control of the country, despite their victories in 2010, 2014, 2016. They know whats coming, bernie sanders and his political revolution, elizabeth warren and her followers. Are only the beginning of the end, of conservative dominance over the US. Those victories before are hollow, and have no true meaning behind them. With an aging out electorate and changing demographics, they could lose control of everything as early as 2020. And that is what conservatives are desperately trying to prevent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Simply put, they really lost their way big time. They used to be a respectful group, with good ideas and reasonable people. No more, the effective leadership is gone. Been so since the 90s,  fear and xenophobia have take over what was once a very respected and beloved party. Its a shame, republicans will probably in a few short years. Be practically banned from the white house for decades after trump's presidency. This has happened after andrew johnson, and herbert hoover. Historically speaking, trump compares to these presidents because of how bad he is. At how divisive he is, how damaging he is to our country and its interests. After his presidency, conservatives wont be able to recover for a long time.

He's not a charismatic President that wins you over, he's too confrontational for that.

The overall effect will be negligible at best. 

Though, he might hurt candidates that are in states where he's unpopular and their margin is close so those candidates might take the ""I'm my own man/woman"" type of attitude so they can politely decline his ""help"". 

But yeah the overall impact isn't going to be much help and any blunders or stuff that he's called out on hard is just going to hurt his side. Which with this particular President is going to be considered likely to happen. It's a bold strategy, something not a lot of political operators would have gone with considering that their outlook is bleak in the House races and the Senate seems to be not quite solid as they'd like it to be.

I wonder if Pyrrha's leg armor is actually what inspired the design of Yang's cybernetic. They certainly look similar, and I'm digging the black instead of brown in her color scheme. Also I kinda wonder if she was originally conceived as being more ""masculine"" given the wider shoulders and thinner hips, but that could very easily be just being *early* concept art.  I really like this design, but I could see it being more of a pain to animate than what we eventually got.

"Google (and elsewhere on this subreddit) has answers for this question in spades, hearts, diamonds, horseshoes and blue moons. That's a boring non answer, though. 

I can say for my campaigns that character backstory and relationships feature prominently in Session 0 talks. There are few things worse (YMMV) than having a group of people who all say, ""eh, I don't care about that person living or dying or achieving their dreams or accomplishing anything at all."" Even if an individual or the whole group's relationship changes over the course of play, it's helpful to have a starting point. 

Figure out a consensus on what people want out of play, in terms of combat versus puzzles versus social encounters, and also what players want individually. Averages are nice, but if you have extremes on any scale, someone is going to be disappointed by the middle road.  Sometimes it's easier to dedicate sessions or encounters to appeal to those extremes so those players are getting what they want / need. This also a good time to confirm what motivates everyone as a player and as a character. Do they want to level up super fast? Have super tough / interesting fights / boss fights? Explore lots of interesting places? Get involved in a political intrigue story? If you don't already know personally, this is a good time to find out. If you do know, it's still healthy that everyone voice this information ahead of time. 

You can also figure out the level of seriousness everyone wants - again as a group AND as individuals. The trope that D&amp;D campaigns invariably end up Monty Python* esque isn't a certainty, but one too many ""wouldn't it be funny if""s that become ""canon"" can irritate both DM and player over time. Better to figure that out ahead of time. 

And then there's all the boring ""real world"" stuff. What to do when people are missing, OOC knowledge and chatter protocols, bathroom breaks, etc.

"&gt; The fiction of the Bibke you may be speaking of would be considered a parable, stories used to get a point across to the narrow minded audience.

Yahweh literally identifies himself as the one who got them out of Egypt either in the 1st of the 10 commandments or right before it depending on which tradition for numbering them you use.

""I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments#The_Ten_Commandments

Except Exodus is entirely fictional. Not only is there no archaeological evidence for it, all the evidence we do have shows the Israelites were native Canaanites themselves and were never moved en masse into Egypt proper, like the Babylonian Exile, to even need an Exodus in the first place.

""The Israelite ethnic identity had originated, not from the Exodus and a subsequent conquest, but from a transformation of the existing Canaanite-Philistine cultures.[21]""

""Modern scholars therefore see Israel arising peacefully and internally from existing people in the highlands of Canaan.[23]""

"Because when you burst someone they take DH damage. When you play a LB or Syndra or whatever else that is so bursty, you want to burst people from 100 to 0, you need some extra damage to do that, and it doesn't matter whether it will activate like electrocute or once the enemy is past the 50% HP, because it still activates during your combo in a split second, you have to be pretty far behind not to burst someone atleast for 50% HP if you are an assassin. Base damage of DH is the same as Electrocute, ratios are a bit worse, but after 5 stacks the damage is always better, and those 5 stacks are basically you trying to burst anyone 5 times, you do that a lot more than 5 times in a game.

"I went no contact for a year in my early 20s. It was really hard at first and scary .. but then I learned real quick how to stand on my own two feet which wasn’t so hard when I removed the toxicity from my life. 

My life improved by leaps and bounds. My parents caught wind of my progress months in and actually started to try and make progress themselves to get back in my life. After a year or so I made contact and told them my boundaries and that if they wanted to start fresh then we could but if they crossed my boundaries then I’d have no problem never speaking to them again. 

They have worked tremendously hard to change. They’ve messed up and crossed some boundaries but I can now communicate it and they immediately apologize and work to not let it happen again.

My brother? Does not want to change. Is not abusing my parents who feel responsible for who he is. 

I have been no contact with him for almost a decade. Best decision, no regrets and my mom has just gone no contact w my brother. Now my dad is taking the brunt of it. I hope one day he will stop feeling guilty and put himself first. 

I realize not everyone’s situation goes as well as mine. But I’d have been just as ok to never speak a word to them again. I love myself too much to let the people who are supposed to protect me drag me down.

"The thing about Islam is its the newest of the Abrahamic religions, meaning we can actually attest to the fact that he existed and who he actually is. That said, figures in the New and Old Testament also serve as a historical record of the Israelites on top of providing a moral code. It's just that those stories are old as fuck and thus have no corroboration. Regardless, rational Jewish, Christian, and Muslim people aren't dismissing the historical genocide in their scripture as ""metaphorical"". They say it's real. But they also say it's artifacts of the times in which they happened as well as the times they were written down. 

Keep in mind genocide isn't one minor oopsie in the Old Testament: It's a constant and central theme. The Israelites glorfied and sought after it, and all the terrible things Muhammad did and said are simply an echo of that prior scripture. Considering we know the Israelite's religion today, chances are they did successfully slaughter the competition. 

Also, why are you holding up a dude from 600 AD to modern definitions of age of consent anyways? A dude marrying a young girl was not being a ""pedo"" a thousand and four hundred years ago. You want to talk about ""pedos""- how about the rape of children that is occurring in the Catholic church and buried by high church officials in 21st century? Was Pope Francis not meant to be a role model for other Christians? 

Yes: The old and new testament are old as hell and can't be fact checked. But they still do contain the history of the Jewish people. And based off the recorded history we have, the Jewish people lived under warlord pedo rapist kings that committed Genocide with pride. Muhammad fits in perfectly. He's an apple among apples."

Since I'm already here, I should mention another rule that'll explain why Furfrou was my first shiny. I didn't choose to SR for a starter (I'm way too impatient for that) so I instead opted to give myself a sort of ""wild card"" which I can use to find any type of Pokémon at any point in the game, without even having to use that type on the Z-Crystal! I decided on Floette (which means I'll still be able to find another fairy later on), but I was considering Bagon as I began because the idea of possibly getting a Salamence on Melemele just felt too novel.

Bad news was, I wanted to use SOS encounters to find shinies (such as the Furfrou), so I had to use Popplio and the event Rockruff to breeze through the first trial... At least Melemele was basically a tutorial, but it kinda sucked nonetheless. (And before you ask about Adrenaline Orbs, I had someone trade them over to me.)"

"&gt; The mass incarceration is, at this one point, one of the chief drivers of that poverty and poor education problem. 

And the poverty and poor education problem are the key drivers of the mass incarceration. I'd argue that wage stagnation has done more harm to multigenerational wealth growth than anything across the country, but that's another issue.

&gt;Has little to do with evil vindictive prosecutors and more to do with apathetic prosecutors that put their 9-5 in front of the damage.

I understand prosecutors have discretion, but they are the executive body that drives the blunt tool of criminal legislation. Saying the line prosecutors who put in 9-5 caused mass incarceration is like saying the person who installed the asbestos caused your cancer. The problem is legislative, and the solution is legislative.  

&gt;As for people who need to be in prison, there are certainly some, but they are a minority of those currently in prison

Using Texas as an example, [70% of the people in prison](http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/documents/Statistical_Report_FY2017.pdf) were there for a violent crime, a homicide, or a sex offense. More appropriately phrased, only 30% of the people in prison were there for a property or drug crime. 

, and most of the people who should be in prison should only be there for, say, a third or a fifth of the time they will do.

The average sentence of a violent offender in ""Hang 'em High"" Texas? 10 years. The average served sentence before release? 3. Would you propose they serve a year or less for a violent offense? We're going to have to agree to disagree on that one, especially in parole states. "

"I think you have completely the wrong mindset.

Being employable isn't about having jumped through X number of hoops, it's about having done something awesome and being able to show that off, something that shows dedication, talent, and value to a given company.

There's a lot of ways to break in: get a shitty QA job and move up, become a great artist, or coder. The easiest way is to know the right person at the right time, but you can't rely on that.

Develop your skills with the right tools, know what companies are hiring for. Learn something fuckign annoying no one else wants to learn, get really good at making hair, get great at running particle simulations, learn shaders, develop a skill that actually translates into making a good game. By some means (there are plenty of free demos) get your hands on some bleeding edge technology and watch some cutting edge tutorials and make really cool shit.

There are lots of ways you can schmooze into the industry, but if you're making this kind of post you're probably going to have to actually develop a skill that gets you in and it's' going to take a  while and be difficult, because the harsh reality is this industry takes every possible task and overcomplicates it and begs for more and more every single year.

Simply put, what do you offer that the other random applicant doesn't. In what way do you kick ass at making games? how can you be plugged into the pipeline and add value to the product?"

Instead the opposite should happen...*  *The end result here is that it's harder to control a lizardmen army that is already winning and easier to control one when control matters the most.  ""*

You nailed it. This gets to the heart of **why** rampage is happening in the first place. And it gets to the heart of how the lizardmen work as a species (or group of species). Falling into chaos because of damage taken and losing control because of a hunting instinct might seem to have the same effect, but the factor that initiates the effect is key.

There would definitely need to be some rebalance work done. But since rampage still exists it isn't like starting over from scratch. It would be more about play testing to see which stats to tweak. It's only my opinion but I think most units could stay fairly close to their current stat lines."

⏺Original argument was that tax dollars shouldn't be used to give veterans sex reassignment surgery. I then asked why they didn't want to support our troops.

⏺When I asked why they were annoying one said ""All of the trans people I know are annoying"" I then carefully explained how someone can be annoying and it has nothing to do with being trans. He then said ""Well the whole pride thing is really annoying"" Which I then compared to a loud and obnoxious sports fan (He's a big fan of sports). This shut him up.
⏺1 terf down, 1 more to go. The next one said trans people are insane because it is a mental disease called ""daisophoria"" I then asked him to define what that ment and he said ""the act of being trans"" I then corrected him by saying that it is pronounced dysphoria and explaining what it actually was. 
⏺This one still wouldn't shut up and all he could do was call me a ""libtard."" I then tell him that ""All republicans are racists."" He then gets super triggered and loses his shit sayong ""No! That's what the left want you to think! The Democrats are actually racists!"" Which I then respond with ""See how you didn't like being called racist?

Rotties are my favorite dogs so I love this story and can picture this scenario. The toys through the fence especially adorable! I’ve had two female Rottweilers. When I moved to Chicago with my first Rottie we lived into a two flat whose downstairs tenants had a huge young male Rottie. It was great for the dogs and they played all the time. She would get pissed at him when he accidentally hurt her when they were playing and go off. Quite funny to see an 80lb female absolutely dominate this big 140lb male. He was such a baby.

&gt;When fresh garlic is chopped or crushed, the enzyme alliinase converts alliin into allicin, which is responsible for the aroma of fresh garlic. The allicin generated is unstable and quickly changes into a series of other sulfur-containing compounds such as diallyl disulfide.

Trust me, you don't want the blue addative. You might think you do--but you *really* don't. 

Unless you've toned nearly white and are going for a blue steel look--youre just going to have green hair and not in a good way (more in a 'I wiped boogers in my hair' way) 

**And don't bleach over previous dye** Firstly (and most importantly) some have &amp; and don't list metallics as ingredients, and that's a great way to cause a chemical reaction that can do things like melt your hair off. Secondly, it's insanely damaging--dye can stay saturated in hair even if it *looks* faded--and can bleach unevenly as a result. 

* Always have deep conditioner on hand for after bleaching

* Don't bleach the same day you've washed/shampooed or bleached

* Follow directions for mixing/applying toner

"I totally agree! Through my twenties I was open on having kids. I thought maybe if I met a guy I fell in love with who I could see as a good dad and he wanted kids, if I (well, we) could have kids, great! If not, I was also excited about the right guy and a fun life of opportunities young married couples with children don’t always have. So I was open, but never felt I HAD to have kids. When I got to be about 32, I was like, “OK, real deal, do I NEED kids?” Not in an actual need way, but do I really want to experience pregnancy and birth? After some soul searching, the answer was no. Then I considered whether I was that big on having kids from a baby age. Because if I never get married, the adoption space is tight. I was actually surprised that my interest fell more in adopting children closer to 10 (where there is a lot of need) than any younger age. So, that made it easy for me to dust my hands and be perfectly content.

However, had I realized I WANTED to experience pregnancy, or have a newborn, I would have sat down with people I love to figure out more details of my next steps. I’d actually had a gay couple ask if I ever wanted kids, and what a coparenting relationship migh5 look like (they’d asked a handful of friends/single women), so I knew that was an option. Obviously donor was another. I’m sure there are others. 

So I can respect hitting an age where it’s shit or get off the pot time. For me, I was kind of surprised what my ultimate answer was. Though I guess being open in my twenties I never REALKY had that yearning. (Though I do think I’d be an OK mom and would love to maybe be a step mom.) 

My only advice to her is if you do want marriage and kids, you HAVE to stop with hanging around for “he’s not the one” relationships. Time truly is limited and you DO have a goal to find a husband/father. Don’t waste your time on anyone else! "

It's not THAT odd honestly, because everyone was hyper-vigilant after this morning and it turned out to not be addressed to her and be normal every day items.  They could have put that information at the top if that's what they wanted the take-away to be.  

Given the context of the day, I'd argue that the headline for this article is a little misleading (or click bait-like).  That's kinda my point here.  "

Have some teams already been confirmed (i.e. revealed through spoilers)?
"Don't forget Titan skating... bastards. Even more frustrating than chasing down a Hunter last season running Wormhusk.

But hey, the cool thing about macros is making them for shader deletion!"
Makeup.  I think makeup makes you look fake and ridiculous.  It's various stages of clown costume.  I don't think there's anything more appealing than bare skin.
very cool thank you theo
So today was my second day ever...
Papi Matthews is good with the kids too. Slap a C on him
I would imagine that both abrams and kemp both had pro speakers and speech writers coaching them though the campaign and even more so before the debate. I doubt that metz had the same.
"Had that happening loads to me recently, bugs are an absolute joke in this game, how they are so incompetent to fix these things is beyond me, rubberbanding has been in this game since it was released. "
"The other day the guy I am dating lost cell phone service (like the entire provider went down) and I had a massive internal struggle throughout the day. Can relate to a lot of these thoughts. Sure enough, he's been his usual affectionate and supportive self since he got service. Feels good but now I'm worried that he's seen my needy side cause I quadruple texted him throughout the day."
"If you're at the smaller end of the size scale, I personally like the following stores: 

Max, Decjuba, Portmans, Glassons, Pagani.  Jacqui E (occasionally dowdy, occasionally has gems)

If you're at the larger end: 

Crossroads, Autograph, K&amp;K, City Chic. Jacqui E &amp; Max if you're around a size 18.  

For both ends of the size range: Warehouse/Kmart for cheap things to trial new styles!

If you're willing to buy online: Asos has some really nice work wear, and a category for large bust.  I own their large-bust shirts and they're the only ones that don't do That Gap By The Buttons for me.  "
"I can't. I'm this way for life, now that I've experienced the other way of living.

Of I didn't have a kids and wife, I would probably be somewhere in the mountains living in the middle of nature."
"Yeah i know about switchers, but most of those ive found are for 2 inputs and doesnt work for 2 screens. Bought one of those before i knew it doesnt work both ways. I have one that is for 2 outputs but sometimes the screen goes black so i just gave up, i dont mind stretching down there, gotten so used to it. "

"I'm a sucker for a good magic system.

Lightbringer and Mistborn are absolutely fantastic in that regard. LB arguably moreso.

WoK's magic system is more a compliment to the world and it's characters rather than the primary focus, and could be considered weaker as a result...but frankly I really enjoyed the lesser emphasis on that system in the context of its series."
"Annoys me when they do that. They should call it a Netflix exclusive. Same reason why Yanks think Peaky Blinders is a Netflix show etc.

"It's weird that it's going to a fast busy after 7 digits.  Sure, it could do that if something was incorrectly configured but if you're saying nothing major has changed in 10 months that's probably not it.  Not unless one of those new extensions is weird and that's causing it to act up but that's probably not it.  I've not done much with CME (we had a stable, functional CME instance that was just for failover so I didn't really touch it).  Mostly basing this off my experience with full CUCM.  Really sounds like some sort of routing or dial peer issue.  No changes to dial peers?  

Question, is this under support now?  If so I'd get a TAC case opened with Cisco, they will get it sorted out really quick.  I'd call them rather than raise the ticket online and put it in as a P1 ticket if I were you.

If you don't have support you can send me a before and after of the config via PM and I can take a look.  No guarantees I'll figure it out but happy to take a look and see if anything jumps out.    "

"Here’s the deal.

You believe in a creator that created a world knowing who would live a good life and who would live a bad life.

He created everything knowing how all things would end. Thus, he created humans he knew would go burn in hell forever.

The whole idea of “accepting the lord Jesus Christ as your savior” puts the idea out there that there is a choice.

But how could an all powerful all knowing god actually give people free choice?

As a former evangelical, I know that in scripture, it actually tells us that god has chosen those who will spend eternity with him.

That mean you worship a god that knowingly created people that are condemned to burn forever because he made them that way.

By believing what you do, you worship a god that is our definition of evil. 

Hate to break it to you, but your god is lot lore like satan than Jesus. "

"Okay, first off: Your therapist needs to respect that you want to take this in your own time, at your own pace. This isn’t something you should rush. I’m JUST getting ready to consider HRT and I have been battling this as early as 2013, if not earlier. If she continues to be that way and it makes you uncomfortable, find another therapist.

That said, if you’re *really* interested in exploring this (hate to qualify this, but I’ve seen too many TERFs/gender critics say the same things), here are a couple of things I did that helped:

- Do things on the opposite end of the gender spectrum and see how it makes you feel.  Doesn’t have to be huge.  For example, I cut my hair shorter and shorter until I got the sides buzzed for the first time on my latest visit, I wear men’s deodorant, I lift weights to feel more masculine, and I wear a binder when I can and try to present as masculine as possible, androgynous when I can. I also plan to wear more male clothing once I am in a financial position to do so.  You can do this at home when you’re alone or in your room - just make sure to lock the door if you live with others.

- Get involved with your local LGBT/queer community.  A lot of people have had the exact same issues you’re dealing with, and might have some helpful tips. It might also be a great place for experimenting with gender identity, pronouns, and presentation.

- I’m not going to say “If you think you’re trans, you are.”  I’m going to say “Only *you* can say with any certainty whether or not you’re trans.” At the end of the day, only one person’s opinion matters, and that’s yours.

- TERFs/gender critical feminists were people I listened to for a long time.  I almost ended up getting an ambulance called on me because of it.  I won’t say don’t read their stuff, but remember that it can be *so incredibly toxic*.  For me, at least, it did nothing but worsen both my dysphoria and denial.

Hope this helps, apologies if I come off like a jackass."
"I told my buddy straight to his face I had been banging his fiance for 6 months the night before his wedding. Nobody ever asked me straight up so I hadn't said anything.

For the love of God Kinsler get a hit
"Usually, curiosity is a good thing. It is good to want to learn things. However,  
&gt;It’s making me depressed and making me have anxiety. Please tell me how I will stop?

"Well, to be clear, I noted that 

&gt;  it seems to be a popular approach to treating high-risk sex offenders

which is distinct from the claim that it is *effective*.  It is shockingly difficult to assemble data on this matter; as [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0050310/) observes, 

&gt; We concluded that further randomised controlled trials are urgently needed in this area, so that society is not lured into a false sense of security in the belief that once the individual has been treated, then their risk of reoffending is reduced. Currently, the evidence does not support this belief.

Because I am not myself a psychologist, and have not done any serious philosophy of psychology in several years, I am reluctant to make strong claims about the state of psychology--one thing I enjoy about SSC is that it keeps me at least marginally informed in this area.  But it is certainly my *impression* that contemporary psychology is popularly viewed as adjunct to physical medicine, i.e., there are ""mental illnesses"" that have ""treatments"" (and perhaps ""cures"") in much the way that there is ""physical illness"" that has ""treatments"" and ""cures.""  Not only is this a not-great characterization of *physical* medicine, it appears to be *mostly false* as a view of psychology and psychiatry.  To the extent that psychology and physical medicine are at all analogous, psychologists appear to be in approximately the ""bleed 'em with leeches"" stage for a pretty wide variety of issues.

So when people start talking about bio-hacking or psych-hacking paraphilias (whether to ""cure"" them or whatever), it makes me very nervous.  In the case of people who criminally offend, the incentives to either *pretend* that there are reliable treatments, or actually *convince* yourself that there are reliable treatments, is super high.  On the other end, in the case of (now) merely non-normative sexual issues like homosexuality, the CW incentives to either *pretend* that sexual proclivities are totally immutable, or actually *convince* yourself that sexual proclivities are totally immutable, are also super high.  In the case of pedophilia you can at least gesture broadly to something like ""even if we can't change your desires, we are justified in regulating them or even trying to 'cure' them in harsh ways, so as to prevent harm to innocent children who are not capable of consent.""  But a lot of people are also very strongly averse to bestiality or necrophilia or the like, none of which have the harm-prevention explanation readily available unless we accept the paternalistic ""paraphilias are self-harm"" line.  The end result is a mess of double-think and cherry-picking fetishes for social approval: are sexual proclivities ""treatable,"" or aren't they?  When the most common answer turns out to be ""the ones that *happen* to be inside the Overton window are totally natural and immutable, but the ones that *happen* to be outside the Overton window can probably be cured, at least in theory,"" this makes me very suspicious."

"That's a great starting point.  If you've never really done photography before it will have plenty of setting for you to play around with but it is also relatively simple enough that you won't be overwhelmed.  If you really get into it, you might want to eventually upgrade but that won't be for a while.  By the time you reach that point, you will have a much better idea of what kind of photos you shoot and what you want out of a high end camera.

For me personally, I mostly use wildlife as my subject matter.  If you go that route, just sitting in your backyard taking pictures of birds and insects as they come by can be a great starting point.  /r/photography can be a helpful resource if you find yourself wanting to learn more.  

Just keep in mind that photography is an art and like any art when you are first learning you might find yourself disappointed in your product not matching what you see others produce.  Don't worry about that and just do the best you can.  Everyone started at that point but some people have the dedication to stick with it.  With time, you might find yourself producing photos that you are proud to show off."

If you had it prior (like during Guard or Reserves period) and just got the scrip filled after getting activated, that doesn’t really count.

"I might try that comp with Elad, since wind should be able to not be stunned as much against water. Normally if the enemy Mo Long goes, he uses 3rd skill and only has a 22% chance to proc (which is hard to believe, but that's what we know.

&amp;#x200B;

Using Icares has 1 huge advantage, and that is the turn after killing with third. Let's say like in this case, Trianna healed instead of attacking Mo Long. Then Icares could not kill Trianna, but Mo Long can. But, because enemy Mo Long took so much damage, the Trianna could not heal him enough to dodge the Icares 3rd skill. So I can use Mo to nuke Trianna and Icares to nuke Mo Long. This goes smoothly when the RNG is balanced."

"&gt;The 'proper' YNAB way is to budget the money directly to next months' categories instead of dealing with a 'buffer' category.

It is indeed ""recommended by YNAB"", but ""proper"" is debatable. Doing so allows funds to be accidentally pulled back into the current month without obvious indication it's happened (since the current TBB == $0). A fair few people have gotten to next month only to see the new TBB with a negative value.

Shuffling money into next month via a category absolutely prevents this situation."

"Give her the condoms. She'll do it whether misinformed or informed - it's way better to have her informed about safety, health and using protection.

Also tell her that she can help prevent UTI's by peeing just after sex (as in running to the bathroom right after), as so many girls and women don't know this. It's so easy and simple when it comes to preventing a really uncomfortable experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't rat her out, but give her a good talk about consent and sex. Explain your concerns (in a non judgemental way) that you don't feel she's ready, but give her all possible tools so she can figure out HERSELF if she's ready or not. By learning more about sex, what it entails, safety side of stuff etc, she might even make her own decision to wait. If she doesn't though, at least she'll go in informed."

"There were lots of American vehicles with hand-operated handbrakes, though...usually with a handle underneath the dashboard that was pulled towards you, and then released.

"It's not an all or nothing gamble, it's a sliding scale. You don't need to be as big as Johnny Depp to consider yourself successful in your acting pursuits, nor is that amount of success required to make a decent living. You don't need to sell albums like Drake or Rihanna to make money from music. You certainly need to commit yourself 100% to your craft if you want to maximize your success though. You can really half ass your journey in a lot of normal safer careers and get by, but in entertainment or similar arts, or even things such as starting your own businesses or companies or similar, you cannot pursue these things without obsession and expect anything great in return. 
 
A huge majority of people who never make it, at least in music because that's where my experience is, are the ones who compare themselves to the very few at the top and use that as the basis of its impossibility, and so they never even attempt their initial goals in the first place. And then they preach that others shouldn't try either, because they never really tried, but they present it like they tried themselves. But they never did. 
 
It's exactly the same as everyone being afraid of friends and family taking risks in pursuing things they're actually passionate about, because they assume if they personally couldn't do it, then their friend or family member won't be able to do it either. It's a self fulfilling prophecy. 
 
There is nothing wrong at all with taking a much more secure and safer path and pursuing a life of something you have no passion in, and especially if you get lucky and find happiness in that job or your life elsewhere, but it's poisonous to try to discourage others from even trying before they've ever started just because there's so few millionaires in entertainment. There are many, many income levels in between poverty and mountains of cocaine in these industries. But you only hear about the people at the top, because they are the most popular. "

"I disagree with your analysis. The male gender role absolutely makes women feel safe. Things like height and strength are attributes that women desire that inherently makes them feel safe. Same thing with dominance, leadership and mental fortitude. It absolutely makes women feel safe, mentally and physically so to speak. 

Any and all qualities that provide a safe and resourceful environment to raise children will make a man attractive. 

Why do you think women tend to desire height and strength? 

Nobody is advising women to change any social dynamics here. I don’t want to put the cat back in the bag. I want to maximize my own happiness in this life and to do that, I am required to maintain a masculine presence. 

Women do not like cowardice, nor submission. It is what it is. "
"&gt; You define it however you want, it will always be wrong.

So you say people charge ""more than their product is worth"" but you don't have any way to decide what it's worth. So how can you even begin to make a statement like that?

3.79 ft^3 • 7.48 gal/ ft^3 = 28.3 gal

"Now, to get the party started by offering my initial answers:

1. Reggae
2. Fusion music played on real instruments (not purely electronic music), combining influences from any two or more different ethnic cultures, anywhere in the world (not just places like Africa, Latin America, and Jamaica, but also Norway, Russia, China, and wherever else.)
3. My band is tackling this question right now, so I can provide you with two examples from our own quiver...

Charmas calls ""The Maple Leaf For Shredders"" Canadian Surf Rock, not because I visit a lake in Canada every summer, and not because of the song's ""sound"" either, but rather because of its SOURCE CONTENT. The melody was derived from a Great Highland Bagpiper's version of Canada's original National Anthem (The Maple Leaf Forever), transposed from a major key into a modal key (common in surf music), given a classic surf rock groove with cool chords, and played with enough folk melody instruments to give it a ""World Music"" flavor. The vocals are also Canadian, because...well...the Great Lakes have a gnarly shorebreak! [The Maple Leaf For Shredders On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2tVOvZS9WSPRGJuCdLalal?si=sb-KDEPYQkCNA_WB_zNI6w) 

By contrast, Charmas calls ""Memories in the Wind"" World Music because of HOW IT WAS COMPOSED. This tune began as a very crooked, extremely slow, new age tune composed by a jazz guitarist. I composed a straight Celtic melody (a reel) to accompany the jazz tune. Then I subtracted some notes to convert my tune from Celtic to sounding more abstract. Shortly afterward it turned out that the jazz guitarist was not going to join our band, so then I ditched his chords (so as not to plagiarize), and handed my naked tune over to a Celtic guitarist, with no explanation (including nothing about the crooked beat-count of the original chords). The Celtic guitarist then came up with his own chords that were entirely different (nearly opposite in some ways to the original chords), and with a shockingly different beat-count. It was still a slow, dreamy tune, until our bass player decided it needed a Scottish rock groove. Also, he misinterpreted the guitarist's altered beat-count in a really cool way (and I didn't say anything, because I loved how it was evolving), which he explained to our kit drummer using some bizarre mathematics. Then we brought in an Irish bodhran drummer, an African percussionist, a ragtime keyboardist, etc. and everyone conspired to create a tune that sounds like it could be from anywhere and nowhere you can put your finger on.

"If you actually look at the MLA report, you'll see that Korean enrollments have grown by 95% over 10 years, while most modern European languages have decreased by about 15%, and ancient languages have decreased by over 40%. Sure, most modern European languages have a larger number of learners now, but that's just because they started with a much larger base. Popularity is not just about which has the most people, it's also about which is growing the fastest. And if these trends continue over the next 20 years, then we could see Korean overtake Russian/Italian, although probably not the core Spanish/French/German.

ASL and Arabic are the only other growing languages, and it looks like Arabic peaked around 2013 because of 9/11. Japanese and Chinese are holding steady, they don't have the same explosive growth as Korean.

From an economic standpoint, Spanish is the worst language for English speakers to learn. There are so many Spanish native speakers who are also fluent in English living in USA, so there's not much economic need for native English speakers to learn Spanish as a foreign language. The main advantage of learning Spanish is that it's the easiest foreign language for Americans to learn, because it's really easy to find native Spanish speakers all over the US. For pretty much all the other languages you have to go to big urban centers to find people speaking something other than English/Spanish. Spanish has the biggest number because it's the easiest language that college students can do to fill graduation requirements, and also because it's the easiest language to major in. Most universities provide upper level electives for Spanish, but they don't necessarily have upper level electives for other languages."

I started my PC gaming experience on the original COD and BF1942 but I started gaming way back on Atari playing Cobra Commander and Pong.

It used to be: here is your game, pop that sucker in and once you beat it, it was finished. The best event to happen to that game was an expansion which generally meant hours of additional fun content. Now we have games being purchased in early access, open betas and other ways to gain access to a game nowhere near finished and polished.  Not to mention how many of these games never actually take off and emerge out of early access. 

What strikes me as the worst for gamers in this day and age is the loss of content through playtime. It used to be that an accomplishment in game meant you got great loot.

Hello!

I'm a hacker who cracked your email and device a few months ago.
You entered a password on one of the sites you visited, and I intercepted it.

Of course you can will change it, or already changed it.
But it doesn't matter, my malware updated it every time.

Do not try to contact me or find me, it is impossible, since I sent you an email from your account.

Through your email, I uploaded malicious code to your Operation System.
I saved all of your contacts with friends, colleagues, relatives and a complete history of visits to the Internet resources.
Also I installed a Trojan on your device and long tome spying for you.

You are not my only victim, I usually lock computers and ask for a ransom.
But I was struck by the sites of intimate content that you often visit.

I am in shock of your fantasies! I've never seen anything like this!

So, when you had fun on piquant sites (you know what I mean!)
I made screenshot with using my program from your camera of yours device.
After that, I combined them to the content of the currently viewed site.

There will be laughter when I send these photos to your contacts!
BUT I'm sure you don't want it.

Therefore, I expect payment from you for my silence.
I think $883 is an acceptable price for it!

Pay with Bitcoin.
My BTC wallet: 1DVU5Q2HQ4srFNSSaWBrVNMtL4pvBkfP5w

If you do not know how to do this - enter into Google ""how to transfer money to a bitcoin wallet"". It is not difficult.
After receiving the specified amount, all your data will be immediately destroyed automatically. My virus will also remove itself from your operating system.

My Trojan have auto alert, after this email is read, I will be know it!

I give you 2 days (48 hours) to make a payment.
If this does not happen - all your contacts will get crazy shots from your dark secret life!
And so that you do not obstruct, your device will be blocked (also after 48 hours)

Do not be silly!
Police or friends won't help you for sure ...

p.s. I can give you advice for the future. Do not enter your passwords on unsafe sites.

I hope for your prudence.
Farewell."

"Because the driver of a 4 time superheavyweight champion has no chance against donald hudson. Unless its still not the driver of ziggy, in which case i dont know.

as for the tournament, i feel like the full wedge would stand up to sow, but more testing would be needed, megabyte is strong but i dont know how strong. Sawblaze its either or, the dustpan is a huge issue but flippers are probably sawblazes worst matchup, tombstone was knocked down more than sow was but more testing would be needed, not thatd face tombstone anyway because theres no way that bombshell isnt bottom. if lucky can get under bite force i could see them doing really well, of they dont theyd lose pretty badly. They shouldve won the JD against touro max, same goes here. If huge doesnt break they just lose. Monsoon i have no idea. Rotator no idea but that wedge is solid. They beat icewave. And witch doctor. And warhawk. With bronco it depends on how long the spatula in addition to ground clearance. Whiplash probably wins not gonna lie."

"I was about your age when I did it.  Though, really, I just had to avoid my mom, so maybe it was easier.  My Dad comes from a family of narcs, but is not a narc himself.  His brother and sister are, and his mother was, and I'm pretty sure my aunt's oldest daughter is.  (These are people I want as little to do with as possible.  The only one I really miss on my Dad's side is my Grandpa.  He was a good man.  I also worry for my aunt's youngest, because she's basically you, though I don't know her very well.)  I think the whole reason my Dad was attracted to my Mom in the first place is that she's a narc and that was familiar to him.  My Dad left when I was about 12 and remarried when I was a teenager, so I went to him first.  They put me up in my step sister's room for about a week, while she was at college.  (She was not happy about that, and that's a whole other story, but that's why I couldn't stay.)  After that, I was living in an efficiency apartment and discovering that I had developed PTSD.

The sooner you can get out, the better.  The longer you stay, the more damaged you're going to get.  Fifteen years later and I'm still dealing with the damage.  Also, don't give them a heads up or they will sabotage you.  Make sure you have all your important documents.  If you can move stuff out in advance and stash it somewhere, probably a good idea.  Know that whatever you leave behind will be up for grabs, so take what is important to you.  (I didn't plan in advance, so some favorite belongings got e-bayed and tag sale-ed, but that's the price of freedom.)  If you have a safe place to land, just go for it.

When you go no contact, stay no contact.  It'll change the family dynamic later when they realize you really can just leave.  Also, you really need the break for your mental health.  Good luck to you and godspeed.  :)

The Almaz (Russian: Алмаз, ""Diamond"") program was a highly secret Soviet military space station program, begun in the early 1960s.

Three crewed military reconnaissance stations were launched between 1973 and 1976: Salyut 2, Salyut 3 and Salyut 5. 

To cover the military nature of the program the three launched Almaz stations were designated as civilian Salyut space stations.

Salyut 2 failed shortly after achieving orbit, but Salyut 3 and Salyut 5 both conducted successful manned testing.

"I think thats a bit unrealistic. Minorities vote democrat because the democratic ideology focuses on minorities and the disadvantaged, both historically and presently. There is a strong loyalty there that will be hard to break. The democrats actively maintain this base.

The conservative ""pull yourself up by your own bootstraps"" point of view isn't about race or gender or the disadvantaged. Its about individual competency regardless of those things. Equality of opportunity, not outcome. 

I think a lot of minorities believe they are disadvantaged because of their race, and the democrats are the ones telling them: yes, that is so, and we will help you.

Yet it's not enough to produce it - you actually need to sell what you produce. And distribution/marketing is a completely different thing. Where Daimler AG has almost 100 years of creating it's brand value which is enormous and a long history of fails/success operating on different markets - Autovaz has 20 years of crisis managment as long-term consequences of the USSR collapse. And they don't have a marketing/R&amp;D/production budget of Daimler or WV or any other leading car producer to compete with them globally but instead they have serious political risks. To expect from them a massive expantion it's like asking a star from the sky. They still hold strong positions on Russian market regardless tough competition (there are 4 foreign car plants only here near StPetersburg- Ford, Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan) and that's already success for them.

right before a match starts you go into the Channel "" Solo Countdown"" than a bot will be joining and he will say stuff like ""match starting in 1minute""  and if the scrim is starting the bot will make a countdown and if he says go you just search for an match at the same moment.

then you can type the last 3 digits of your Code (Its a white number in the top left in the game) and type it in the Solo Codes channel you dont really need to do that some people also dont do that. but it helps to see how many people are in your match. if you got into an trash lobby with like only 1 other guy there will be an reqeue a minute after the match started you just need to go into the channel again

Like what?
just that watching the 2 series is kind of a difference. Tbh I wouldn't be surprised if g2 takes down ig since gameplay doesn't matter that much this season but rather teamfighting. But even there When I look at the series between g2 and rng it has been a much lower level than ig vs kt. G2 plays the perfect style against rng and rng choked. At least that's how I see it from what i saw in the games. I expect a 3:1 for Ig or something like that. But as I said already I wouldn't be surprised if it goes like 3:2 for g2 either cus this worlds is crazy. P/b matters hella lot this year and gameplay less. And g2 is by no means bad at teamfighting. When they get an early lead they take the game and same for Ig pretty sure. But generally I see Ig having the better early game.

Title: **Mom's husband stole my identity -- a WHILE ago**

Original Post: 

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So, I'm not positive if I can even do anything, and I'm not expecting to be able to. But I'm not ready to give up on this until options are in fact exhausted.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the story: I started college in 2009, and my ""step dad"" (not legally adopted) helped me with the FAFSA and enrollment processes. He explained to me that I'd be getting refunds if I had money left over, and I waited patiently for those for a couple of \*years\* just assuming I didn't get any refunds.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Two years later, I finally inquire about the missing refunds and I spoke to my FinAid office. They gave me a list of log-ins and transactions pertaining to my account (which was apparently handled by a third party bank) that revealed my step dad's email addresses as the log-ins. A few thousand dollars were siphoned out of this account over those two years.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Step dad (or ""D"") denied it when I confronted him, and then said ""I took it because I felt like you owed me"" in the same conversation. I was 19 by this point. My credit report also had a credit card out in my name, most likely his doing as well. I was at least able to get that removed with a written letter.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; D had been found to have been stealing physical items from me as well, such as magazine subscriptions (he hid a year's worth of mags behind his bookshelf), gift cards, cash from my wallet, a Nintendo DS that he claimed he lost, and even opened my mail and took the debit card that had my financial aid refunds. I didn't know it even arrived back in 2009.
&gt; 
&gt; I contacted my college again recently, and they claimed they were incapable of finding those same records and that they wouldn't provide them anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; I also didn't press charges at the time due to my mother being disabled and unable to work, and I wasn't able to find any for myself while going to school. Wouldn't have been wise to get rid of our only source of income. I was foolish.
&gt; 
&gt; Based on what I can gather from the depths of my panic-riddled mind, this is the summary.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It has been 7 years and five months since he and I had that confrontation, and roughly 9 years and five months since if all started.
&gt; 
&gt; Any hope for taking legal action to, if nothing else, acquire some closure?
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;

"I am not a doctor, but I can share what I remember hearing and reading from when my brother had AML. It really depends on what form of leukemia Roman has. There are four main types of leukemia, two chronic and two acute. The chronic and acute forms each affect either myeloid or lymphocytic blood cells, which just refers to how much development the cells have gone through. Myeloid cells are younger and less developed.

I haven't seen any word on what it is he has, but it was likely had one of the two chronic forms of leukemia (because those are less life-threatening and he is alive) the first time around. If he has one of those again, his outlook is much better. In chronic forms, blood cells have more opportunity to mature than in acute forms (the 'A' in AML comes from acute).

If he does have an acute form, it is not good. If he had an acute form before and an acute form now (which would be unlikely because he likely would not have gone into remission and survived this long without it reappearing and killing him), it's very bad news because his body will be less likely to stave off a recurrence after chemo eliminates existing blood cells.

**If any of this is incorrect, please correct me. I don't claim to be an authority, I'm just recalling what I can and it may need clarification.**

**edit to shed some light on ""chances"":** I have seen five-year survival rates for chronic leukemias in the 80-90% range and acute types to be in the 20-30% range. My brother I mentioned at the beginning did die about 17 months after diagnosis and multiple rounds of chemotherapy. He had the acute myeloid type, the worst of the bunch. I am not sure how these rates are determined, but I imagine they are some how weighted to emphasize those with median access to treatment. Roman will obviously be getting the best of the best, which makes a world of difference with cancer in general, as treatment is improving all the time. 

These rates should **not** be taken fully to heart as a strong indicator of what is going to happen. There are all kinds of variables that could make him fall in the more likely scenarios or the less likely scenarios. Don't try to analyze and predict. Let professionals do what they can and hope."

Leaving the IP on as a slow cooker.. IDK. It has a lot more potential to have issues. A crock pot never seals enough to build pressure if something goes wrong and the heating elements generally don't get high enough to really do much but burn the food if it dried out. If the IP failed and somehow presurized for 12 hours and the safety features went awry... it's a worst case scenario but it could be bad.

Also, there was a batch of IP's that were melting during normal use lol... so I feel like there's more complicated stuff and more potential to break, so IDK if I would leave one unattended or not. "

"Teresa halbach murder It’s starts with Avery making the call to auto trader asking for Teresa to come out to take photos. This was done to start the trail leading to his property. Teresa pulls up and takes the photos. After that she returns to the car to leave. Steven walks over to the car and with his good looks and charm convinces her to come in for some drinks. No college hotty can refuse that. 

As soon as she gets in the trailer he attacks her. Handcuffs her to the bed. He then goes and gets Brendan to participate in the raping of Teresa. They take turns. Then Steven stabs her in the stomach. She screams. So he slits her throat and opens up a gaping wound in his hand. He’s bleeding from the hand. She’s bleeding and won’t die so they take her to the garage while she’s still breathing after having her throat slit. She just won’t die so the shoot her with a 22 rifle. Finally she’s dead. 

So they grab the rav4 throw her into the back as hard as they can so that blood can be flung onto the back door. Brenden walks to the back of the trailer where the 10 foot bomb fire is. And Steven gets into the RAV and drives to the back of the trailer. Why carry her body to the back, it’d be easier then driving her in her car to the back, but they fat lazy bastards and would rather drive. So he pulls around with Teresa bloodied body. I mean bloody. A gun shot to the head, a slit throat, and a knife wound to the stomach. By that time all of her blood should have poured out her wounds. The house, garage, RAV4, and the walkway to the garage should be covered. So they take her body out and toss it in the fire with some tires. 

4 hours that body should be vaporized so they go and stash the rav4 in the junkyard (Brendan walks because there’s zero evidence that places him in that car or fucking anywhere while this was taking place) and make it look like they trying to hide the car but not really. Using a car crusher crosses their minds, but how will anybody find the car and all that blood and sweat evidence if they do that. 

After hiding(not hiding) the RAV4 Steven goes to open up the hood to remove the cable from the battery so nobody takes this car off the property. Stupid Steven leaves all his sweat DNA all over the hood latch even tho his hand is full of his blood and Teresa’s. Amazingly he got zero blood on the steering wheel or gear shifter or door handle. 

Ohh Steve goes back inside the RAV to shake some of the dry blood flakes onto the floorboard. Thinking that would throw off the cops. His hand was actively bleeding so there’s no way he could have left dry blood in the car. Make it look like someone framed him. 

So Steve and Brendan go back to the trailer to clean and smell the body being burned to dust. But nobody else. Because we all know that when bbqing meat the smell doesn’t radiate for miles. 

Not only does Steve run a dirty junk yard,but he also a professional crime scene cleaner on the side. So they clean and clean make sure every millimeter of blood is removed from every wall, shoe, sock, mattress, bed frame, carpet, and ceiling. I mean everything all while leaving the house a fucking wreck. A dirty slobby wreck. They also was able to clean all the blood in the garage and off all the junk and dirty/dusty equipment and spare car parts. They were so good at it that they could remove all the blood from an engine block without removing the dirt, grease, and grime that is caked on it. 

Then after being the worlds most gifted crime scene cleaners they returned to the bomb fire and find what’s left of Teresa. There’s very little that remains. I mean the bomb fire was the size of the Hiroshima bomb. Burned her up quick. So they take what little bones and throw them into a burn barrel and place the barrel over by the dasseys trailer. You know why? Just because they can. 

So it’s almost done. Steven goes into the house and hides the key. You know good enough that if someone search the house 6 times they would never find it, but not good enough if some cop who withheld evidence in a previous case against you came in and looked for it. After thinking about it. Steven forgets he need to take Teresa’s day planner back to her house. Just so her ex stalker bf would know what she had planned in the coming days. 

Then the volunteers show up. Can we search your property without a warrant. Sure you can. Just don’t walk directly to the RAV4 that is made to look like it’s trying to be hidden with two branches and a hood. Steve did such a good job on the house cleanup that he doesn’t want people finding out what a piss poor job he did with the RAV4. 

That’s what really happened! Prove me wrong! murder scene"

"Some 1984 and Harry Potter Spoilers:

If we were to take a story like 1984, even if we agree with the premises of the story (highly simplified: totalitarianism is bad), the story itself can not be used as evidence that totalitarianism is bad because it is a fictional anecdote where the world has been constructed around the idea of the theme.

On an even more fantastic scale, if we go with Harry Potter and the PhiloStone where love is the almighty power that defeats the enemy, what I'm saying becomes more obvious. The world has been constructed in such a way that love wins. For that reason, it can not be used as proof."
"What units are you using? You need to rely on minor factions for your land army and should be prioritizing researching the techs that increase the number of minor factions you can assimilate. 

If dust production is an issue, reassign some of your cities' population towards generating dust while you research techs for buildings that can increase your dust. Search more ruins to get more dust. Sell off any resource or units that you don't need. Also note that units controlled via the morgawr's catspaw ability have a higher dust upkeep cost so avoid controlling them longer than necessary."

Why go with 1.12 talents and progressive itemization? Doesn't that still fly in the face of some peoples expectations of having the earlier content retain its original difficulty?
The answer is 1.12 talents and 1.12 gear. Raids and other content can be scaled to provide a familiar challenge. "

"They’re usually frequent flyer patients that tend to not get better unfortunately.  

I remember one patient who had CRE and C DIFF and his huge Italian family.  They were all very nice but totally didn’t understand what to do about infection control.  Like they would be swooning all over the whiny patient and then come out to the nursing station in their gowns (or they would have taken the gown off but not washed their hands) to get the nurse for something.  It was so frustrating and scary because they truly didn’t get how important the infection control aspect was for the staff and other patients.  And even if you explained it to one or two family members, you had like ten more who totally didn’t understand it and you’d be back to square one.

We ended up putting up signs at the top of the door as your leaving the patients room (opposite of normal contact precaution signs) saying things like “please wash your hands with soap AND water when leaving room” “please don’t wear plastic gowns outside of the room”, etc. it was ridiculous.

And the thing is, it’s patients like this that just spread this crap around and it’s so gross.  I feel bad their family member has such a bad infection but it’s scary how now seriously it’s taken.  And I even had doctors or nurses not have any idea what it was or how dangerous it is."

"I had totally forgot about credit unions. The Coast capital free checking account does seem enticing. I wont be able to take advantage of the 200$ promo as I might not be able to open the account soon enough. 

The HSBC promo does not see to have any other products attached to it. I was just gonna use it for the 12 months (maybe 13 months for good measure) and then close the account after that.  500$ return on 10,000$ seems like a nice 5% to me. 

Can you tell me what products you think are attached that I will end up paying for?

The HSBC newcomer package also offers me a mastercard so I can start building up Credit history and score. That seemed like another good advantage. I have no idea how else to start a credit score.

"Me?  What makes you think I'm sensitive?  

It's not that I'm sensitive, and it's not that the mods are sensitive.  It's generally considered bad etiquette to tell someone to go kill themselves.  

I get it.  You think it's tongue and cheek humor.  Like, you don't really mean it.  It's just a jab that you do.  For fun.   It's funny.  

But that's only your perception.   

When you tell someone to kill themselves, what does the person think whom you told?  How do they feel?  Are they sensitive to those words?  Are they suicidal?   

You don't know.  Especially on the internet.   

Now.  You said the words.  You were the asshole.  That means you are responsible for saying them.  You are responsible for the consequences of saying them.  Whether it hurt someone's feelings, or they actually do take your advice.  You're responsible for that.  You're also responsible for getting banned because you said them.  

Fact is, you can't be an asshole and then blame others when they are hurt or because you got external consequences like getting banned, your girlfriend leaving you, or your family that won't talk to you.   All those things can happen if you act like an asshole.  

Ergo, if you're going to say something, own it.  Own what happens.  Your words and actions have consequences.  Some good.  Some bad.  It's really that simple.  "

"The French stepped in to help at the end of the American revolution once they were sure which side was going to win. The French and English are very old rivals, I'm sure the French government loved an opportunity to punch England right in the colonial holdings. Most of western civilization is standing on the shoulders of the colonial period when lesser countries were exploited for the benefit of the colonial powers.

The results of European immigration have me against unchecked immigration in general. It looks like inviting in a massive amount of refugees from a fucked up country makes your country a worse place to live. Violent crime and rape statistics are through the roof in europe. Police are too scared to go into the immigrant ghettos of Sweden/UK/Germany. The resulting danger from mass immigration also gives the government a reason to implement more of a police state. As a Texan I live and work with tons of Legal immigrants, they help make Texas the power house of econmic growth it is today. They contribute to society and are not a burden on the welfare system. Free for all immigration from south america will fuck up the south west united states just like it has done to Europe.

"And a cheap dash clock that still has the time sticker on it. Also, no alarm function. Why is it even there? 

The whole thing is embarrassingly bad. It's like someone learned to build a bomb from Wile E Coyote; it's just so cartoonishly bad! And an ISIS pro-Trump sticker?! If it's supposed to explode, why bother?!

Why would *any* conservative, ""alt-right"", right winger, etc., *ever* waste a moment on this? These sorts of false flag attacks fit a very specific MO. Sadly, I think a bomb made by and ""alt-right conservative"" would have actually been functional, or at the least convincingly designed. They are, after all, a bunch of ""war crazed gun nuts"". I think they'd know their bombs. I could possibly see a sperged out channer doing it for lulz and making it purposely bad in an attempt to embarrass the media, further, but they wouldn't have been able to keep themselves from adding a Pepe or Kekistan flag or some shit. 

This is definitely not something an extreme leftist would do though. If a neo-liberal made this thing, it would have a little device that screamed ""RACIST NAZI SCUM!!"" at you before it exploded, kinda like those annoying birthday cards that sing you a song. I guess that version only goes to Trumps people though. My mistake.

Yeah, liberals are only known for yelling at people while they eat. 

Had someone told me back in 2004 that over the next decade and a half that I'd be defending conservatives, I would have laughed in your face and thought you were insane. The Democratic party has completely devoured itself, but at the same time, this has been in the works for decades.
They've been chipping away at censorship all while purporting to be the champions of free speech.

[Jello Biafra - Tipper Gore -Oprah show, 1990](https://youtu.be/IKRGX1a-JBE)

I think there are a lot of independent voters out there -many more than the extremes, who are sick of this shit. Once the ""consensus hacking"" of social networks is stopped and exposed, the tone of things will change drastically. People won't be afraid to speak up and force a conversation because they'll no longer feel outnumbered by manufactured consensus' and bot group think, shouting them down and calling them racist nazi Trump supporting alt-right terrorists simply because they have different views and a liberal isn't able to listen to them. Able, being the key word here. The programming has worked. "

"All well and good on the PC. On the ps4 we have one (fast) way to switch which is triangle. So if on the AR, button push once for pistol, twice for DBS, three times to 9mm, 4 times to get all the way around to AR again. Having just two weapons negates this awful problem as whichever weapon you are on you can just push or double tap to skip the 9mm.

 Where as I assume you guys just push 1, 2 or 3.

Not sure who is at fault here but the game will barely recognise 4 rapid button pushes and will most of the time get stuck on random weapon number x. We desperately need a way to put the 9mm up in the inventory like the welder.

Probably should have said before that I don't want to get braids/dreads. I want something that is somewhat similar to what I already have 
"I've already said Winston is our best QB ever, a solid fit, and the best option we have right now and it isn't his fault for the overall problems of the team so quit with the passive aggressive ""oh you don't like him huh."" ""I'd consider him just outside the top 20 at his best and the best of the aforementioned names"" you either didn't read that through, missed the point, or ignored it. I mean if you take apples to apples the best of each QB including Jameis (including Elis 2 SB's) he's just at 20 if not outside. Mayfield is looking better at the moment. Overall? No, but since you want to take age and surrounding players into account? Yeah, I do think Bortles, Mayfield, and Winston are in the same tier. Baker has Landry and Njoku. Bortles has a barren WR corps, an injured starting RB, and a defense that's slipping. Jameis has arguably one of the best receiving squads in the NFL (or at least the NFC) next to Eli and all of the problems we've talked about to death surrounding the team so I won't say it again. 

Could someone have Winston at the front of that tier and someone else at the back? Sure. I also said ""current-form Trubisky"" because he's on fire RIGHT NOW. It seems only the present is relevant to you since you're mentioning the older ages of the QB's and I can't tell if maybe you're insinuating only their current play in relation to his is relevant? Even so almost all of the 30+ guys I mentioned are better. 

Also, Foles kinda won a Super Bowl. Say it's a stacked team and etc all you want; I doubt our boy could've done that. Just look at the 2017 game vs the Pats.

Like I said in my original post and the one after; he's good but not great. He has massive needs for improvement and could do much better with the weapons he has. We can argue over individual players versus him all you want. 
Focusing on semantics and attempting to be snarky and muddle the point doesn't do anything; yet here we are. Even if the lost 4 aren't as good, he's 16th or 17th. Still just taking a small point and running it into the ground"

"The first thing to keep in mind is that these will be largely helped by the legalization of psychedelics (assuming you're in the U.S. or some average western country).

The idea of having some large psychedelic monastery has been done before (as demonstrated by the Hitchcock Mansion in the 60's, host to Timothy Leary and many others: https://timeline.com/drug-mansion-psychedelic-60s-5116867d5041)

The problem with that is it was likely too dependent/open, and thus was very vulnerable to local raids by authorities. 

It'd be relatively easy to buy/build some form of psyche-based monastery and maintain it with no hassle, so long as it was down-low.. though one must admit, even in rural counties the neighbors would probably eventually get nosy. A church exemption status would likely help with this (COSM, anyone?), but would still be at risk from no-knock warrants."
"I've written this before but here goes again. If you really need to send these as HTML emails you are in for a royal pain. I have put together thousands of email blast for clients. I really am well-versed in this at this point.

Years ago the powers that be at Microsoft decided that instead of using Internet Explorer to render emails, they would use the rendering engine from Microsoft word. So, it doesn't help to design an email and then look at it with various browsers. The HTML world of email is an absolute cluster fuck of cross compatibility and different renderings. Plus, more than 50% of emails nowadays days are opened on a mobile device so you've got to be responsive.

I would recommend you find a template from some of the millions of email templates out there and work with that. It will be built with tables and commented out div's. It may have a style sheet that will be done inline in the header and it will have a lot of in-line styles. Basically it will look like HTML from 10 years ago that went to hell.

You will be able to dynamically dump your content into this template. 

I usually tell clients that it isn't an option (cost prohibitive) but can see the appeal for them.  Keep it simple.

there was a thread earlier today about down the stretch defense streaming. a common strat people are talking about is combining two teams whose schedules sync up. Indy does have an easier schedule, though IIRC they dont have buffalo or AZ. I imagine if you go to that thread youll find someone talking about indy, and talking about good combos using teams that are probably free or will be dropped at some point.

The downside is you need two roster spots dedicated to defense to lock down this strat. but you already have 2? so maybe that works for u. that said, you should be able to find a 2 team defensive combo that wont require two roster spots. by that i mean, one of the teams has a spot where owners will probably drop them -- awful matchups or bye weeks. you can grab them then"

Are there any tips on how I can get stronger at benching as someone with this build? (Long legs, long arms, super short torso)"
"Ehhh double barrel isn’t quite the same. As someone that uses double pump in season 4 a lot there’s really no comparison. Yes it’s shooting shotguns in quick succession but... it’s really not a adequate replacement. Yes it can do a lot of damage but you have to have the thing almost shoved up their nose to do it. Season 4 double pump was the best of both worlds. Pump wasn’t too strong at long range, not too weak at close range, didn’t shoot too fast or too slow, had plenty of counter play. Idk. I like that they tried, and I think it’s a cool gun for sure, but as far as a double pump replacement goes I would rather have the season 4 pumps back. "

"&gt; Source?

Okay, [Here's 1](https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-bombings-grenade-attacks-violent-reality-undoing-peaceful-self-image-law-and-order/) and [here's another](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/06/30/confusion-over-immigration-and-crime-is-roiling-european-politics), and [here's one more for good measure](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45269764). You really have to be *trying* to deny reality to try to refute that. The debate that *could* be had is it for racist reasons or Swedens lack of preparedness for a mass influx of immigrants. The debate that *could* be had is whether or not muslims are inherintely more violent than swedes, OR if the lack of immigration services forces immigrants to more desperate and violent means of survival, regardless of ethnicity. 

What isn't a debate is whether or not Muslim immigrants are a source of violent crime in Sweden. That's unfortunately a fact. 

&gt; Are you saying that Muslim populations in the West commit crimes at precisely the same rate as the general population?

You had some odd word choices here, but let me reiterate. Violent crime in Sweden was/is directly correlated with the influx of Muslim immigrants. There was less violent crime before Muslim immigrants were allowed in, then they were allowed in, then violent crime rose."

"Generally no because poverty is generally cyclical and systematic while being a student is temporary. That doesn't mean you can't be a student and be in poverty but I would not say that all students are in poverty because they're technically below the poverty line. The poverty line generally does not apply to those not in the workforce though.

There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Housing and food security are serious issues for students because that's often the result of other factors such as family income/support and ability to get funding which is not equivalent to poverty. It's not zero sum. 


Alternative question, do you consider all students to be at least middle class? 

I say this as someone who came from below the poverty line."

I understand that he put you in a weird position by calling it a date when you guys would hang out,  and you agreed to date him initially because you didn't want to hurt his feelings, but like by doing that you most likely hurt his feelings a lot more than you would have if you had instead told him you didn't want to date him in the first place.

I think pretty much anyone would be really upset if someone they had a huge crush on agreed to date them knowing they didn't feel the same way and inevitably broke up with them because of it.

I'm, however, unsure about reelection prospects if we get a rate hike recession before 2020. I am concerned that switching R for D would be a problem longer term from both a policy and culture perspective.

I could also be convinced that R\* has dropped and that powell risks raising above this level unnecessarily. Fed policy is not a precise tool.

There's a lot of silly excess in capital markets that have been compounding since Bush 2. It'd be nice to have the tide go out on that and have markets that more properly allocate resources, but if I'm wrong about R\* then I'm wrong about the market not allocating well presently.

"Best suggestion I can give is to pick a bunch of ships you like, and then pay close attention to what each of your ships are good at and bad at.

For the most part, ignore the rarities. Each ship has their own strengths and weaknesses, which you will need to take into consideration depending on which sortie you do. Take a brief look at their stats and what kind of skills they have. Then if you fail a sortie, troubleshoot what went wrong, and adjust your fleet accordingly.

For example, let's say I want to use Takao, Portland and Indy in my front. My DPS against heavy armor is gonna be pretty damn good, but my fleet will be very slow. If I find myself having trouble dodging enemy torpedoes, I'll switch one of my heavy cruisers for a fast ship like Shiranui and it will usually solve the problem.

Another example is if you roll with Enterprise, Akagi, and Kaga. Your damage output will be very high, and you will easily survive most enemy aircrafts, but you may find yourself struggling against enemy BB artillery fire and torpedo boats at high level maps. Since you figured out what you're having trouble with, you just have to make a fix (for example, put Fusou as flagship and give her a fire extinguisher + CL secondary gun, and that will solve both the BB artillery fire and torpedo boat problems).

Your fleet will really depend on your situation. Knowing what each of your favorite ships are good at is the best thing you can do to build a good fleet."

 I was comparing to other pics from MoMs and other people, and the quality of what I bought seemed pretty brutal. Extremely dry and crumbly. The smell is really nice, definitely skunky, but also fruity. The pic from the post is after smoking about 1g of the smaller chunks between the two of us. We were listening to music and playing board games waiting for it to kick in.  After about 15 minutes we had a little more, since we weren't feeling much. At that point, I started to feel myself drifting back and forth between reality and a fuzzy state where my mind just kept racing between different things, almost drawing pictures in my head faster than I could think them. I had some more, and then it really kicked in.  I felt like if I moved my head forward and backwards, my neck was rubber and it felt like it was stretching out. Definitely a good feeling! My wife didn't feel much of anything unfortunately, maybe she didn't have enough.

We are both definitely going to keep trying it... We want to try vaping, edibles, etc.  We are even going to try growing some, I've already ordered some seeds from JahSeeds.

"For some reason, undocumented immigrants don't typically report themselves. So, there's no accurate way of counting them.

The closest we have to a number is the ~700,000 registered DACA recipients. Making some reasonable guesses (most have 2 adult parents, many are too young, etc) it comes to about 8 million, or about 2% of the US workforce.

www.migrationpolicy.org/data/unauthorized-immigrant-population/state/US has a slightly higher estimate at 11 million using an algorithm based on DACA and H1B data. Theirs is probably the better number."

"As someone that has used Medicare and private insurance, Medicare is far superior. Private insurance is awful for their customers should you have to utilize for a chronic condition. And it’s not the government making them play the games they do. It’s profit motive. Some things just aren’t well solved by the market. And there are many of systems in the world that do it better and the good ones all regulate their insurance to make it not suck. Germany has a great model with great outcomes. No reason we can do something like here except fear mongering."

"Yes, yes. And some people say it is meta-cognition. And some people say it is self-recognition. And some people say it is narrative comprehension. And some people say it is our native aptitude for cybernetic enhancement (in a broad sense). And so on and so forth.

The search for The Distinguishing Feature of Humans (TM) is foolhardy. We are part of the rest of the natural world and we should expect that our differences are matters of degree and not kind. The whole enterprise of trying to distinguish humans (based on possession of this or that attribute) is based on a religious idea that humans were created separately from the rest of the animal kingdom, and this search has suffered from the fallacy of begging the question, in the following way: every time it is proved that animals possess some proposed quality of human uniqueness, philosophers have moved to proposing some other criteria. In other words, we start from the presumption that humans are special, and then we keep inventing new ways to try to prove that presumption. This begs the question in favor of the uniqueness of humans. Really, we should admit the simple fact, that we are products of evolution, and contiguous with the rest of the animal kingdom - not apart from it."

Pirates of the Caribbean 6 (TBA)
Shortly before the release of On Stranger Tides, it was reported that Disney was planning to shoot the fifth and the sixth films back-to-back,[3] although it was later revealed that only the fifth film was in development. On March 4, 2017, director Joachim Rønning stated that Dead Men Tell No Tales was only the beginning of the final adventure, implying that it would not be the last film of the franchise and that a sixth film could be released.[4]

In September 2017, producer Jerry Bruckheimer indicated that another Pirates of the Caribbean sequel is still possible if Dead Men Tell No Tales does well in its home release.[5] In October 2017, Kaya Scodelario said that she was contracted to return for a sixth film.[6] Shortly after, it was announced that Joachim Rønning is being eyed to direct the film.[7]

The film is still in development, as of October 2018"

"I wouldn't use the word prioritize, but I would just say for a teenager connected to social media all the time, culture wars might be more front and center than say . . . student loans (high school is free) or healthcare (free /parents pay for it until you are 26).   When that shit actually hits you (just like taxes and schooling and all that hits you once you have kids) your understanding of these issues changes.

In the case of the MSD kids . . . gun violence literally hit them at a young age and became real.  But for most kids, it hasn't really hit them yet.  They *became* activists because of a life experience."
"Except this is not shown at all. We slaughtered scores of them in Wrath, and the Alliance’s only major interaction with the Val’kyr in Andorhal has us kill scores of them again with no impact on the Forsaken’s ability to raise fallen Alliance soldiers who are immediately loyal to Sylvanas with their “free will.”

Not to mention it has been previously stated that the val’kyr can only raise dead humans yet now they can somehow raise fallen Night Elves for no reason.

The only special thing about Sylvanas’ val’kyr is that they can sacrifice themselves to resurrect her and that kills them. The way they are depicted is anything but strong."

"I own a 2006 Ford Explorer V8 2WD. If you had linked the vehicle and it was close to me I would literally go buy it RIGHT NOW.  I've owned my current Explorer for about 6 years and bought it with 80k miles and it has 165k miles. Once I fixed all the stuff from the previous owners (they trashed it, things were broken that should have never been broken) it has been very reliable.

That motor and transmission are bulletproof. The 6 cylinder Explorers had a ton of problems but the 4.6 V8 and 6 speed transmission are unkillable.

For what they are, they handle well (independent suspension), good interior, pretty fast, and have tons of utility. 

The common issues on them are: 
1. Exhaust manifolds warp at about 80-100k miles and tend to warp again later. $750 repair

2. First spark plug change is expensive! You NEED to soak the plugs for a day or two in liquid wrench or they WILL snap in half when you remove them, making them have to be extracted. If nothing goes wrong it's a $200 job, if they all break it's like $500-600.

3. Wheel bearings go out at about 100-120k miles. Mine have lasted until 165k miles though so I am assuming they've been changed before I bought it with 80k miles.

4. Radiator also tends to crack (plastic) and needs to be replaced at some point.

MPG in town is like 13mpg, on a long trip going 70+ I get 23mpg. This is hand calculated. The 6 speed auto allows fantastic highway mpg (2k rpm at 75mph), and the in town mpg is awful. I average like 15-16mpg. I have a fairly heavy foot though. 

I've been looking for a new car but it's because mine had a rough life before I got it, plus at this point I just want something new. I've been looking for a car on and off for MONTHS (14 months?) and I honestly can say I haven't been able to find something that beats it for my personal needs. I love my Explorer. What usually stops me from buying a new car is the realization that I'd have to get rid of it.

This is usually more difficult in solo though, so trying to have decent awareness and communication is key.

"Salesforce is a great tool to know, and Salesforce is just really diving deeper (comparatively) into analytics.  Einstein Analytics within Salesforce, and the ability to pull data into Salesforce from other systems, manipulate the data, and produce powerful reports is a sought after skill set right now.  Getting the Admin 201 cert would be a good start for that.  To everyone telling you it's not possible to pass, don't listen.  I passed the admin exam (granted it was 7 years ago, and the system is more complex now) after knowing what Salesforce was for a month, no admin experience, and a little bit of studying.  

&amp;#x200B;

I would recommend starting here - [https://trailhead.salesforce.com/credentials/administrator](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/credentials/administrator)  and looking at the Prepare for Your Salesforce Administrator Credential trailmix listed.  It says 44 hrs to complete, but if you are familiar with IT systems, cloud based tools, or have a knack for technology learning, it shouldn't take that long.  There are also loads of practice tests out there [http://www.salesforceben.com/certified-admin-mock-exam/](http://www.salesforceben.com/certified-admin-mock-exam/) is a good one (may require a $10 lifetime membership) [justsalesforce.com](https://justsalesforce.com) I believe has some practice tests.

"""I'm just your every day, anywhere kinda' guy. Most days people don't even know I exist and, believe it or not, I'm fine with that. Those that do know me, however, always get to see my handiwork up close. Some people say I have a cherub like demeanor, and if it weren't for the male pattern baldness, they'd say I was pretty cute, but that's neither here nor there.
 
I would like to say I'm a man of many talents. It's seldom that my plans go awry, but if they do, I'll have you know, it wasn't my fault! Sometimes things happen for a reason, and then there are times like this, and I gotta' say... 
 
I shot myself in the foot on this one. 
 
Now I'll go ahead and spare you the minute details of what exactly it is that I do, but I do feel that I have a few things to get off my chest.

Oh well, I can't cry over spilled milk.
 
Now... Now we get to you, my dear. In all my years I've never had this happen. It's truly a first. I just can't have you following me around anymore! Frankly, it's embarrassing. At first it was cute, but if you keep this stuff up, I'm going to get fired. Another thing, don't keep rubbing up against me while I'm working. This stuff takes precision and I'm not about to have another incident on my record.
 
This was a mistake. You're great and all, but my magic just doesn't work on me. Plus, you're a little too young. This age gap is plainly too much, and I can't see it working out. So, I know this sounds heartless, but once my manager gets back to me, we'll get this thing cleared up. Ok...? We'll just go our separate ways. Any questions?""

Why do you keep making everything white this white that. I just gave you all the reason I find him interesting and why other do none of them are him being a white dude punching stuff. Perhaps you have some kind of agenda. I can't speak for Superman since I was never really into the character but he's definitely had some great stories and you could probably find out why people like him if you asked them instead of reducing an iconic character with decades of stories into a single sentence. Again there's a difference between you not finding something interesting and something not be interesting. If you don't like Daredevil fine but he is far from an uninteresting boring character. I've already explained why.

"I’d love to see more open maps like eternity and equinox in regular play. They are the best designed in my opinion, and provide a refreshing break from the endless shotguns on every other map. I personally feel that most supers are too tanky, and there’s really nothing that I can do to kill them before they kill me unless I have specific heavy weapons or I’m on a titan. Even with mobility exotics I struggle to run away from Nova Warp. That brings me to my next topic, Nova Warp is completely busted and is hands down better than every other subclass/super in PvP. This one fact is true no matter how many times I am downvoted. Titan skating and the tuning of certain exotics (One Eyed Mask and Ursa Furiosa) are also way above the norm in power level and should be brought down slightly. Heavy ammo should be a bit less frequent so it isn’t a game of win the first fight and snowball. Last but not least, Telesto is cancer and should not have the infinite range that it currently has.


There’s my honest opinion on PvP, please feel free to tell me your’s. I’m a pretty average player but I have managed to achieve a Luna’s Howl so I’m not complete trash.


Edit: Almost forgot, I can’t stand 6v6, especially on these current maps. 4v4 &amp; 3v3 are much better ways to experience Destiny PvP. 2v2 would be as well, but heavy shouldn’t have a place in it. The match is incredibly one sided once one team has control over it."

"You are amazing and your students are getting a great human being. 

You have struck a major cord with me. I am also a sub and I have a class that I’m called to that resembles the same chaotic feelings yet lovable students. 

I been noticing that when one kid is a behavioral problem I feel overwhelmed and focus on them and ignore that most students are listening and being awesome. 

I been subbing for 3 years so I’m fairly new. So I been developing some techniques of dealing with these wise guys. There’s this one boy that wants all the attention and likes to be the clown to the point where he even makes fun of himself. So when I’m being funny he piggy backs of the energy and pretty much kills it. Lol so at first I would ask him to go outside because I want to briefly talk to him. I made it sound like he’s not in trouble I just need to chat with him. Because when I’ve made it a punishment they won’t go outside lol so while their outside waiting I really feel in control because now all the students see that I don’t put up with that. So then when I chat with the student I make it personal. I say things like you’re disrespecting me and he’s better than that. And ask him if he can take it down a notch. I also once let him know that they are not laughing with him but at him. He seemed to understand and calm down. The next time I told him to go outside I wasn’t very assuring instead assertive. 

Another thing I do with that class that they absolutely love is that if I’m reading a story I choose characters and as I read it they re enact it. It can get a bit loud but i remind them that I will send them back and get a new student to play their part lol I also have to remind the students to keep their laughter to a minimum because it’s loud for the other classes surrounding us. I once had a teacher come in and ask us to quiet down. Lol 

One more thing I do is tell them funny stories of when I was their age or when I was young what I did and how I got in trouble. I try not too use stories that I would not mind them repeating because they will tell their parents and friends. One kid stopped me in the hall and reminded me of the story I told them once lol so yeah they will tell others. 

This week I had another 4th grade class that was extremely stressful and it took me a whole day to get over all the frustration I felt that day. So I totally relate to your feelings. 

One thing I did that you can tell bothered the behavioral kids for this class is that I rewarded the good students with free time on their laptops while the others read a book. Some asks why don’t they get time and it felt so good to let them know that these students earned and I got to ask them if they earned this privilege and got to remind them about their disrespectful behavior. They didn’t argue they knew lol

Hope you keep up the good work and know that your efforts are appreciated by many and it’s extremely difficult to tune out the bad apples. It’s a mindful exercise for myself as well.

I unironically think he's the most influential artist of the 21st Century, he's transcended musical genres and provided a level of quality that nobody would have expected the average Hip Hop artist to constantly keep at. I genuinely can't think of another artist that has managed to hold onto their fame and keep pushing out critically and commercially acclaimed albums like he has. "

"What I think you and others that require tests like this aren't taking into consideration is that you're creating an atmosphere where two (or maybe more) candidates who _know_ they are directly competing for a single spot have to create something better than the other candidate. You're essentially saying, ""I'm going to hire whoever will bend over backwards the hardest for me for free,"" and not, ""I want to hire the best designer I can for this role.""

Most of my background is in technical writing, and I'm friends with a number of designers, most of them pretty good. Do you know what the best among them have in common? They know what they're worth, and they won't work for free for any reason -- especially work that the potential employer can just steal from them anyway.

Nobody asks MBAs to provide the equivalent of a day's work ""as a test."" Nobody asks managers to run a team for a few hours to see how they do. Why in the world are creative fields any different?"
"Also keep in mind that levels are marginal, and you really shouldn't farm Avenue to Power after getting the daily rewards (compared to the ""loss"" of not farming Fortune). Daily rewards are plenty for investing in characters to prepare for the next event. 1200 EXP per fortune run definitely adds up over time, especially without co-op. And while you should be building a team of each element, it'll generally be one ""main"" unit that you control+use for co-op and a few ""filler"" units, so past level \~40-50 your effective returns are generally better if you focus on your main unit.

Once your characters are ""good enough,"" let them be and watch them level up through use. My light team members (except for my main) gained upwards of 10-15 levels from this event, going from the \~40s to the 3\* level cap of 60/mid-60s for the 4\*."

Thats the problem with the alliance story, according to power levels and past events, they *should* be wiping the floor the horde, the horde shouldnt even exist anymore. But that cant be allowed to happen so alliance has to be stopped just short of victory every time for no reason and 2 xpacs later the horde are gonna be back fucking up our shit again."

"SEAMUS IS WRONG ABOUT THE TOY BEING A VILLAIN AND IT REPRESENTING A TOY!!! Take a trip with me down Toy Story lane...

In Toy Story 2, Woody exclaims that he hasn't seen a record player ""in ages""

""AGES AGO"" many people with polio before the 1950s (and well after) were put into what was called the ""Iron Lung"" which was a full metal suit that used vacuums to compress and decompress the chest cavity, keeping patients alive (I think). 
The ""Iron Lung"" left only the patients head exposed.
Woody is quite obviously a toy from well before Andy's time considering Stinky Pete exclaimed that after Sputnik was launched, ""Woody's Roundup"" was canceled before its final episode because of the newfound interest in space toys. 

SPUTNIK LAUNCHED IN 1957

THE POLIO VACCINE WAS FIRST USED IN 1955.

The toy being referenced in the crib with Jack-Jack is covered in metal from his neck through his toes. 

ANDY'S DAD HAS HAD ZERO REFERENCE IN ANY TOY STORY MOVIE.

Woody continually states that the best thing a toy can do for their owner is to ""Always be there for them""

Here's where things get tricky... There's an obviously significant time gap between the late 50s and the time of Andy's insimination (roughly 1989)

The last case of polio was in 1979

The first case of frozen semen used for artificial insemination was in 1953

Here it is........ 

Andy's father was born before Sputnik, and his father bought him Woody to grow up with before he could even walk. Woody was ""always there for him"". Unfortunately, Andy's father contracted polio JUST before its inoculation became mandatory in 1961. Andy's mother fell in love with Andy's father despite his handicap, but before they could produce a child he was placed in an iron lung. Luckily enough, Andy's father had frozen sperm which Andy's  mother used to produce Andy. Andy's mother told Andy's father that she was pregnant with Andy. Andy's father knew his time was coming and he wouldn't see his the birth of his son. Before Andy's father died, he asked his favourite toy (Woody) to always be there for his son as he had always been there for him.

"remember when u/gremlech became prime minister of australia and then made relations with new zealand and australia so good that everyone remembered that they wanted to merge the two nations together. the queen was simply so impressed that upon meeting him she remembered that her first child was a bastard she dumped in australia and that u/gremlech was in fact directly in line to the throne. The british royalty were shocked until they remembered that one time u/gremlech single handedly recused them all from terrorists and stopped the nuclear bomb threat after he anonymously donated ten billion dollars to charity. They all unanimously agreed he should probably be king. then all the former colonies came to the conclusion that they wanted to be apart of uk again as well. Then the super giant uk joined the eu again, and given all the amazing things he'd done his life, curing diseases that definitely existed and being the second to none greatest chess player in the world that if the eu wanted to elect a big cheese, it should probably be the current king of the uk. 

The average citizen will have no idea who the fuck i am but every world leader will love me pretty unconditionally. anyone who stands against me will quickly remember that they are a martian sleeper agent trying to take over the world and the good in their heart will cause them to admit as much. As the big kahuna of planet earth, the big banks all remember how good communism was and make me the high ceo and then  china will probably remember that tumour in xi Jinping's brain and turn to me as the great cultural leader of china, remembering that time i defended the chinese government from total collapse at the hands of the serpent society. 

the remaining nations will soon give in to my oppressive economic power. i have no idea how to run a country though so my world order collapses into anarchy about a week after it begins. five thousand people all remember that time i sacrificed my self to save the world from a meteor as i go live on an island somewhere in the pacific where i'm revered as a god.

"A) So you don’t think it’s at all possible that this attempted bombing could have been carried out by terrorists with memory spans of more than a couple of years?  It absolutely has to have been a result of Trump decrying his political enemies, something that has apparently never been done before.

B) authorities do a little thing called “investigating.”  They don’t just jump to politically expedient conclusions.  They will release information they obtain, in all likelihood.  The media are not held to this standard, they can speculate all day without a shred of evidence and just insinuate that this is a Republican plot or whatever.

"Yes, definitely. It is very apparent that my female friends have [mostly] been “allowed” to express emotions, while my male friends struggle with it more. It is also apparent that my male friends have less fear of the world because they have LESS of a reason to worry about rape, assault, commentary, etc. 

I love all of my friends but to be completely honest, I connect better with my female friends. My male friends are fun and we occasionally talk about emotional things but for the most part, my female friends are the ones with the capacity to REALLY go deep in their emotions, which is how I build trust/safety. 

I would also say that my male friends seem to have less “care” in the world. They don’t worry as much, they don’t start as much (prolonged) drama, and they are more likely to speak their mind even if it is abrasive. 

ALL of this is due to the way that our society has conditioned males and females to be. It isn’t really that my female friends are more emotional; it’s that my male friends have been told to “be a man” and “not cry” and they were more likely to be humiliated for it as children. It isn’t that my female friends are more anxious/nervous; it’s that my male friends don’t have to worry as much about not getting a job, being extra careful on the streets at night, and presenting themselves in a certain way to be heard. It isn’t that my female friends aren’t “strong” enough to speak their mind/what they are really thinking; it’s that my male friends have been allowed to use their voice, they have been allowed to talk over women, and they have been taken more seriously when they talk.

"Ah, now these are more reasonable points. I can't say I really agree with this reasoning. ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence"", after all. You've got reasonable points though.

&gt;Atheists can't make negative claims, because negative claims aren't falsifiable only positive claims are. It is also kind of an oversimplification. There are tens of thousands of gods and millions of interpretations; is an atheist going to go over all of them?

Hey, all the theists would have to do that as well, for all the other interpretations from theirs, right? ;)

Not really. There's no ""need"" to go over any of them. Which is more reasonable to believe? I would say atheism, for the reasons you provide - it's why I'm an atheist myself. I see no reason for me to believe in a god, so I won't. However, this also doesn't mean that I think anyone believing in a god is objectively wrong.

&gt;You can still provide evidence of God's existence though. It just needs to be compelling and sensical.

Yeah, that's a funny one. There's no ""evidence"" for atheism. There's plenty of ""evidence"" for theism. Can't say I've seen anything very compelling or sensical. Lots of uncompelling or nonsensical evidence. The stance of ""nothing's out there"" is harder to prove, but also doesn't really demand any justification here, does it?

As far as who needs to prove what, nobody really needs to prove anything. I can believe there's no god. A theist can believe there is a god. If I want to convince a theist there isn't one, they are right to expect me to provide proof. And if they want to convince me, I'll expect proof from them."

My entire claim states that this dichotomy doesn't exist. That's what this discussion is all about. So to compare one to the other doesn't logically compute with my argument. I am saying that ""homosexuality"" is a fetish, and there's no such thing as sexual orientation. So how can you claim that I'm a hypocrite for legitimizing one sexual orientation and not the other when I don't even recognize sexual orientation as a thing? It shows that you're not listening to me so why should I listen to you?"

I have intrusive thoughts about my jaw becoming unhinged, or somehow getting stuck. Every time I opened my mouth or ate I felt like my teeth were in the wrong places or were going to get stuck somehow. I would have to check every few minutes to make sure my jaw would open and shut and wasn't stuck. I had this super super intense urge to just open my mouth as far as I could just to make sure it would work. It doesn't bother me as much anymore, but now I am obsessive about my skin. I feel like I have little threads or fibers or something inside my pores from wherever my clothes rub against me. I waste soooo much time try to excoriate all my pores. I have gross scars from it that I always repick when they heal. Whenever I see any bump on my skin my brain thinks that I can just magically scrape it off. I have pretty bad carpel tunnel from this. When i have bleeding patches everywhere it makes me just want to stay inside and i end up cancelling plans. When I was younger and i had worse self esteem i would lie to my parents and tell them i was sick to stay home from school when i was embarassed of my skin.

"It's hard to say for sure what your issue is. Drop knees can be useful, sometimes, heel hooks, or really any trick from the bag that'll keep you as close to the wall as possible.

I'd guess it's more likely a strength issue. Core is really important on steeper terrain, and it's unlikely that you've developed it sufficiently climbing on other walls. The more your butt sags, the harder holding steady on a roof is. Climbing more steep terrain will certainly improve it over time, but you can do some exercises which will improve it also. I'd do them at the end of your session, every session.

I like anything that works my back, core, and shoulders while hanging from a bar. Toe touches, toe-to-bars, ice cream makers, front lever progressions, windshield wipers, etc. Planking is useful also, but I use it as a cooldown exercise after my other sets, and often times modify it to make it harder."

Politicians aren't supposed to do what is best for the members of the political party they are supported by, they do what is best for all their constituents as they see it, influenced by an ideology that their supporting party shares.

Political parties are a way for people with shared views to coordinate on electing a representative that shares those views. That is equally valid on the state level as it is the national level."

"I'll tell you more about my prison dreams in private; but the first dream I remember after ending up in jail was of my wife and I flying or floating on rails in a gondola/rollercoaster type contraption above an utterly ruined world. I remember the sky was a sickly yellow color and the material of the world was comprised almost entirely of twisted metal girders that were rusted out to brick and brown hues. I just remember the nauseating feeling that was realizing we were stuck on this ride and all we were ever going to see was the devastation mankind had wrought upon the Earth for the rest of our lives, circling and looping through a pale, piss colored sky.

Then I woke up, staring at the chipped grey paint of the metal bunk frame above me, and immediately took a piss in the stainless steel toilet bowl that was roughly two feet from where I laid my head to sleep."

"I'm not saying that, I don't want to assume anything as I would be guilty of the same thing I condemned the OP for doing.  I think we should all be aware those on the left and on the right that there are all manner of parties and political groups that make no claim to be anywhere near the centre.  I don't want to speculate but there are forces at work that don't care about the structure of society, they would be happy to see it crumble under the illusion that something better will rise from the ashes.  I'm not saying that this is what is happened, but we should be aware that there are some that don't and will not play by the rules of this political game. 

The April mob was not making headlines in the same way this is.  I can't recall there being any threat made to Honduras to stop them from coming. I can't recall Mexico doing anything to try and stop it.  And I don't see Trump letting this caravan in.  He can't say protect the border and at the same time allow thousands to walk in which appears to be what is going to happen.  It's almost too perfect.  What political or social tragedy has happened to spark this movement of people, out in the open, not trying to sneak into the US.  What has happened? I'm highly skeptical of it all and the timing is just too perfect.  

It tells us our poorer neighbouring countries do not respect the United States and will not listen to its leaders. It also shows they don't care for the welfare of their own countries to stay and fight for them.  We need to keep these people where they are, and help them where they are. "

"&gt;The rest are just normal young adults who happen to like a kids show.

This is what you initially responded to. /u/Samcraft1999 made an exception of one friend who was a deviant, and made clear that they didn't believe these others were.

&gt;Define normal? To each is their own but my definition of normal doesn't include grown men watching ponies run around on adventures and talk in cutsie baby voices.

You contest Samcraft, suspecting that ""the rest"" **can't** be normal if they watch My Little Pony. Your following sentence, rather than clarifying anything, instead seems to imply there **must** be some kind of other, more deviant reason to explain being a fan of Pony. This idea is what the first half of my response was directed towards: the main characters are adults, so there are no ""cutsie baby voices.""

&gt;Right, but we are still talking about my little pony here. Not star trek or comics.

This is true.

&gt; We are literally talking about grown men wanting to fuck ponies.

This is not quite as true. Sam certainly wasn't, and /u/Kizovad before him was steering away from that topic. You're the one who brought it back there with your ""clarification.""

I clarify my own point on the topic, I wasn't quite as much defending people wanting to ""fuck ponies,"" but rather pointing out that for any thing, you'll find someone who would like to fuck it. Though, having looked back through the comment chain, I admit that it was a mistake of me to follow up on the topic.

I will instead end off by reaffirming that My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a legitimately decent show, and a person doesn't need any sort of deviant reason to enjoy it."

"&gt;LOL... You are daft. The HMDs you are talking about have complete subsystems in them that handle taking the HDMI video and driving the displays. That is extra electronics that you are completely ignoring (and expecting to be doubled on the Quest since it exists in the SOC support systems but cannot be used for an external connector.) It does not have to reinvented, but it would have added to the Quest, increasing the heat and power load. It is not ""just a switch"".

**It would be just a switch** between the SoC, and the electronics needed to drive the display, this is fucking obvious. Do you really need me to explain everything to you before you call me out on ""omitting"" every detail?

These electronics are in *every PC HMD* in production. But you seem to think that adding them to do Quest would double the R&amp;D of the project. (you can't really believe this, can you?)

Like I've told your numb brain numerous times: **this would be trivial to add from an engeenering standpoint, but it would add cost**. And it would also inevitably add some weight.

I'm not even ""grilling"" Oculus over omiting them, all I said that is that it would've been nice to have. But that most people wouldn't use it anyway.

"So based on everyone's ideas it looks like it comes down to Wullfwaroo, Norra, or Heff as my second bumper.  I don't think I can afford a third bump and still have enough firepower to actually bring down the targets.

Wullfwaroo (67 *As listed above*): 4-5 die primary with a 180 degree arc.  Small ship so it doesn't move as fast or bump as large of an area.  Full set of speed 2 and 3 non-red maneuvers but most are white.

Norra (65 *Intimidate, Tail Gunner, Zeb, Scrambler*): Tactical scrambler to obstruct, shots out of both front and back throwing one less die.  Medium size and more survivable due to pilot ability.  Has a K-Turn but red 3-turn and 4-straight.

Heff (53 *Intimidate, Zeb, Tactical Officer, Scrambler, Pivot*): Tactical scrambler and two agility.  Coordinate could prove useful.  No 3-turns but blue 2-banks unlike the Auzituck.  Much cheaper and would allow putting a torpedo, R3, and a shield on Wedge."

"It's getting pretty late here so I'll just copy paste what I wrote to another user.

""As I wrote, my point is that many people see breed characteristics as a guarantee that the dog will behave according to those. It isn't. I can't tell you how many times i've had conversations with well meaning people who come in with their dog because of ""behavioral problems"" that could be solved if they invested the time it takes. The problem is that most people don't have a lot of time, so they search for ""calm"" breeds who doesn't require a lot of training. I explain to them that by far most dogs don't require a lot of training unless you want them to do specific tasks, but they should not be surprised if the dog doesn't turn out exactly as they wanted. I often have to convince families with small children that there is no such thing as a breed that wont be aggressive towards their child if it's provoked. No matter what breed you choose bringing in a dog to a family with small children is a risk they should be aware of, and that they under no circumstances ever should let their child be alone with the dog no matter how fond they are of each other. A lot of people have a very romanticized perception of dogs so they don't think about that in essence they are bringing an animal into their home. There is no guarantees.""

"You. Because you said you wanna sell one of the two wingers at our club to bring in more money for a centre back. That implies that we aren't buying another winger because otherwise the Nelson money wouldn't even be talked about in the context of a centre back.


I was trying to be nice but seriously if you can't see why selling Nelson for 30m when he's 18 instead of seeing if he can grow into a better player then we can see why the club doesn't give fans control of the financials.

Like if you were in the housing market you would sell a house that could rise to 3 times the value to buy something which has its market valued already settled (a 60m cb). That is ridiculous. Nelson won't go down from 30m by any considerable amount literally unless he gets a horrible injury. If we sell him in three years even if he doesn't hit his potential he will still be a 21 year old with a shit tonne of natural talent. Definitely someone our rivals could use and would want (and he'd still have 2 years on his contract). Like I said even if he's shit he will not drop below 20m. 

You know ox? He was like 24 and was a youth talent who never really got better. 40m pounds including add ons. Actually fucking think about what you'd be throwing away for a short term cash injection.

"From your old account to your new account. (Obviously, you will need to create a new account first--- I would recommend Gmail).

Google ""how do I forward mail from my X account to my new Y account,"" and you will find step-by-step instructions almost immediately, often with pictures.

Depending on what kind of account you have and what kind of forwarding you set up, the only other thing you might then need to do is open up your old account once a month and delete everything to make sure that your inbox doesn't fill up. It should take thirty seconds, since you'll just need to delete, not read. Just pick something else you need to do once a month (like pay the electric bill) and do both at the same time. And then, if you're female, give yourself a self-exam, because you should be doing that once a month, too."

We had some good laughs, one to the point I thought I was gonna pass out. 

My husband works out of town so I’m going to see him this weekend. He’s been coming home since he started this new job but I have a weekend to myself and he’s off so it works out perfectly for me to go up there. It’s only 2.5 hours away. My stepdaughter has plans the whole weekend so it’s working out perfectly for us to celebrate our anniversary just the two of us. I’m looking forward to such a good weekend with my husband. We need it.

"Biggest issue with this historically, at least from what I know of the Burned furs and the related revivals, is how ""revolutionary"" this goal is.

I say revolutionary in the social movement sense, because like those upheavals in Russia, France, the USA etc these movements rely on conflict.

Once we get rid of the ""undesirables"", 'revolutionaries' run out of targets, so we start to invent new ones. Eventually everyone is a target and there is not enough people left to carry on the purge, and the whole system collapses. This is why the Burned Furs never got anywhere.

**If we want this to succeed, we have to agree on a** ***closed*** **set of targets. We need to make a short list of who or what we want out, and** ***stick to it.***  **We need a ""furry dogma"".**

"As an independent millenial, I'm very excited to vote democrat next month because I loathe the way Trump carries himself as president and because he's ignoring global warming since he won't be there when the bill comes due, but is it sort of selfish of me to want the markets to drastically plummet as well if the democrats win so that I can launch a portfolio while investments are on sale? The more I think about it the less and less selfish I feel, given that we're basically fiscal slaves to older generations at these prices. Even though I think the dems are way too soft on immigration, there is too much at stake for younger generations in this election and I really hope we get out and vote democrat in a big way. I'm not too optimistic though given that most of my friends are more worried about how many likes they get on their instagram pictures than anything going on in politics or the world in general."

Although this post is weird even for him, maybe he's starting to feel the heat and trying to get more gullible supporters(like riftalicious) who will believe his ""oh people just don't like me because of my different opinion, I'm a nice, civil person"" act.

Seriously though, it's supposed to be a book close, come full circle type of thing. The story starts with Kion assembling the team and them bickering with each other over their titles, and it ends the same way, showing that despite everything that happened and everything that changed, the most important things remained the same.

In my original draft, Kion actually ended up as more of a villain protagonist/ anti-hero, since people liked that aspect so much about Scar. The opening scene of the first chapter was alluding to that possibility, but in the end, he just has too many friends and good people around him for that to work.

In a way, Kion is actually the inverse of Naruto from NTBS. He is everything Naruto desperately wants to be: Respected, acknowledged for his talents, surrounded by friends and family who he can trust with his life. Naruto is defined by everything he is \*not\*, and the most heroic part of him is that he still chooses to do (what he thinks is) the right thing to do despite all of that. And that's why Kion could not be a villain, even though he kind of has that arrogant prince side to him: If he went evil despite having everything that Naruto ever wanted, he wouldn't be like Scar, he'd just be a brat.

And that's why the final chapter ends with Ono joking that they'll have to fight him too when it seems like all the power is getting to his head, and why it ends with the team joking around instead."

I remember when I lived in the state in ‘92, civil rights activists were pushing to update the voting system because it was riddled with holes that could, and were, used to change votes. That system was eventually replaced with the current, now outdated, digital voting machines but the tricks and loopholes remained to ensure election outcomes could still be controlled. 

Rigging elections is how the white power structure maintains its hold on the levers of government in Georgia and elsewhere...if they really held fair elections, there would be many, many more black governors, senators, and representatives in the State’s history."

I do not suspect that caterpillars are ever “conscious” of themselves or why they go about doing what they do.

Everything  that they do is driven by a DNA blueprint acquired over millions of  years of evolution. And it is this blueprint that determines, how, when  and what they do thru out their entire lifespan.

The caterpillar or the butterfly/moth never considers the why of it.

"&gt;In general, the republican brand seems to be more ready to justify their “conservative” (to not say homophobic/xenophobic) views through religious lenses. 

That's a fair point, but understand that neither side is without guilt. The discussion I often have is based upon the word ""tolerance"". People want us, the right leaners, to tolerate their views and beliefs. A lot of us do. However, when I ask them to do the same of mine, I'm a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic...etc. Here are a couple examples that have caused me issue:

I personally don't believe in abortion. I believe it's terminating a life. However, I am fairly aware that if Rowe v Wade were overturned, it would cause plethora health issues for women that would still seek it out, but would then find themselves in the hands of someone to perform the procedure for a hefty profit under possibly poor conditions. It would also likely cause child abandonment rates to rise, which would grind on our already overworked social services system. So, while I personally don't believe in it, I understand that more good can come from it. I think I was a misogynist nazi pig for stating that...not sure what her words were, because I don't listen after that. 

I also don't entirely believe we're doing as much harm to our planet as we say. I don't believe we aren't harming our planet either. My stance is that I don't know, and don't believe we have the evidence to convict nor acquit. However, do I believe in finding clean, renewable energy? Fuck yes! Do I want to see us recycle better and take care of our environment? Please! Do I want to see us reduce our dependence on critical resources? Absolutely! I don't want it because I think we're burning the planet down. I want it because that part just makes sense. I've actually been called racist for making that point. Don't ask me how, because it makes no sense to me. 

So, TL;DR, why can't we accept our differing views and discuss them rationally? Who knows? The next time I talk about climate change, someone might change my mind. The word ""tolerance"", however, makes all of my sphincters quiver, because those that use it as their buzzword to trample on my logical (attempted, anyway) arguments don't even follow it themselves.

"Educate, then invest. Google, read the FAQ here, and spend a few dollars on an investing book. The market will fluctuate. If you have a low risk tolerance, and panic when your investment drops $200, consider a lower risk investment, like a bond fund. "
"Ok. Now we’re making some progress. I’d agree that education on “how irrational it is to fear terrorism” leads to less effective terrorism. Earlier in the discussion though, I (maybe mistakenly) did not get the impression that you were discussing education on the irrationality of fearing terrorism... It sounded to me like you were discussing emphasizing the threat. That is literally the exact opposite of “emphasizing how it’s irrational to fear terrorism.” Maybe that mistake in understanding is on me. I’ll own it if so. 

But we both agree that...

1) Right wing terrorism, statistically, is not an existential threat to the US.

2) Promoting or putting emphasis on the material threat posed by it can lead to more fear than is rational. Thus harming efforts to confront the ideology.

3) A better use of effort would be in, as you put it... “educating people on how it’s irrational to fear terrorism” so terrorism becomes less effective. 

Correct?"
Just because all these resources exist doesn't mean there's the time and manpower to actually make use of all those resources.  It's the same reason not every possible forensic test is done on every piece of evidence for every criminal investigation.  It's not logistically feasible.

There's a few years gap in my treatment where I was medicated but not properly. Then a different pdoc after I moved jumped straight to abilify. I was really put off by that. The antipsychotic label was scary to me. Well, now lots and lots of drugs later I'm on lamictal, wellbutrin, seroquel xr. Latuda is in view but it's complicated. I love latuda.

"I think it’s bullshit how the people up top run their employees into the ground. However, I think it’s bullshit in all industries where this happens. Which is all industries. The only way to fix it is with your wallets. I thought it would be nice to have an indicator on a game that shows if employees were overworked. Like the staff rates it and it’s put on the box. So if people that worked on the game rate it a 2 out of 10 experience, you know it was fucking terrible to work there to make the game. Then people could decide which games to avoid. But that will never happen, because the system is set up to be as opaque as possible and doing anything that might benefit labor is seen as communism. 

But here’s the thing. No one cares when workers are exploited as long as it saves them money. Walmart, Amazon, video games. It’s everywhere and everyone just pretends to care. Or they care, but just care more about saving money. And the people up top could pay their employees adequately and still keep costs low, but that’s not how capitalism works. You take as much as you can when you’re at the top and only leave enough at the bottom so the whole thing doesn’t collapse under you. "

You mentioned that the nurse is discussing your daughter’s condition with others on staff. Only those who immediately care for your daughter should be informed about her condition. It is absolutely out of line for the nurse to gossip about your daughter’s health condition or to assume responsibility for making medical decisions that go against the doctor’s treatment plan for your daughter. You shouldn’t be feeling driven from the school over serious professional errors this nurse is making. Your daughter may not be the only student in this situation where this nurse is going far outside her boundaries. Keep advocating for your daughter’s care. You’re doing the right thing. "

"&gt; What can I use it for?

Scripting little system utilities, writing games, backend for a website, natural language processing research, scraping data from webpages...it's a practical language for a tremendous number of different uses.

&gt; How can I learn it properly?

There are a lot of beignner tutorials, some free online [coursework](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/) (like MIT's Open Course Ware). There are books like Learn Python the Hard Way (you'd want to go for the Python 3 version, not Python 2). Back in the day, I learned some basic programming on my own, but being forced to do coursework was one of the gamechangers for me. So whichever way you go, I think it's best if you can find exercises to do, and some way to get your answers evaluated by someone more experienced.

&gt; What are some tricks to make it easier?

Practice. Practice, practice, practice. Especially if something seems hard, that's something to double down on, until you really get it. 

Python has a standard style to it (some examples [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/), the full style guide [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Using the style guide as, well, a guide, should help other developers to help you out. Maintaining a familiar style makes code easier to read."

"You should know that the origin point of bullets, grenades, etc isn't the center of your screen (i.e. the player's eyeballs) instead, it is from the gun for bullets, and your right hand for grenades.

This is noticeable when you are aiming down your sights over a small wall, yet you still end up shooting the wall. Because the sights are a few inches higher than the barrel.

in terms of throwing grenades through a window, make sure you aim a bit to the left of the center of the window opening, this also depends on how far back you are from the window. I always aim for the leftmost side of windows and it works."

"Trump has absolutely had an impact in this, I'm not denying that. But domestic terrorism has been predominantly right wing since the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995 (which coincides with the rise in right wing militia movements). This isn't a situation where Trump is to blame for creating it, but he's almost certainly symptomatic of the issue.

I don't say that to defend Trump, but to emphasize that Trump isn't so much causal as he is correlated with it. His election, and subsequent speech, have emboldened people like this, but they existed without him, and may even have taken the same actions if he hadn't been elected.

If we want an answer to why these things happen, it isn't ""Trump"". Its roots go far deeper than Trump, and are even more complicated than ""Republican politicians"". Just like the left wing and anarchist terrorism I mentioned above, the causes of right wing terrorism is complicated, and can't really be pinned on any one thing.

We need to be careful about oversimplifying these things, or we'll never be able to understand them. If we're never able to understand them, we'll continue to be unable to fight back efficiently. It's only to our advantage to learn more."

"Mistakes like this generally show the group is not interested in a super serious, super hardcore consequences game.

To me, I think if you try heavy consequences then it'll be out of left field, they'll get tense and unhappy with play and likely the campaign will peter out shortly after from people not being able to play.

Players often screw up badly (because they are not trained operatives in real life - real operatives/spies actually get quite a lot of training on stuff like this)- it's not a reason to start a campaign with incredibly heavy consequences right at the start."

Moral of the story: Drink coffee before touching your phone or pick slippery phone cases so you can put your phone on your mom's car, have it fall off as soon as the car moves, and not lose a $700+ phone.

"Even cheap guitars require a lot of handcrafting. The 1959 Les Paul is considered by many to be perfection of the model after seven years of experimentation and major changes, and only about 1600 were produced. A 1958 or a 1960 will also fetch a ton of money, but the 1959 is the peak.

Even with modern technology handling some more tedious parts of the process (like buffing) or being better than a human could do (like fret leveling), a high-end guitar is still made mostly by hand.

Some brands cash in on legacy. Martin and Gibson are both more than 100 years old and have produced some of the finest instruments in the industry and have price tags that reflect that. Those two, along with Fender, are responsible for most of the advancements in guitar “technology” and most other brands are making instruments based on those designs."

"2560x1080... the 1080 means you have 1,080 pixels down the screen, vertically. And 2,560 pixels across the screen, horizontal. 

1080 x 2 = 2160.

4k is 3840x2160.

PS4PRO outputs 2160 picture **IF** it detects that it is attached to 4k screen/monitor.  **HOWEVER**, if it is not connected to 4k device, it outputs 1080 picture. Yes, 1080... doesn't matter that you are supersampling at 1440p.. it is *outputting* **1080**.

&gt; I played a supersampled 1440p spiderman on the ultrawide and it looked really lacking in clarity. 

Yep... because the console doesn't find a 4k device, it puts out a 1080 signal. That 1080 is then 'stretched' to fill 1440 ultrawide -- which results in a loss of clarity.

&gt; I then hooked it up to my £80 1920x1080 screen and it looked literally MILES better.

Don't be afraid of being dumb.  When you get to college, it's time to be done with caring what other people think of you, and be done with trying to look like you've got your act together.   Any time you don't understand what's being covered in class, ask a question.  Go to the professor's office hours or their TA's office hours or both.  Join or start study groups.  Read your reading assignments instead of going to parties.  Work your butt off.  Get to know your advisor and get their advice on what courses to take.  Always show up to class on time and alert.  Take good notes and review them periodically. 

If you do these things, your will learn physics better than anyone who had a good high school physics course."

That being said. Regardless of her hair color, tone of voice or complaints she’s entitled to her opinion. Everyone’s college experience is different. And from the tone of your post you don’t seem to be very open minded to girls with blue hair or snowflakes as you put it. A word of advice is that if you want to have an enjoyable time at college learn to be more open minded and more respectful of others. And if you take issue with that then I’d say go to RPI so you become their issue and not ours. "

"&lt;while waiting for a transport from Mos Eisley to Theed to sell some droids, Oct 2003, actual chat transcript I still have on my hard drive, cleaned up of course, slight embellishment of the logs for easier reading on Reddit&gt;

*[hic] Hey man, what do you do?*

IRL?

*Nah...*

I build droids, live on a moisture farm just outside of Anchorhead, and drink way too much at the Eisley Cantina and get into fights with the locals. Just picked a fight with the wrong Twilek, she was tougher than she looked!

(Translated: I was an old Master Droid Engineer, had a small house surrounded by moisture vaporators made by an in-game friend (also had mineral and chemical extractors as well as a few factories), was a Master Teras Kasi Artist (unarmed martial arts) and would role play getting drunk in the cantina and duel other players for fun. Also had I think xx41 Merchant so I could place vendors to sell my droids).

**Turrax rolls around on the floor laughing at you**

**Need a hand getting up?** (when you typed rofl into chat, you'd animate falling onto the floor laughing, was one of perhaps a hundred animated emotes)

*[hic] That's funny man...*

What about you?

*Oh man, I'm always drunk [hic]*

*I cobble together armour sets for anyone who wants it ya know*

(He was a Master Armorsmith, Master Rifleman, and as much medic/doctor as his points would allow at the time. This was before anyone really understood what the holo grind was and everyone was actually playing their own role. He'd play every day /drunk and was a fucking hoot, I digress).

Wanna come see my workshop? It's on Naboo...

*[hic] Maybe later? I'm just off to Lok to meet my guildies, we're hunting Kimos, need some scales for some armour*

Yeah sweet man, lemme just go put some shit on the Theed bazaar and I'll come find ya's.

**You and Turrax are now friends**

And that's how, waiting for a transport in a bloody video game, turned into an out of game friendship, that, although we've never met, has persisted for 15 years. He's a software engineer from the UK and very talented, and has given me 4-5 years of advice culminating in my own software development career.

You cannot ever over emphasise how great Star Wars Galaxies was for the social impact it had on players. The fact that there were no in game NPC vendors selling products, and that everything in-game was made by players made it the single best example of an inter dependent economy in the history of gaming. You couldn't effectively heal yourself so had to visit a doctor in a hospital (a player), and you accumulated battle fatigue in combat which meant that your effectiveness, and healing on you was progressively less effective, meant that you needed to go to a cantina and /watch and /listen to the entertainers, having conversations with you guessed it, other players, giving them tips, having duels, making friends, making enemies.

That's what made it great. No one cared that it was Star Wars, I mean, the environment was great because of it, but you barely ever saw a recognisable character in the early days. The catch phrase was about living the greatest saga, yours! And it was true. The sandbox freedom was phenomenal. **This is why I have massively high hopes for Star Citizen**, because I truly believe that Chris Roberts is channeling this same sort of experience, perhaps unknowingly.

It's just such a pity that Sony Online Entertainment saw the behemoth that was WOW, and decided they must have a piece of the pie, destroying the game in the process.

But, it does live on, within the [SWG Emulator](https://www.swgemu.com/), though without those friends still playing and without new blood, it's not quite the same. The memories persist though..."

Lenk and colburn decide to do it...because colburns still embarrassed about not writing a report from ten years back.  That his motive.  

Scott and bobby plant bones in bobby's own burn barrel where bobby lives.  He trying to frame himself?

Steve just has bad luck....that he has a big fire that night that went on for hours unknown to him bobby and Scott have planted Teresa's bones.  

Was just bad luck that he had a bleeding finger at that precise time also.  That coincides with blood in Teresa's car that's been planted by bobby picking up blood from his sink with a pipette he carries around?

And had no alibi other than sitting by that fire and cleaning up the garage. 

Steve's own actions even point to his guilt.

"I'm not sure if this is a real post, or not, but I will bite.  Autism and CPTSD do not cause mental lapses like the one you described, and ""psychosis"" is not a mental illness in and of itself, but rather is a temporary state (like a fever) that results from another more serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar.  Assuming this is real and you DID experience psychosis, then you should know it is only temporary--it passes--while gender dysphoria is a more permanent condition that has nothing to do with your grasp on reality.  Trans people are not delusional, they are not speaking in tongue or hearing voices like a person experiencing psychosis would; and if you told your p-doc that you were a different gender it would not get you out of the hospital because a person experiencing psychosis is incapable of being reasonable for prolonged periods, so you would definitely give yourself away at some point.

Your description of people faking mental illness sounds like one of Rush Limbough's bad opioid trips: completely fictional but enough to make him sweat and go red in the face.  These people simply don't exist, and society doesn't reward them for faking it.  If your life is improved by faking a stigmatizing mental illness then you have far greater problems and probably actually DO need meds and therapy.

Vote red if you want, but republicans are slashing medicaid and attempting to put an end to any and all social programs designed to help you precisely because of a specious argument about ""fakers"" and ""abusers"" like the one you are making.  Sadly, if there are any fakers in the program they will just move on to the next scam, but you, you will lose out irrevocably.  Unmedicated sufferers of mental illness often end up in prison or on the street, so think twice before you shoot yourself in the foot like that."

"The UC outsources some 'labor'. This includes, currently and in the past, anything from construction, to food service, to office work. This is accomplished via companies which operate as contracting entities (unions fill a similar function). The 'outsourced labor' is performed by employees of these contracting entities. These companies are generally for-profit and do not employ unionized workers, and as a result the UC is able to save a significant amount of money by using their contracting services (employees) instead of unionized workers. Obviously, the union doesn't like this, because it hurts their membership (and hence their revenue, as their members pay dues). In reality it has little to nothing to do with the union workers themselves, because the UC *is not* going to pay workers overtime (as current workers would have to be given more hours to perform the labor) if it can avoid doing so. It would rather hire additional unionized workers than pay the overtime.

An example of outsourcing would be the current temporary workers at the medical centers stepping in in place of the ones who are on strike. The majority of them are contracted in through contracting entities (in this case at least some of them seem to be other clinics / hospitals).

&gt;!Contrary to what the union and its supporters would have you believe, that saved money does not go immediately into the pockets of Janet Napolitano!&lt;

The term outsourcing here is used in an intentionally confusing way, because it generally has negative connotations from its use in politics (outsourced labor to China, Bangladesh, etc). The usage is an attempt to smear the UC with that connotation. As far as I could find, the UC is not outsourcing any labor to foreign countries.

&amp;#x200B;

The union does claim, however, that the UC is effectively an ICE collaborator, if you cared to know. This is because around 10% of their spending on contracting (between 2010 and 2011) has gone to contractors ""who are known to be ICE collaborators"". The union offers no substantiation for this claim however; not even a news article, and additionally leaves it unclear as to whether those contracting entities were collaborators before or after 2011."

"I tentatively disagree. I think there's a line between healthy vigilance and having anxiety ruin your life. My first lovebird lived 18 years with me, and my 3 deceased budgies all lived 12-13 years.

But I've also had anxiety disorders all my life. When I got insurance and treatment that worked for my anxiety, I worried less about the far-out chances of something weird and awful happening to my birdies, and I was more able to stop my worrying when I went over the steps I'd taken to make my babies safe.

"I had a relatively challenging program here, but I don't think that doing it elsewhere would have made it much easier.  If anything I felt that the standard here might have been slightly less rigorous, when comparing exams from other schools or from past decades.  

Obviously this will vary between programs, and I'm probably especially biased since ChemE is rather demanding wherever you go, but I feel like a lot of it is just the transition from high school to postsecondary and the requisite responsibility and self-discipline that demands, rather than anything unique to McGill itself.

"With or without side stepping Goten is still OP, he has a shit ton of buffs compared to any other unit (strike based) for free. Other characters can get rolling (like bardock) but need to kill or use abilities.

Goten has 40% PERMANENT buff JUST for being with trunks (and ofc you'd take trunks to a hybrid team, there's 3 of them, all decent enough to play). 40% is way too much considering his already huge base stat on strike attack. Not to mention the extra 20% when battle starts and other buffs from his Kamekameha and his Green card and the fact he has more stats than most other heroes for literally no reason (at least no reason to have more than his ""brother"" kid trunks).

Then again, when you see that Janemba and Gogeta have +/- 335k power at lvl 3... It's just whatever, powercreep is way too hard in this game. I've seriously though of uninstalling JUST because of this, I could handle a bit stale content even though it sucks if the game had variety in PvP. Now it'll be just hybrid saiyans and regen with 2 ""exclusive banner"" units on the last one (Janemba and DKP, because well, they won't show up in banners again soon), simply because other characters lack stats when compared to them and you'd be in a huge disadvantage playing with other teams (even androids are getting hit hard by the powercreep), expecially without good usage of side stepping.

\~335k power (Gogeta and Janemba) vs \~285k from the first batch of heroes (looking at the green-faced dude that keeps popping up in banners). That's around 18% power increase. It's a huge number, especially considering the numbers in the abilities also tend to keep going up and becoming stronger (which would be ""fine"" if the stats stayed more close). Not to mention the 5 star double buff.. That's just joking with people.

EDIT: Regarding sidestep, I think they went a good path to nerf it to prevent 100-0 combos, they just hit the numbers too hard. If it was an option doing it vs not doing it (for instance 20% more damage not doing it, but a bit less than what he had (regen-wise of ki + vanish + card draw) you would have an option. Now it seems you are much better off just chaining cards which is boring and just 100% favours stronger stat characters and ki regen doesn't even matter that much anymore."

So no, Democrats aren’t calling for violence, and even if they were, do you seriously have such a hard time defending yourself in an argument that you don’t even try and instead have to resort to classic “no u” tactics?

He leapt to his feet and strode to the kitchen, passing the dart board adorned with Steve Avery’s face, picked up the phone and made a call. A groggy Weigert picked up. 



W: “Nnnnyello?”

C: “Weigs. Do you sense it? A disturbance in the force. We have a job to do.”

W: “...affirmative. Who died and how close to Avery, that sonofabitch?”

C: “Irrelevant. Grab your frame bag and get over here pronto. Got your bonesaw?”

W: “Yup.”

C: “Rope? Climbing gear? Cotton swabs? Bleach? Bag of pipettes?”

W: “Yeah.”

C: “Box of charred human remains?”

W: “You think I was born yesterday? Of course.”

C: “Gather the old crew. Kratz, the entire DNA lab, we need everybody in on this.”

W: “Done. Nighthawk out.”

C: “I told you we’re not doing the code names, could you FUCKING just—“

W: “I said I’m on it, jeez o Pete.”

C: “You goddamn well better. Meet me at the quarry. Deep agent ‘Prince of the Hill’ has successfully infiltrated the Dasseys and they believe he’s their son.”

"&gt; So was the poison sent to Ted Cruz, Trump, and the pentagon a false flag too?

I'm pretty sure they caught that guy, so we'd be able to know now.  Since I didn't hear much about it from the Leftist media, it stands to reason that he at the very least was not staunchly on the Right (because they would have had a field day with that).

I think the Ricin attacks are different than these in one key way.  Those attacks targeted sitting, active, and influential people.  Cruz is actively campaigning for a pivotal seat on the Supreme Court.  Mattis is the current Secretary of Defense, making active military decisions.  Trump is, obviously, the sitting President.  The motive to harm these people has a logical consistency to them from the point of view of an adversary.

But Clinton, Obama, and Waters are nothing but gaffe machines and rallying points for the Right, and only Waters is still in any sort of power.  

Waters' divisive rhetoric has seen many Republican officials harassed in public, which is a huge turn off for moderates.  Obama's recent speeches have been exceedingly lame, and his crowds he's drawn have been tiny, which is a great photo opp for the Right.  And obviously the ways in which Clinton can galvanize the Right cannot be overstated.

I think framing terrorists like this bomber as unthinking, unhinged animals isn't very accurate.  It *could* be the case, but I think that's better reserved for random spree killers who literally just ""snap"" one minute. 

It's much more likely that terrorists with plans would act with *some* amount of internal logic.  Something that a normal person might not be able to understand, but something that's at least consistent.  But nothing about these attacks is consistent with someone who wants to help the Right and harm the Left.  As I've said, these targets are people who are only strengthening the Republican party, whereas the ricin attacks *would* be consistent with someone who wants to hurt the Right and help the Left, because they'd be affecting people with actual power who are actually *doing* things right now. 

I don't know who did this, but I don't think the chances that it's real are 100% and the chances it's a frame job are 0%.  I think it's probably 70% real and 30% fake."

Which allows extremely emotionally charged and subjective arguments to ruin millions of lives. 

Exhibit A: rape is punishable by death in certain regions but when a woman lies about rape it’s not as bad of a crime, but the man’s reputation will continue to be that of a rapist. No matter if the case is won or not. Rape “accusations” are social casket. 

Exhibit B: literally the smallest instances of pure sexual curiosity can be twisted towards any agenda of a white woman. This is One of the only areas in the judicial system where cultural lag is disregarded!

Exhibit C: People like Bill Cosby (who I am in no way defending) are getting the book thrown at them while white women who falsely claim sexual assault (like the white woman who got Emmett Till beaten to death and thrown into a river as a child) can admit to what they’ve done years later and the same actions aren’t being taken.

From my perspective God sees mankind in two groups: those who are His (who are saved) and those who are not His (who are yet to be saved). The harvesters and the harvest. The sheep and the goats. The virgins with oil and the virgins without oil.

Jesus lives for all mankind, but not all mankind lives for Jesus. Though He desires we all come to Him, many of us do not desire to go to Him."

But one week out from your half, it's really up to you.

I’m curious to know what you think is expensive for a beer. Big cities can be insanely pricey.

Also, there’s a dollar beer special certain days at cellar if you’re a mayo employee, and the Hy-Vee marketplace grill occasionally has dollar beer specials. I’m sure you can also find prices like that at dive bars too.

For nice beer, LTS runs like $6-7, little thistle is cheaper, ranging like $4-6, and forager has a wider range, but still some cheap options. Go to a large city like Boston and you’d be hard pressed to find nice beers for those prices—you’d be looking at around $10+, sometimes more for a comparable beer. Food is more too. Groceries are also more. Parking is more. Rent is more (a lot more). I’m guessing this is the largest city you’ve ever lived in? "

"&gt; That's the problem, they hardly have anything to convict. These guys are abroad in a country at war. Not really able to tape off a crime scene.

First, just because someone is in Syria, it doesn't mean all of the evidence is in Syria. Posting on social media creates a trail of both their current location and stores that data in servers which are readily accessible by Canadian Law Enforcement. Similarly if they call their family members back home, that creates call records. Their families also tended to acknowledge that they were in Syria. Which means the prosecution can go forward and state:

- This person traveled using a known route to get to Syria
- When headed to Syria he stayed at known stopping points connected to other foreign fighters going to Syria to join ISIS
- Called home from Syria
- His mother stated that she spoke to him when he was in Syria (hearsay rule doesn't apply if we can put his mother on the stand, ask her who she spoke with, then, if she changes her story, it can be brought up that she had said previously that it was her son)
- Posted facebook messages from Syria of him with ISIS members

From that the government can establish that he had gone to Syria to join ISIS. They might not be able to prove much more but that's a ten year sentence. If they get more evidence they can present it when they have it. But on top of all of that in some cases they have 

- The guy confessed to joining ISIS and / or
- The guy was captured with ISIS 
- The guy was sent an ISIS passport
- The guy was in communication with ISIS"

When f''(x) is positive, f'(x) is increasing, which means that the slope of f(x) is increasing (i.e. f(x) is getting steeper and steeper).

Anyway, our mom, without obligation took on the responsibility of being my sister's constant from a young age, through incredibly tumultuous times when her father, the state, and her foster parents were letting her down. My sister calls our mom ""her angel,"" and honestly it gives me such a good perspective because it made me realize the privileges I'm awarded purely by luck of who I was born to. All I can hope is to have even an ounce of the compassion and genuine purpose my mother has, and I can't thank her enough for giving me my sister. They are two of my favorite people in the world."

Let me see your resumé
"The NS link wasn't foolproof, nor did I expect it to be as I don't particularly care, but what it did help me with was removing almost all the eSports related content as that flooded the subreddit when Groups what going on, and at one time only 1 item showed when I used NS.

And that's interesting on the click only. After a couple of times I ended up making a new default bookmark with NS and put the normal one away so that I loaded that one by default. Out of curiosity can you get the analysis for those who visited NS overall?

I think it should stay for the benefit of filtering that content alone, it gets pretty overwhelming at worlds when everything is about the results, something in the game or someone did something semi cool. Sometimes I like to read on the normal side of the game where Karma will be busted with mana and CDR on allies :)"

TRUMP has instigated a culture of conspiracy theories that have continually been proven to be absolutely false and brought out the worst in his followers who belittle anyone that doesn't follow their ""leader"" with blind faith.  TRUMP has lowered the country to nothing more than a joke.  

This is an act of terrorism that when the FBI finds the person(s) responsible, whomever they are, we should all take a long hard look at the uncivil state of discourse in this country and realize we need to stop.  

This is not the fault of the media.  It is the act of an unstable person or group that believes they are doing the good work that TRUMP seems to espouse, eradicating Soros, Clinton, Obama, CNN and anyone else that he can blame.

After a week or two of being on keto your hunger levels should be a lot easier to manage with less fat required to feel full giving you a greater calorie deficit which you still require to lose weight.

For me,  I believe that two teenagers hooking up in a trusting relationship (FWB or dating) is far, far better than a one-time fling at a party.

Still, teens who hook up need to follow 3 basic rules:

1) Shouldn't be illegal in that locality/state

2) Should be able to pay for abortions and contraceptives with their own money

3) Should have family that don't care if teens have sex.

4) Taking nudes is fine in an ideal world, but people do abuse that. So people shouldn't said nudes with faces.

That is an ideal situation. Which OP of the post doesn't meet conditions 1 and 3 (not sure about 2 and 4)."

"This teacher has attempted to use professional protocols. None of your ""grounds"" stand. In addition, when a child causes grievous bodily injury to another person, police are absolutely allowed to be called and should be called. 

Your child's teacher is the one in danger, not your child. Police aren't coming with a gun threatening to shoot your child. They aren't tossing them into a cell with adult offenders of any kind. They likely aren't doing anything but taking a report and contacting you to let you know that your child is completely out of control. 

Supporting your child's aggression will never get them anywhere in life. Severely aggressive children have no place in a school setting with other children unless they've got a 1:1 at their side at all times . You should be thankful your kid's teacher cares enough about your ill-behaved child to call admin (and police when necessary) to handle the situation properly when they could just as easily abuse your child right back, quit, etc. 

You should be thankful there are teachers willing to put up with some of the bullshit these children (as amazing and wonderful as they are) can inflict. Without them, your child wouldn't be receiving a quality education. You should think about that before crying about how you'd ""sue their ass"" and what ""deep shit"" they would be in. 

Sincerely,
A TA that's been punched, pinched, severely bitten, scratched, kicked, bled all over. I'm EC-6th, SPED, and ESL certified. I have many years of experience. I don't *have* to put up with your kid's shit, but I do. Because I love them. I come back every day because I want to see them learn and grow into successful adults. But I do have limits, and so should every teacher here. 

The safety of those in the classroom is paramount. When your kid is completely out of control and causing serious injury, they need to be removed. If it takes police presence for admin to get their shit together, then so be it."

It makes my life have that much more meaning because how I act and effect the world around me is my own, it is my legacy. If I smile at u, u smile back. That wasn't god. That was my plan. And now that ur in a good mood u might make someone else smile back at you. I make change. We make change. We can't possibly add up every interaction you ever had as being completely chosen by a single entity. 

I can't waste my time praying to a god that may or may not be listening, who doesn't seem to care because he has his divine plan that will happen anyway. And if I get it just by asking then where in the hell are all the shit I worked hard to get and asked for but didnt get.

It's hard to think that there is a good benevolent god who loves me when I see myself and all my peers eating a metaphorical shit sandwich that was entirely thrust upon them. No one asks for a shit sandwich. So god must hate me or not give a shit. He must wish ill things on me, even though I am a good person, it was part of his plan. 

If you could prove to me that non-sinners had a marginally better life here on Earth I'd believe in a moment. You said that you are glad you won't be held to a high standard. I'd argue that no one ever has. Your telling me we are all doomed to eat shit sandwiches because we are being tested by God until we give into his faith near the end or our lives and start going to church every Sunday without fail and never even say the Lord's name in vain? Never told anyone a lie omitted any truth. Never was envious or lusted after someone other than their spouse? 


If u believe u should be damned to eternal fire for wanting to buy a nice car cuz ur neighbors all have nice cars I think you need to actually sit down and decide if u just have a set of morals and values that don't include needing a god to provide them to you. I didn't need to be taught that it isn't right to steal because of God. I needed to be taught it by my parents and my culture/environment. I'm not going to disgrace my parents by saying they were puppets of God's will. They worked hard to raise me. I was never told not to steal because it was illegal either. I was told not to steal because it sucks to have ur stuff stolen and in order for our lives to all get better we should all stop stealing shit. I was taught empathy. Not fear of burning in a lake of fire and brimstone.

I know I'm ranting at this point. I'm glad we had this convo so far. Thank you for responding as much as you have. Most people get upset if you challenge their religion as being in a sense a cult that was formed to control unruly masses and give them answers to their existential dread of what are we, where do we come from, what should we do while on this Earth, and what happens when you die. Which are the basis of christianity"

Genie High's music kind blends in with Gesu's music, which is not necessarily a bad thing I suppose. Their songs very much sound like songs Enon wrote for himself but had tricot's Ikkyu sing instead.

"PWAs still suck IMO

The issue is the browser vendors (Apple and Google).

Until there is a way to get some basic control over fundamental controls like `input` PWAs are doomed.

Try and create an input with auto-complete disabled and install it on Android... Google has decided to ignore your auto-complete instructions. If your input acts as a list filter, you’ll now have a browser-injected suggestion list rendered where you don’t want it and no way to do anything about it.

Try and apply some custom styling to an `&lt;input type=“search”&gt;` in mobile safari and see how much fun you have.

Until the browser vendors give developers the control they need over simple html controls, PWAs aren’t going to work for rich applications."

Currently I am doing paddles on the first set, and mixing in back, breast, and IM on the last 2 sets.  The easier it gets, the faster my paddle hundreds are and the more breastroke/butterfly I mix in.

"True. Nick Bostrom compared humans doing science to dogs walking on their hind legs. Dogs have the minimum physiology necessary to do that, but they are not optimized for it. It is the same with humans and performing science. We have the minimum brain physiology to do it, but we are not optimized for it. 

If we create something that is more optimized for it, even if it isn't true superintelligence (and is only slightly smarter than us) that will still change the world. 

I'm not sure how much of a threshold human complexity is. I'm wondering if human brain complexity is like human tranportation speed. The best humans can run at about 26mph. But there is nothing special about that number, and we surpassed it with internal combustion engines without even noticing. I'm not sure if it'll be the same with our machines, if hitting 190IQ is just something we will do without noticing it, or if we will build up to that point, and then slowly move past it (since the machines need us to invent them). 

Either way, interesting times. I just don't know what the timeline is. We may get ASI in 2035. We may not get it until the 22nd century. I have no idea. "

"I don't find that outlook very fair, all things considered. I don't have an issue with them selling ships, mind you, but I always question it when people try to suggest that the largest ships should require an organization to afford or some other nonsense, as if CiG hasn't already sold thousands of them to backers. If the people suggesting stuff like that get their way, this game is going to be pretty blatantly P2W; richer backers would have such an enormous wealth advantage if ships inflated in value that much. It will never be justified to lock ingame assets sold for real money behind thousands of hours of grind, if you don't need an org to buy it for real cash, you shouldn't need an org to buy it ingame, either. Operating it can be a different story, that can require more people since backers and non-backers will be equal on that footing either way.

Anyway, the only way SC avoids being P2W is if things sold for real money are reasonably earnable ingame, and at this point that includes everything from an Aurora to the Javelin. If someone can pledge for it, the game should be designed in a way that they could have earned it ingame for themselves as well. Doesn't have to mean trivial, can be a longer term goal, but there's a difference between non-trivial and ridiculous levels of grind.

I don't want a situation where the richer backers are cruising around in their own personal capital ships that are locked behind thousands of hours of ridiculous grind. The most I'd see as reasonable for a Javelin even is something like 800-1500 hours, that keeps it non-trivial, and beneficial to group up to earn, without being impossible to own one solo without buying it for real cash.

Ship prices for larger ships should be balanced around grouping up being a more convenient method of earning one quickly, but not a hard requirement; no ship in game should require thousands of hours of grind or something else ridiculous. It's a hard balance to find, because you don't want it to be super trivial or something, but if they are too high it would be blatantly pay to win after selling said ships to backers for cash. Buying a ship for cash shouldn't be the only reasonable path to having one for personal ownership.

Bottom line, a solo player should be able to work their way towards anything in the game that CiG has sold, including a Javelin as a longer term goal. It wouldn't harm the game balance in any way as long as operating it requires more actual players."

My former partner pressured me into getting a vasectomy when I was 21 years old with no kids, and when I told her I wasn’t sure about it she kept pushing until I did it. Felt so much regret years later as I realised I did want to have kids, and felt completely alone as I told no one else what I did out of embarrassment and shame. 

Many years later I got it reversed and it’s fine now. I’m fertile, and with a loving partner who wants kids as much as I do. But it was so expensive to reverse compared to the vasectomy itself and wasn’t a guaranteed success due to sperm anti-bodies your body develops post-vasectomy. I would have been spared a lot of suffering if I simply trusted my gut.

"&gt;It’s pretty disrespectful to confess your feelings to your good friend who is getting married in a week. Good friends would be respectful of the relationship, soon to be marriage.

Why do you feel the relationship is disrespected? 

&gt;I have guy friends and pretty much all of them are in relationships. If I felt myself developing feelings for them or something on their end- I’d back off my involvement with them. Being friends with them- I’m friends with their SO’s too. Having an opposite sex friendship means knowing where the line is and respecting it. Otherwise you are trying to be more than friends or you are being a terrible friend.

Perhaps a good friend is honest no matter what, and when that good friend shares about their feelings for another friend, it isn't a covert attempt to steal that friend but to actually just be honest with him or her (and all parties involded) and work through it. 

In my opinion, to do otherwise is to feed into a subtle culture of fear where everyone is afraid their partner is going to leave them.

&gt;Some men and women get off on “stealing” people’s mates. Just because they can and it feeds their ego. Not even because they have any real feelings or intent to be with that person. While it’s pretty difficult to assign intent here, waiting til a week before the wedding is pretty shitty.

QED"
"Ok. Not really into mustard, but I think I’ll try the balsamic vinegar or the avocado a couple times. How does MCT oil taste?"
"The +/-5k is a bit of an exaggeration (there is a bit of a skill difference there typically, but nowhere near as profound of one as the RP difference would suggest), but I've had matches with a 3k difference in RP where my opponent and I were dead even.

So first and foremost, I'd go into practice mode and really, really focus on trying to learn your character. If you don't know your options and what they do, you're significantly hampering yourself. It's ok not to know when you should use which attacks (that will come with time and experience), but you at least want to know how to do everything. From there, I'd also try and learn a few simple combo punishes. They don't need to be long or complicated (and at this point they shouldn't be), but you want to get familiar with thinking in terms of sequences of moves rather than just individual moves.

From there, honestly I'd just focus on going up through ranked. You're gonna get your ass kicked a lot, and that's absolutely A-OK. My first fighting game that I tried to get good at was MK9, and I literally think I lost 50 matches before I got a single win. But you know what? I stuck through it, and in every loss, I focused on learning something. Wasn't always a big thing (more often than not it was just something as simple as ""oh, maybe I should try blocking more""), but over time, it added up. In a similar fashion, that's what you want to do here as well. Focus less on winning, and more just on trying to learn things. The winning will come in time once you've learned enough. 

If you come across something that you just absolutely have no idea how you're supposed to deal with it, then don't forget about practice mode. Record your opponent doing whatever it is that they were doing, then see what options your character has to deal with it, and work on committing at least one of those options to muscle memory. The next time you match up against that opponent, you'll have a better chance of winning since you'll have learned how to deal with their particular shit.

Finally, focus first and foremost on your defense in-game. Attacking people and pressing buttons is fun, but if that's all you can do, you will lose every single game. The reason for that is pretty simply - in fighters, your offense has to follow your defense. What I mean by that is that you literally can't attack your opponent without a successful defense. If you try, you're just going to get stuffed and probably eat a hefty chunk of damage. Successfully depend against your opponent, though, and now it's your turn* (terms, conditions, and frame data may apply). It's also the most universally transferable skill - if you know how to defend on one character, odds are you'll be able to do so on another.

Hope this helps. I know it's difficult now, but if you stick through it, I promise it will be worth it in the end."
So sorry.
"Unfortunately that's really the only way these kind of PvE games can work. Players just give out so much damage that even a highly complex enemy would be melted in seconds, so they have to drastically increase health by AT LEAST 4x vs full groups."
"You know what, I agree (and somewhat changed my opinion now).

"This is similar to how I felt about my fiancé when I first met him! Our relationship was so easy, right from the start. We didn’t have drama and we fit together extremely easily. We have had our struggles but I knew that I loved him and wanted to marry him pretty much from the beginning. We have been together for about a year and a half and in that time he’s supported me through illness, financial struggles, the death of a family member, and so many other things and I couldn’t have made it through as well as I did without him. We have always been equal partners and fantastic teammates and it just gets better with time! "

"My experience from the other end of LANschool:

Unfortunately  right to privacy disappears when using their systems.   School systems should be used for school purposes only.  Not Facebook etc.

Basically every school and many corporate offices    have some form of product similar to LANschool.  LAN school is installed in classroom computers only, not personal student computers. 

It controls school computers on its network with the software installed. LAN = Local Area Network.   It is used to manage many computers at once, block access to certain websites, mute blank screens, ,monitor cheating etc. 

It doesn't save passwords.  But it has a keylogger so records CAN be used to find passwords.  

Hardware access is possible but if the webcam is activated then the webcam app would pop up.  Though I suppose the webcam app can be hacked to not pop up.  

Remote file transfers are documented and is useful if installing the same program on all student computers or sending/receiving homework assignments etc.

I have not heard of students taking these computers home but if the student is on a home network, that means it is on seperate network --LAN school has no control until reconnecting to the school network.  

If a student is taking their computer home than I agree that a notice should go out to students and parents making them aware of Lanschool saying not to store pictures, personal info etc.  "

Would it help if you used your health insurance to go see a therapist? Talking out problems is much better than keeping everything bottled up inside. I know from personal experience. I used to internalize my problems and eventually I developed an ulcer.

Do you have a local support network of friends and family? Sometimes it helps just being around people who care for you. 

If you want to build or expand your network, you might consider googling meetups in your area. Meetup is a social media site that allows people who share common interests to come together. 

Give your situation, you're probably not in the right mindset to do this right now, but it's something to think about for the future.

Honestly ... if you have a close relative or friend, take some time to go hang out with them. 

If you're religious, go attend a service. 

I used to have terrible problems with depression. It took me 54 years to learn that I'm autistic and the things that come naturally to other people such as building and maintaining friendships was really challenging for me. Since it turns out that I'm also predisposed towards being a reclusive introvert, trying to fit in to a largely extroverted world was incredibly stressful.

As to why I was depressed, it turns out that I was trying to be someone that I'm not. Outside of work, I'm not a social creature. I don't crave the company of others. I'm perfectly happy at home where I can putter about working on any number of projects. 

With this being said, I have experienced depression. I know what it's like to feel lethargic and to simply not want to get out of bed because I'm just not ready to face the world.

I understand and I sympathize. Unless you're also a reclusive introvert, I really think that you should get together with a close friend or relative ... and if you don't have anyone in your area, pick up a phone and call someone. 


Most people find it easier to face problems in the company of others.

"Seriously though what problems are you referring to? Are you talking about game mechanics you just happen to not like and think shouldn't be in the game? Or actual, real problems? Because Fortnite has few and far between of the latter. 

The game is definitely different in a sense than it was last year, but that's less to do with what has been added and more to do with the fact that it's now a sweat fest and people no longer play for fun. 

The game is going to continue to evolve and have more content. If you look back at Footage of Fortnite last year at this time, and take the nostalgia glasses off, you can see how much of a mess it was. Far less optimized, much worse graphics, you couldn't even pick up items half the time because they would cover each other, you couldn't build through fences and trees, so plant-life could literally cuck you out of a win, weapon balance was ABYSMAL, the spatial audio was basement-tier, half the map was an empty wasteland of nothing, building speed was slower than molasses, and the shield economy was an RNG nightmare. 

In just about every conceivable fashion, Fortnite is leagues better than it was last year at this time. I have nostalgia for ""old"" Fortnite as well, but it was a simpler time. No one built, stealth mattered, finding a legendary weapon was like Christmas, every change Epic made was welcome because no one cared about winning, it was all about having fun. 

Change your perspective. This game is never going to be the mythological competitive CS;GO machine you think it should be. It's just not what Epic has planned for it, and never was. This game has always been a lighthearted, silly, fun, entertainment-focused game from day 1. "

- It has a heat management problem where it any slight intensive use just burn through the battery (within 1 hr). This is a bigger problem during the summer where it's just always hot and the battery dies within 3 hours while not using it. This is the biggest issue and pretty much makes it unusable at times.

- It's noticeably slower, have a worse camera, and is thicker/larger than other phones of the same era. I really want a new phone by now. One with an actual good camera, snappy performance, and now so ridiculously wide in my pocket.

- The PKB was never up to Blackberry's standard, but it still works as normal.

- It lags when opening basic apps. As a modern smartphone I expect the calculator or notes to be opened instantly. The weather app takes 6 seconds to open.

- It gets stuck sometimes but not a huge problem.

- Overall, it's still usable, but it's definitely not worth the $700 that I bought it for. My $150 Q10 was much more reliable despite having very few features."

"They're essentially resource gathering points that you can temporarily claim and build up defenses at. They supply you with some building materials so you don't have to use your own crafting supplies.

Different workshops provide different resources. In the beta last night my buddy and I claimed Taylor's Racetrack which had a bunch of large mineral deposits (aluminum, iron and steel). We built a harvester on the aluminum node and some generators to power it. It produced 25 aluminum per hour so it's a bit of a time investment.

You also have to defend workshops from occassional AI invasions as well as other player groups who want to take it from you. This is one of the scenarios where the game employs open pvp."

Take photographs of the floor and include a newspaper or something with the date, and text or email them to her as proof you reported the necessary repairs. Keep documenting your interactions with her in a diary or over email/text. 

Your options are limited if you want to stay there. You can't make her behave like an adult, you can only limit your interactions with her. She can call you whatever she wants. Her threats to evict are empty, ignore unless you are served with legal papers. 

I might offer to replace the motion sensor light with a solar one, just to keep the peace but you're not under any obligation there. 

Does she have any family? Sometimes hostility in an elderly person can be a sign of dementia or mental illness. You might want to inquire with someone who knows her and suggest she be seen by a doctor. If she's alone it might be worth a call to adult protective services, and see if they can send someone to evaluate whether she seems fit to live alone etc. "

Since theres no data showing quakes pre-fracking, and assuming the tools used to measure these quakes above were implemented pre-fracking, why should someone assume fracking has caused these quakes?

"I believe he does say 'Time to Die' after delivering the following dialogue -

'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe, attack ships on fire off the shore of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate... All those moments will be lost, in time. Like tears in rain.''

''Time to Die.''

I believe in the soundtrack if it's not mentioned its to probably preserve a sense of emotion, like hope. The 'time to die' statement might have affected the impact of the scene and cohesion of the soundtrack whilst listened to on its own. Vangelis might have thought that it wouldn't be possible to give the listener a sense of context if hearing the soundtrack alone. Hence the many alterations of scenes and fleeting uses of dialogue in most of his tracks, which were an attempt to ground the music in the story. As at the time a lot of these composers were figuring out the potential of compositions in their scores to align with the beat and flow of a scene or movie. I might probably be wrong and that's fine, but I do get that feeling. I think both options work, but perhaps at the time they did not want to take another risk, in a series of risks, that in the end almost made the film fall apart - we all know how Bladerunner was cut short and commercialized into the theatrical release."

As more of our lives and the world around us enter the sphere of ""understandable"", they leave the sphere of ""supernatural""."

"Honestly once you hit Diamond to Masters there aren't any stress free comps since most people around you, will be high lvl or higher. All you can do is gear your heroes as close to perfect as you can and get highest lvl uw as you can. But Diamond is where whales starts to appear and the deeper you go blubberiest they become. Your comp is pretty decent and Miri is definitely the right dps if she's not doing enough dmg means there's something wrong with her gear. You probably should switch Pavel to Maria since she's meta along side Scarlet and I don't think there's anything wrong with Rephy unless you again didn't work on him properly. In Diamond to masters it's all about gears and uw \* lvl, the higher they are the higher you get as you don't see anything different comp wise sure there are wall comps but a Miri or Tanya or Shamilla should be able to break those through if they have high uw lvl."

Run because no one really uses cars in these small games because it just gives away your position greatly &gt; eventually 9 people left because you're running &gt; 3 more die because they're on the other side of the circle and you're running and have no opportunity to fight them. 6 people left: Everyone starts camping &gt; 2-3 people shot gun each other &gt; 3 left (including yourself) You run around shot gunning fences in hoping that campers come out of the cracks. Find one guy Kill him &gt; Either win or lose with 4-5 kills. Sucks ass. idk if my math is correct but you all get the point. It's stupid.

"Hay un tipo en EEUU que desarrolló una interesante idea: La Democracia por asesinato. 

Que sería algo así como:

Es legal asesinar a todos los políticos, cualquier político se mantendría en el cargo hasta que lo asesinen y se llama a elecciones. En casinos privados (cualquiera podría poner un casino) se tomarían apuestas para asesinar (de hecho para pagar un cazarecompenzas que lo haga) y para defender a un político (gasto en guardaespaldas), la gente pagaría con su apuesta el asesinato o la defensa de cada político y ganaría dinero según su apuesta, si el político vive otro año mas o muere. Los votantes no pondrían solo su fe en el político, sino algo mas doloroso, su dinero.

Es una idea muy graciosa porque le da un sentido nuevo al juramento: ""Prometo trabajar para el bién común de la sociedad o moriré por mi patria"".

Tiene algunos defectos y no hablo de razones morales contra el asesinato de personas. El problema de la idea que hay una desproporción evidente entre el gasto de un asesino oportunista y la enorme cantidad de guardaespaldas que se necesitarían para contrarrestarlo. La apuesta ""muerto"" ganaría siempre.

"By relationship do you mean can an alcoholic ever gain control of drinking? I like to think so every time I’ve started back but every time it’s an extremely slippery slope and I quickly find myself back to as bad as I was before stopping. 

If you mean can an alcoholic live with people drinking around them then I would say yes but it definitely depends on your level of temptation and how comfortable you are with it. I would never put myself in a situation that would jeopardize my sobriety. I’m beginning to enjoy life without needing alcohol and I’m finding myself to be more comfortable when other people are drinking around me without feeling tempted. Sure there are times when I feel tempted but really, if you just put one foot in front of the other and take it hour by hour or minute by minute, those temptations go away and you actually feel good about yourself that you were so strong to resist the urge.  So yes I do think it’s possible but always, always take it at your own pace and what’s comfortable for you!

"Just like dogs and many other animals, as a species we need someone who to lead us (figuratively or literally).This is especially important in order to make any progress/growth as a civilisation. Look at why the British royal family is still around.... They no longer do anything to lead/rule the masses per se, they just take the symbolic and unchallenged position of ""rulers of the land"" to create a sense of order and appease the masses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Same thing with the church (and therefore God). In today's world (particularly the western world) people no longer need the fear of Hell (or righteous punishment) to stop them from doing bad things to others. The vast majority of people these days know the difference of right and wrong. I could be a little naive here, but I bet that most people would not do the wrong thing even if they knew they could get away with it. So some people choose to believe in a supreme all knowing being because they subconsciously need a leader who is all knowing and supreme, not a leader who bows to the weakness and temptation of flesh. Additionally, some people choose to believe because they know that they have a predisposition or weakness for wrongful acts, and this is their way to self regulate their behaviour. And some people just really really need to be part of a group, and that group says believe.

We were actually herbivorous before we were meat eaters. You can see it from the fact that we have no traits that allow us to kill and eat animas raw without any tools. Our intestines are also too long to be meat eaters because they would ferment. Lions and tigers have much shorter digestive tracts for that reason. 

The question is why do we kill animals but call ourselves animal lovers?

Do you think it's okay to kill animals for pleasure?

"Oh god. No one (w/o serious mental health issues) wakes up one day and says 'I am actually this gender' without giving it any previous thought

"It's silence. It has the effect that one couldn't respond immediately, maybe because hesitation, or one was in such in awe, shock, temper etc. Other cases is just a pose in phrase, maybe because one is breathing too heavily to say a word. For example, ""…さよ…う…な…‥ら……"" could suggest that one wanted to say さようなら but maybe he was in severe condition to say thoroughly, so 1) (dots preceding) he opened the mouth but couldn't pull the first word out, 2) (dots in the middle) saying words slowly, separately, 3) (trailing dots) seeming like wants to say a few more things, maybe still mouth open or something but still hear no sound.

Is this unique thing? I thought any language would use the dots to add the flavor that way in writing out dialogue. I read novels time to time but I can't quite remember how they went. I'm sorry if I was missing points!"

"Hardly - there's barely any advertising for cigarettes/tobacco products allowed these days, yet people still manage to pick up the habit willingly.

It's a drug and it provides a high. It's legally obtainable and the availability is just about anywhere with a cash register. People want to get that type of high, so they do.

I smoked for a couple of years because I liked the smoking habit, and couldn't afford or get away with smoking weed in the same volume nor in the same places (like out in public, during the work day kind of times). I fortunately wasn't addicted to the nicotine, so I stopped no problem - but I can definitely see the ""benefits"".

It gives punctuation to the day, and you get that event to look forward to.

It gives you a break from whatever you're doing

It is a VERY social activity, wherein you get to be ""in"" on a lot of social things because of being out for the smokers breaks.

It's a way of managing stress, even though we know nicotine can increase stress (from withdrawal), the act of smoking and the chemicals you're breathing in has a calming sense about it.

I never really liked cigarettes, they taste and smell awful - but I stuck with it for a couple of years because I enjoyed what the cigarettes provided me with. It was a crutch, of course."

"If you can, organize an event like a block party. It really helps bring the community together and get to know each other in a fun way. This helps so much in terms of looking out for each other if you see somebody suspicious near your neighbor's house while they're out of town (same for you). If there are little children, they make friends easily, and parents can request to watch their kids while they go out for the night (switch roles). Your small community can address issues commonly faced and work together to solve it rather than just having one good neighbor do the occasional street cleaning. Saying 'thank you' doesn't go a long way if it's only one person taking the action, you know? But I see some really good suggestions that I may implement in my neighborhood. :)"

"&gt;Not if you’re playing her effectively. You need situational awareness, ult tracking capabilities (moreso than other heroes as you can actually do something about it), coordination, and timing.

Mindless because you just hack and translocate away without being in any real danger. Almost no situational awareness required.

&gt;This is the same point twice. I’m guessing you just used four to make more text so you could look smarter because there’s absolutely no objective value from including this twice. 

No it's not you fucking tool. High impact w/ little effort means you don't have to bring your A game to and a low Skill-to-Impact Ceiling means the impact necessary to win a game when you're playing Sombra is achieved even by low skill players.. Damn you're stupid.

Primary doesn't have a wide spread as you say, it's incredibly OP in fact. One of the bigger difference between a bad player vs better player on Sombra is when they choose not to hack.. it's for example very often stupid to hack a junkrat because you're only increasing the likelihood of you dying to him..

&gt;Not really. You can still move at least. Better than any other CC in the game.

?? You're beyond stupid if you can't see how it's anti-fun to have a hero that counters everyone without having a single counter herself.

"&gt; Well, is Star Trek Discovery nice?

Dunno. Haven't watch it. If it ever shows up on netflix, maybe, but I'm not paying for CBS All Access to do it. From the little I do know, Discovery continues the trend set by Abrams verse by ignoring the many years of previously established Star Trek canon. This is espeically troublesome since it is set 10 years before TOS (The original series) so deviations will be very apparent. It's very likely that I would not like it for similar reasons that I do not like Abrams Trek, but since I haven't seen it, I'll just say that I've heard some decent things and I've heard some horrible things. The other issue is it's still fairly new. Even TNG, which is seen as the pinnacle of Star Trek by many, had a pretty meh first season. In any case, I hate the fact that it's hidden behind a paywall enough that even if I heard it was awesome, I still wouldn't sign up for CBS All Access."

Socialism isn't the end all be all, but it does some things right. Don't assume that if we move away from capitalism that these things will disappear. A mostly free market drives competition, but the government SHOULD have a stake in ensuring that these utilities/public services work in favor of the PUBLIC.

That's my 2c on it.

"I think it could be argued that during the transition from the feudal system to capitalism, the social and economic structure were seen as fluid/adaptive (and consequently were probably more flexible). capitalism is functionally the backbone of our society, and so people assume that this oppressive, historically contingent economic structure is a necessary aspect of human existence.

But what if we sent all contemporary Marxist philosophers into the past, during that fragile transitionary period?

"[this link right here ](https://imgur.com/gallery/MNS6eql) is a collection of pics and vids from both nights and pics with a few of the guys we were lucky enough to catch. So grateful even to just share a word or two with them for real. A few details of meeting the guys:

After waiting on line for 3 hours out of 6, my best friend Delaney decided to walk to a Starbucks 1 block down and just happened to see Ian getting out of a taxi. What luck right? Jealousy. She also got to be on stage with them @ Irving plaza in feb so I reek of envy. Around an hour after that Kevin doan and ashlan came outside stopping at certain parts of the line. and I believe interviewed one or two people, possibly similar to Love Your Parents tour vlog? Such a nice guy! Excuse my Eskimo look with doan it was freezing in New York. After the show on the second night we were just walking around the venue after the show hoping to run into any of the guys. Dom and his girl came out first and they were so smiley and looking happy together n shit everyone was gushing over them it was lit and he took a huge selfie with everyone and Delaney got to be in which was awesome. Then it was 15 mins of nobody coming through the same door and I was getting restless. We walked down the block more toward the door they were coming out of and was first lucky enough to catch ashlan alone waiting for a taxi. I asked for a photo and he said he doesn’t do photos and I made a point to really tell him how outstanding his work is and how against the grain and gritty and fucking awesome some of the moments he’s captured are. He did sign some stuff for us though and exchanged a few words before hopping in an Uber. Then we turned around because we heard noise from a crowd near where we originally came from so we speed walked to the corner of the venue and almost literally bumped into Romil and his girl and Delaney hugged him i dapped him and told him he’s going down in history as a producer. Then Matt appeared out of nowhere fast and was nice enough to dap me and I told him he killed it and we were instantly swarmed by hella people trying to get autographs and pics. Wasn’t even too many people waiting, everyone just got too excited. Was nice to talk for even a second though. Joba came out the back door towards us and I was smiling and I just said “bro you’re the fucking man. I love you, You are an inspiration” he smiled and shook my hand and I wasn’t even nervous I just loved all of it. I asked Joba to hit the planet greebus and he fucking did. Fulfilled. After that we waited another 30 mins til around almost 1Am and decided to hit the road. I was already feeling like a winner. I also tried asking Paul Rudd to say “I’m gay” but he just smiled and waved. Hope he found it in good fun. Wish we got to see merlyn and bearface, but at least they tweeted me a few weeks ago (see my previous posts lmao) That was my  Brockhampton filled 2 day adventure. I fuckin love them yo goddamn it shit "

"Had DI btw...forgot to mention that at all through typing all of this lol. Also, if you have any specific questions feel free to ask!

My recovery was pretty simple and easy, which I was really really not expecting. I had had a reduction two years prior, with the same surgeon and at the same surgery center, and recovery for that was so bad, and I was so miserable. But with top surgery I was just so happy. I think it was because with top surgery I knew I really really wanted and needed it, while with the reduction I was already realizing I was trans at that point and my parents had said ""just do this first and see how you feel"" about the reduction, so it felt like an unnecessary stepping stone for me. But then at top surgery consults my surgeon unknowingly made me feel a lot better about it...I had had a large and saggy chest before, and he said that having had a reduction actually made it easier for him to do top surgery in a way that would give me decent results. So that was kinda ok I guess lol. 

Was glad I got stool softeners, and used them even though I actually wound up not taking any of the prescribed vicodin. Sometimes your body just going through something physically traumatic like surgery can just put your system into a bit of a shock. A lot of people wind up not even needing the prescription painkillers, and just take things like ibuprofen. So make sure to have some of these things on hand at home. I had really really really bad back pain post reduction surgery (literally one of the top two pains I've ever experienced, right up there with the time I fractured my shin walking into a toilet lmao). I was expecting this pain with top surgery as well, and it was honestly the thing I was worried about the most, but luckily it didn't happen with top surgery. The reason it happened with the reduction was just that my front felt soooo vulnerable post op that my back muscles were tense 24/7. But I was prescribed valium with both surgeries...and I'm not really sure why, but with the reduction it really helped my muscles to relax post op. If you're worried about muscles getting tense, or finding it hard to sleep, you could ask to be prescribed valium as well and it can help you relax. 

I was stinky af like seriously stinky those first two weeks when I couldn't shower. It wasn't just because I couldn't shower...it was just these like smells from the surgery, and smells from my body healing, and they were just nasty smells lol. Baby wipes when I couldn't shower helped make me feel a little more fresh. Spraying nice smelling antiperspirant and things like fabreeze over myself helped as well. 

The best thing for me post op was the comfort food my dad made me, and the understanding my best friend had. My best friend usually likes to stay hanging out for long periods of time, while I usually don't like to stay out long, and want to go home after a bit, she's usually understanding of this about me, but would usually only ask if I was tired and wanted to go home when we were leaving one place and deciding what to do next (she drives, I don't lol). After I got the drains out and was more able to go out and about some, she was just more attentive to that my energy might be super low. So that was kinda nice. 

On the flipside, recovery from a small revision a year later was the worst. I was just getting a small revision to each side for some small dogears, and was getting it done in office, not in an OR. My surgeon had said I could go back to work the next day. Everyone else I talked to about revisions said they were totally fine afterwards. I was still kinda worried, so I made sure I had the next day off from work just in case I wasn't feeling up to it. Turns out I felt like shit after it, and was in so much pain and uncomfortableness, and one side kept bleeding. I wound up taking like 3 more days off from work. I used some of the prescription pain meds from top surgery...when I had not used them at all post top surgery. I wasn't depressed at all after top surgery, but I was a little after the revision. I hadn't really thought anything about my results looked too bad, I was just happy to be rid of my chest. I was sure no one would really see me shirtless, so I didn't really care bout the dogears, but my surgeon still wanted to do the revision, so I did it anyway. So I was kinda depressed afterwards because I felt so crappy it felt like it wasn't really worth it. Though now much later, I do actually see the difference of how it looks now and how it looked before the revision. And I am more comfortable with how it looks now than I was with how it looked before the revision."

I typically have a rough idea what my day looks like as I go.  If I have a bunch of eggs and sausage and cheese at breakfast I know my dinner is going to have to have lean meats.  If I skip lunch I might plan a protein bar as a post dinner treat to up my protein.  If I have a higher carb veggies like green beans I know I'll have to watch my carb count more closely.  Plan your meals to be mostly meat and veggies and it's pretty easy.

This has nothing to do with ""times changing."" Times changing has to do with societal improvements, like newer modes of transportation, forms of communication, different fashion. People said times were changing when vinyl was replaced, but it's making a comeback because people like to own music. A digital version of a game isn't an improvement over a disc. 

When you buy a game digitally, you're buying a key to play the game. That key is tied to your account, if you lose it, violate Sony's ToS, someone steals it, or down the line when Sony inevitably drops a game from their servers, you're shit out of luck. Hell even account corruption can happen. Same with music, different streaming services are losing music all the time due to legal disputes, same with Netflix. Amazon isn't going to break into your house and steal a movie because they don't carry it anymore."

"Uber are the next Enron.

This is from memory so may not be accurate.

Uber started out as pretty much a limo service after Travis Kalanick sold his P2P service Red Swoosh (there was controversy over tax fraud too). It was an idea he came up with in his ""Jam Pad"" the name he have the place where he and his friends would work out business ideas.

The business model of ride-sharing was copied from competitors after seeing it's success, but they operated in places where operating ride sharing was illegal, and the competition didn't bother so much with.

They don't pay drivers, spy on users, and got to where they are by bullying governments and the lobbying others to make their business model legal. They don't pay staff fairly, and then argue that the tax and employment laws are wrong.

The problem isn't that they pushed something new and we're successful, the problem is they are trying to change too many things, and that may very well suggest that like Enron, they were not accounting in the real world."

"The rivalry between Michigan and Ohio goes back to the Toledo War. Essentially Michigan claimed a strip of land that included Toledo when they petitioned for statehood in 1835. Ohio also declared that territory, and both sides deployed militias. The Michigan militia occupied the Toledo area and dared Ohio's to come attack as they ""welcomed them to their hospitable graves.""

Though the war never ended in an casualties, the militias did a fair bit of shouting back and forth, shots were fired in the air, and Ohio claimed that 9 of its men were taken prisoner. Most of the actual fighting was done politically, however. Ohio passed laws allowing governance over the area. Michigan made it illegal for anyone outside of Michigan to govern the area and made some arrests accordingly.

Eventually, Ohio won out the political battle having already been a state. They had Presidential backing and was a key swing state for votes. By 1936, Michigan was backed into a corner and gave up Toledo, but gained statehood and the western 3/4ths of the Upper Penninsula. At the time this was not taken well by Michiganders, but later the region was found to be rich for mining. Michigan became the 26th state officially in January 1837, with no Toledo but two peninsulas. Also Michigan and Ohio still hate each other."

"""Outside of reality"" may be a bit of a misnomer, but there are some places in Lumin that may apply. The Tenebric for instance is a non-euclidean abyss swarming with metaphysical dragons. You can actually get there pretty easily by airship. If you wanna be driven insane and then eaten.

Above the Tenebric exists the Aetheric, which is a shifting dreamworld which alters itself to match your expectations/mental state. It's where your soul goes when you die. To get here you'd need a magitech engine the size of a small city, a containment suit to keep your soul from leaking out and some balls of steel, 'cause the last time someone got caught breaking into the Aetheric the planet was shattered.

Beyond all that is the Tempest, or more contemporarily known as ""chaos"". An ever teaming sea of everything and nothing devoid of any logic. There's not really any discernible way to get there, nor any reason to, you'd just end up getting obliterated and reconstituted infinite times an instant for the rest of timeless eternity.

Finally you get to the Void That Is. This is a no-place where boundaries do not exist. Matter can technically exist there, however because there is conceptually nothing else within the Void anything there becomes infinite, as there is nothing there to **not** be the thing. There are stories of dark, secluded places on Lumin where one can simply walk into the Void and become transcendant. These are probably just a myth. Probably.

Then there's the Void That Isn't. Which doesn't exist, so whatever."

If you love this woman, for the love of all that is holy, do not make her stay there. Everyone involved is going to have a *bad time*. It will be bad for you, bad for her, and especially bad for your children. That will strain your marriage, jeopardize your new promotion, and traumatize your children.

"There is a saying or concept ""death of the author"" where it the interpretation or understanding of the work shouldn't depend on the author. Not to discount your curiosity of the artist's intention with his or her work, but more to say any one person's interpretation isn't more valuable than another's including the author.


To the original question of ""why are some of the kids crying?"", my personal thoughts on it range from them crying tears of joy being with Jesus, to well... they are toddlers and they could be crying about some random thing. As toddlers just being toddlers. Crying and learning about emotion is normal for a kid of that age."

"Your therapist doesn’t seem to be very good, a therapist should never keep you from talking about something because it makes them uncomfortable. Also, I’ve been in a similar situation (not including being sexually harassed/assaulted) where this person would hold their depression over my head as a reason for me to stay their friend. 

I broke off the friendship and they attempted to reconnect later but I told them I was uncomfortable with it and they threatened to kill themselves. I called her boyfriend and made sure she was alright but I still kept the friendship broken off. 

These types of people will use their depression as a sword and shield to manipulate you and keep you there, and to get what they want, these people will take up your life and if they threaten to kill themselves, call 911 so that if the threat turns out to be true their attempt will hopefully fail. While this sounds harsh, in the end what they choose to do with themselves is not your fault or your responsibility.

Side note: I do not believe that everyone with depression is like this. I know that depression does not equal manipulative."

"Hey man great post. Very relatable to be honest. When I first started showing my friends 2 and RRNC in 2013 they thought Mac was a genuine freak and were not digging the music at all. Then Salad Days comes along and all of a sudden it's cool to like Mac DeMarco so everyone starts playing his music everywhere. Since then I've always felt a little bit jaded about the fanbase because I can never quite tell if people are legit into the music or are just doing it for the image. 

You're also right about this subreddit - it used to be so good and it felt like tightnit community. But now every other post seems to be a shitpost or a account of a bad fan experience. So much so that I actually unsubscribed a while ago. "

"&gt; Quindi secondo te il Presidente della Repubblica italiano e la Corte Costituzionale italiana sono in parte o del tutto organismi politici vincolati all'appartenenza politica di coloro che li hanno eletti e che di conseguenza ogni loro decisione può e deve essere contestata in quanto viziata dalla politica.

Sì certo, Scalfaro era estremamente politico, anche mattarella lo è stato mettendo il veto su savona, la ragione per cui abbiamo un presidente è che garantisca la pacifica trasmissione del potere da una legislatura alla seguente non ostacolarla. In democrazia tutto deve poter essere contestabile, poi nella dialettica politica si arriva ad una conclusione, ma il popolo è l'unico sovrano art 1 della costituzione.

&gt;Posso capire che si affermi che ci sono delle ingerenze della politica nelle istituzioni europee (e italiane) ma da qui a sostenere che non siano in grado di emettere giudizi non politici ce ne passa.

ma scusa se la commissione non fosse un organo politico per che cavolo si farebbero le elezioni europee? La commissione è un governo nominato da un parlamento sostenuto da una maggioranza politica composta da S&amp;D + PPE che in italia sono rappresentati da PD e FI guarda a caso quando un primo ministro appartenente ad un partito della maggioranza europea chiede un deficit di 2.9% allora gli fanno il favore se è uno dell'opposizione fanno... opposizione. Non è una cosa nascosta le elezioni si fanno, le maggioranze sono pubbliche, i gruppi parlamentari europei sono dichiarati, Moscovici è dello stesso partito di renzi, la Mogherini è del PD stesso, poi Timmermans e altri, sarebbe come dire che Salvini smette di essere leghista ora che è ministro degli interni."

As a human, your existence precedes your essence.  You aren't like a hammer which was built and created with a specific purpose; finding purpose is your responsibility.  You can either kill yourself, turn to some external organization for meaning (religion, cults, military, etc.), [try to keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZYJKtOjJXg), or, you can embrace the absurdity of living a full life in a meaningless universe.

The blind leading the blind works both ways: if you ask someone who’s been an engineer and only an engineer his whole life, you can have just as bias a view as what you’re criticizing.

Engineering is no longer as glorious nor prestigious as it was 20 years ago. Employment rates for grads ARE dropping, half my graduating class (16) still doesn’t have a job.

"To be clear, I’m a non-believer at the moment.

Parents try to protect their children and for some that is apparently being bi or gay. I know many people that associate being gay with being frivolous and promiscuous. This is just simply untrue. That association I had for a couple years even though in heart I was a bi man. I didn’t hate LGBT individuals but I saw them as being completely wrong, about everything probably. It was really only until I talked to a few my friends that happened to be under the LGBT spectrum that I started to not associate them that way. I realized they that are people, human beings.

From that time forward I never viewed being gay in of itself a sin as i didn’t view it as a choice. 

Your parents are most likely in the latter category. To them there is a disconnect between them and LGBT individuals. To them, LGBT are alien, something mysterious and not fully understood.

My point in all of this is try and discuss it with them. Understanding breeds tolerance and tolerance breeds peace. Your parents love you as I’m sure you know but explain to them your side. I can’t promise that they’ll accept you or perhaps they’ll ever accept you. Some people are that headstrong. But at least you made the effort to help them understand you. 

For what to do if that doesn’t go well either might be where I let someone else advise you but in the meantime, stay positive and keep your head high. You did a brave thing especially in a very religious household. You are an inspiration to many people that struggle to say that they’re bi.

You’re a beautiful person, remember that."

"Erk. Wrong button!

You can use all or a combination of those methods. AutoRemote or Join can send webhooks to IFTTT, Google Assistant and maybe Alexa could also directly control the lights (and use IFTTT IF's to detect this and send back to Tasker via a webhook to AutoRemote or Join) and use widgets.

A lot of these bulbs (like my ""Smart Life"" bulbs) use a very weird backend called Tuya. This is what you need to find out, as it'll help narrow down if they can be locally controlled as well as cloud. Fortunately mine can be, but not directly from Tasker (limitation in crypto available). Some are more generic than others. I'm a bit of a control freak and always want local access.

"One of the biggest things here is transition. Like, one of my gfs flops around a ton during oral. Just naturally does, it drives her nuts and she can't begin to lay still, by the time she cums I have to hold her down. I know through experience with her now that when she hits that point, she's going to cum very soon and I just have to keep going. And I can tell when she's done cause she gets sensitive and needs a minute of no clit stimulation after a big orgasm.

I still cannot tell when exactly she starts cumming if she doesn't tell me. I know her so damn well but the exact point she goes from building to cumming is pretty much impossible to tell. She's been thrashing for a solid ten seconds by the time it starts according to her. She has thrashed without cumming plenty. 

I ask new partners. I always check about it. Experienced dude doesn't mean mind reader. Some girls are harder to tell, some girls easier. A good partner figures it out."

"&gt;The hi-res, close-up photos conveniently released for us. You can clearly see the un-postmarked stamps. Those packages were not mailed anywhere.

Can you link the images? Has every package had its picture taken? Has every part of the packages' surface been photographed to demonstrate that there are no postmarks? Is it impossible for packages to be sent through the mail without a postmark- are USPS mail clerks always diligent about postmarking every package that passes through? Hasn't USPS become relaxed about postmarking packages now that most stamps are peel-off?

You realize that the USPS will be able to trace the packages, e.g. who sent them, where they came from, etc. if they were mailed via USPS, right? That means, in order for the packages to have been delivered without a logistics service, the USPS has to be in cahoots with the Deep State or whatever. As does Trump's Secret Service, the various local police stations investigating the packages, and Trump's FBI. All of these large, different organizations are collaborating with each other to stage a false flag, yet they are, according to you, so incompetent that some random internet posters with no investigative background can foil the plot within hours. If USPS is in on it, then why couldn't the packages have just been sent via USPS to make the scheme look more legitimate? Hell, sending packages via USPS would be much, much easier and look much more legitimate than having agents along the east coast all dropping packages at around the same time a postal worker would deliver packages. Yet, despite the fact that the group responsible for this is some shadowy omnipotent entity that pulls the strings of major large organizations, some of which Trump is the head and of which his officials are leading, they can't send some packages through the mail or otherwise stage a false flag attack that an internet poster can't immediately detect. Really makes you think... "
"Nah I’m not that extreme. I can hate the way the companies treat their reps, and how their reps treat other people, without necessarily hating the people who are involved with it either on the corporate side or on the rep/Hun side. The products themselves aren’t harmful (at least, for the most part) so I don’t think that packing and shipping them is morally questionable.

"Your best bet is to invest regularly, no matter what, and not check or make changes to your investments. This is assuming you’re investing in total market index funds. Empirical studies have focused on how investor behaviors panned out over the long term. Simply put and on average, the folks who did the best were the folks who laughably forgot their investment existed, or purposefully rode the market out, and just let time and compound interest do the work. Invest in low to zero fee index funds, buckle up, and have no fear."

"Because touchless doesn't get the car clean enough for me. I've done this for many years on my 2003 Old Aurora and now on my 2011 Cadillac CTS and haven't gone through. I use Meguiar's M205 which isn't that harsh.

"My biggest regret in life was buying a Ford F-150, it’s repair bills were on par with a recently out of warranty BMW I owned that was not worth it either, except at least the BMW drove nice between shop visits, the Ford drove, ran, handled, and felt shitty, it had literally 0 redeeming qualities. 

So I’ve switched to Toyota/Lexus, my repair bills dropped to 10% what I spent on my Ford that was half the price of an equivalent Tacoma, or my BMW that was half the price of the equivalent Lexus.

The true value of these cars is easily shown in their stark used price differences for the same year/mileage equivalent car between the brands. 

And FWIW, parts for Toyota/Lexus have actually been on par if not cheaper than Ford’s. 

I really appreciated how for their drive shaft u-joint, they took a normal $30 u-joint, added 4 tiny watch battery spacers to the end so only theirs would fit, and charged $215 for the damn thing, and no one else sold one that included the spacers, I tried 3 different auto parts chains. At least I’m not as unlucky as the guys who got the versions with the permanently stamped in ones, they were livid on the forums when they discovered a bad u-joint meant they had to buy an entire new driveshaft. 

Fords are designed with the exclusive goal of how cheap they can make the purchase price, durability and repair-ability be damned. Don’t confuse cheap to buy with cheap to own."

"Have you looked at your own video that you linked to?

You work at Corsair, I'm sure being forced to work in the iCue ecosystem makes you believe that the video linked is ""so easy"" yet it really isn't.

You should have a color picker with no drop downs and simply paint what you want.  The video shows that iCue requires you set up two separate color channels from a multi click menu.  I can't tell you how confusing this is for new users.

Instead of hitting ""+"" you should be able to simply pick a different color and start painting away as you want.

I can't tell you how many times I've shown someone iCue and a few weeks later I get a phone call because they can't remember the steps to do simple color changes.

THAT is telling me your UI sucks, overcomplicated, and has too many steps.

It's been this way for years.

I'm the chief of the hospital and we had an IT guy who designed systems like this requiring extra steps and other physicians were constantly confused.

I ended firing that guy because he refused to take our suggestions and claimed he made it as simple as it could be.  I then had the hospital contract out a software implementation user interface team to clean up the prior guy's ""easy"" interface where users didn't have to make extraneous clicks.  Years later, no complaints from the other physicians.

You guys are at Corsair have it stuck in your head that the interface is ""fine"" and ""once people get used to they remember it.""  I'm telling you this isn't the case.   Not even close.

Your UI sucks.  It needs an overhaul and you need to implement real the suggestions I see over and over in this forum.

It's gotten to the point where I no longer suggest Corsair keyboards to family and friends just because I don't want the headache that is iCue.

Chew on that."

"Oh god my cat scratches the baby all the time. Jerk face cat has bitten the baby once or twice. Baby is 17 months and adores cat - does not understand his boundaries and body language.

First time it happened I was beside myself. Called pediatrician and googled frantically. Basically was told wash and disinfect wounds and monitor for infection. Pediatrician was pretty blasé about it which made me feel better.

At this point it just happens occasionally. Toddler is getting better at giving appropriate cat affection, cat is getting better at moving.  If cat is not actively attacking baby and is only aggressive when baby “ attacks” then it’s less of a big deal then if cat was going for the baby for no reason. 

Always supervise them closely, be aware of cat signals that show it’s uncomfortable and keep modeling and enforcing safe behavior around cat.   Sometimes you can do everything right and it will still happen.  Short of getting rid of cat that’s just all you can do. "

"Linux mint can be a ""good starter distro"" but they have an unorthodox approach to providing software packages from multiple distros and do not package they're own software instead relying on other distros to provide software packages.  
  
This ""bag of mixed nuts"" approach as the debian developer mentioned can be a significant source of problems. if there was a food analogy that compared to linux mint it could be akin to going grocery shopping to purchase eggs for breakfast then later opening your tasty eggs and discovering three different species of egg, three different colors of eggs none of them the same size in the same egg carton."
"In another more recent post in her story, she tags the company who makes the band. I’m guessing she used the cloud to cover the label knowing that the company would want nothing to do with that sort of post.

"I don't think it is necessary, I think that the fact that he doesn't is what causes a large portion of what he and his fans view as fanboy flame. He's often met with criticism that he just dismisses in a patronizing way, such as in this video relating to the thread on the last video. I used the word factually, which admittedly you're right isn't the best word choice, because in this case I feel the example is pretty clear. I'm referring to a specific video, a specific comment thread, and it's pretty easy to go see that the types of comments he's referring to are not representative of anywhere near the majority.

I never claimed that he literally never responds to criticism. That's just a straw man. 

My question and point was very specific. I wonder if he has considered that a.) He writes off some legitimate criticism as illegitimate, and b.) That some of the criticism he faces is as a result of the dismissive and patronizing way in which he approaches opposition from the community. I'd be satisfied either with a no, or with a yes followed by a rationale."

So wages have stagnated and a ton of people barely live on minimum wage. So clearly minimum wage needs to go up to match cost of living and inflation. Again, wages acroos the board have flatlined.

For there to be 500 trans actors SAG would need 12.4 million members, or trans people would need to make up 0.4% of the population. 

In reality, it’s estimated that 0.6% of the American population is transgendered [(source - PDF warning)](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/How-Many-Adults-Identify-as-Transgender-in-the-United-States.pdf)

Regardless, your math ends up being pretty close to capturing the right amount of transgendered actors SAG should represent if SAG mirrored the general population, which is hilarious to me."

"This is my first Mazda, I only had my 2015 Sport Hatchback Manual for 3 weeks now.. and I am a noob to driving Manual.
I stayed away from Mazda for a long time from hearing the horror stories of Mazda ownership. But honestly, who knows it could be driver neglect. My previous cars: Mustang fox-body, and a Honda Prelude. I didnt want a manual back then because of the traffic where I lived. But now I got one in the Mazda!  

This manual is so easy to learn on. By Day 3 I was blasting around curves, and this car just wants more and more. It is so rev happy and torky in certain gears. Depending on you - do you need all the bells and whistles go for the grand touring, I am satisfied with the Sport. I dont know what base has.. but I am sure its just as satisfying.

I only wish I learned manual years ago.. the interior is planned out very nicely.. and I dont even have the grand touring edition. 

I upgraded the entertainment center to Android Auto and also the Speedometer app via AIO... omfg the Speedometer is the best.. I feel like I am in a race car. 

I have caught plenty of people looking and wondering whats that all about. 

 Again, I am a noob to manual but with this car it just feels so great from the steering wheel to the road. I dont get why Mazda didnt market this car as hard as Honda did with its Civic. I am very satisfied. "

"My favorite Xbox memory is playing the original Bioshock on 360. My friend worked at a Blockbuster here in our fairly small town, and he was able to snag a copy of the game from work a few days early for us to play on the weekend. A group of friends sat in a creepy, dark basement playing the game, which had a fairly eerie vibe at times. I’ll never forget how enthralled we were by that game at the time and how excited we were to be playing it. We passed off the controller all night long and took turns playing different segments. It was an absolute blast.

"I'm going to say recomp with a view to a slow lean bulk. Eat at a 20% deficit or at maintenance (TDEE) on your off days and eat at a 20% surplus on the days you work out.

You are pretty lean, but not lean enough to do a sufficient traditional bulk (20% surplus every day) because it wouldn't take long until you add 10-15lbs of fat (therfore only a few lbs of muscle mass) before your abs disappear and therefore need to cut again.

Also, due to hormones (fat releases oestrogen) it's easier to add muscle mass when you're lean. Even then, you can only add so much muscle mass at a certain rate and anything beyond 20% surplus on work out days is superfluous. Then you'd have to ""pause"" your muscle building progress if you go on a cut.

You have a great foundation to work from, what you need is to just add size. A lean bulk is what you want - it's easier and you get to look/feel good year round too."

With 2 Myrrh, they can give each other Armor March buff and solo the whole TT."

Probably because I mentioned that’s where I’d like the club the meet.
"I had the Line 6 PODxt, which was the next generation AFTER the 2.0. It was a decent piece of kit that covered just about everything you'd ever need plugged into your headphones or mixer or powered speaker. The common thinking is that players who are new to guitar or new to effects should start with an affordable multiFX like this, so they can learn which effects they like (e.g. overdrive, phaser, delay) and which effects they don't like (e.g. compression, flanger, tremolo), so they don't waste a bunch of money choosing their first individual FX pedals. It's not a bad strategy.

I'd also argue that digital, amp-less rigs are probably the future for most players: Kemper, AxeFX, Line 6 Helix, Positive Grid BIAS, AmpliFire, etc. It's easier to carry a \~15 lb modeler than \~100 lbs of amp and pedalboard gear. Plus the modeler sounds the same every night, unlike your tube amp and pedalboard, which will be sensitive to room placement, temperature and the skills of your local soundperson. The modeler has much fewer points of failure, unlike a pedalboard with 5-50 patch cables and a tube amp with 2-12 tubes.

There are plenty of other modelers you could choose besides the Pod 2.0, at pretty much any price point from $50-$3000. Line 6 is pretty famous for having great user interfaces, but many criticize their tones and their re-sale values aren't great. Just as a contrast, Boss MultiFX user interfaces are pretty widely despised."

It's all a ponzi scheme and most suburban towns aren't doing well, suburban houses lose value reliably and they are doubling the costs of money services (its an estimated nearly $10,000 per year cost to maintain this road). There is a 30 year delay, before the road needs new paving or other similar expenses. The multiple malls from the 90s around here has basically fallen apart and has almost surely been losing money. Suburban places are built for a single use whereas urban building has been used for so many uses.

The old version of the strip mall has basically not lost value since it was built in comparison. If the taxes were lower downtown then there would be lower vacancy rates if you want to bring that up."

"Part 1  


\&gt; I was at work until 4 in the morning doing her job for her.

**Why did you do that?** Perhaps consider that you could have used her strategy and... just left, especially once your paid hours are up. From this paragraph I'm getting that you see yourself as Atlas, with the planet on your shoulders. You don't have to do the jobs of incapable people; in fact, if she's unstable and leaves her work undone, file a complaint and get her out of the job she can't handle. Let her work go undone until the higher ups notice and fire her and put someone actually competent in charge: maybe you! **Never ever take on increased job responsibilities without increased financial compensation or you perpetuate the system you hate.**

\&gt; I would have been held at a higher standard because I am a man.

Some women are weak because it's in their DNA. Some women are weak because we coddle them. **DO NOT CODDLE WOMEN.** Treat them equally, hold them to the same high standards that you hold men. This is how we create the change we want to see.

\&gt; there have been 5 women who have broken down and become a burden at some point

I thought about this overnight and tried to imagine what happens in a world where women are breaking down all of the time and attempted to imagine what could contribute to a gap where women are emotional messes and men are not. Then I remembered the suicide statistics I've seen linked here. Did you know that men commit suicide far more often than women do, and with much higher success rates per attempt? I think that there's something wrong with the world, and men and women are both suffering. The way they show that they suffer is different, though. Do you agree?

\&gt; ""you are the guy, you are supposed to handle the situation""

You were 16. There's no reason you should have been expected to handle a coworker's emotional breakdown. I'm sorry that toxic gender roles have hurt you. They've hurt me, too. When I was taking thermo in college, a man saw me studying at a gym pool and said something along the lines of, ""You shouldn't have to do that; a lady like you can get a guy to do that for her."" It's toxic, and it's part of why we're here now trying to make sense of all of the sickness that society has spewed into our minds.

\&gt;  Women get it with a cherry on top, men get it raw.

You know when you are slighted because you live that life. Have you been fired from a bar tending job because your recently divorced male manager doesn't like when old guys hit on you? I have. Have you persistently been told that your athletic achievements don't matter because a guy in a wig can beat you with no practice? I have. I live a life where, just because of the DNA I'm born with, I'm automatically weaker than the half of the population that has literal naturally produced steroids pumping through their heart. That is certainly a disadvantage. You mentioned construction work: I can never do that as well as you can, and it's not because I don't have intelligence or will. Do you know what it feels like to have a person 50-100 lbs heavier and who builds muscle 4x more easily become sexually aggressive towards you? I do, because it happens often and it's terrifying. I know that you take on burdens that I don't. I hope you know I'm not arguing that, but there are two sides to this coin. I wonder if you're able to think of any ways that women might be disadvantaged in our societal structure.

Back to your earlier post:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You are running a business, the intent of a business is to generate cash flow through profit.

I wonder if all of the business owners agree with you. Google seems to think that this the purpose of a business is this: ""The primary purpose of a business is to **maximize profits** for its owners or stakeholders while maintaining corporate **social responsibility**."" Again, we see two halves of a coin. It's almost shocking how you perfectly embody the first part and your boss perfectly embodies the second part.

\&gt; You understand the logic?

I do understand the logic, but I think your approach is over systematized and it's great that you have a boss who balances you out.

\&gt; Without the success of a business, we wouldn't have an income, which makes it reasonable to put the needs of the business before our own emotional desires.

Certainly. This is why they hired you- because your approach is valuable, literally.

\&gt; I skimmed through that article you posted, I didn't see anywhere that said that it had a positive effect on men. It mostly discusses the effects of feminism on women. Please clarify where it discusses the benefits that men received.

Sure, I will annotate the article here with you so that you can understand that while the article is female-focused, many of the benefits that women received also applied to men. I'll work about half way through the article to point out relevant parts from the pre-1960's.

\&gt; That period began with the creation of the Women’s Trade Union League (WTUL) in 1903. The League, as it was known by its members, drew together educated women reformers (mostly white, Protestant, and native-born) and young women workers (many of them immigrant Jews, Italians, and Irish) to **improve factory wages, working conditions, and hours.** The WTUL embodied both an unusual degree of collaboration between feminists and the labor movement, and the many tensions that arose from longstanding attempts to build lasting and productive relationships.

Here we see an improvement in lifestyle that didn't solely affect women.

\&gt;  Middle-class and affluent supporters of woman suffrage—including League activists, college students, and even wealthy socialites—saw these strikes as an opportunity to win working women to the cause. Forming what the press dubbed “mink brigades,” affluent supporters marched alongside young immigrant women on picket lines in a largely successful attempt to **reduce high rates of police brutality**.

Do we agree that the primary victims of police brutality are male? While the purpose of the feminists here is to keep women strikers safe, we can imagine that on this topic feminism may benefit men even more than it benefited women by bringing attention to the way police treat people.

\&gt;  Frances Perkins (the future U.S. Secretary of Labor under Franklin Roosevelt) of the National Consumers League and Pauline Newman (a former Triangle employee and WTUL activist) were appointed as investigators for the New York State Factory Investigating Commission (FIC), positions they used to **educate powerful politicians about the conditions under which working women labored**. Over the next three years, the New York FIC, and sister organizations in the other industrial states, pushed through a **dramatically expanded regulatory structure for factory labor—including laws that empowered state commissioners of labor, banned the labor of children under the age of fourteen, and required inspection of elevators and fireproof devices.**

"I personally don't think that women should be allowed to vote.  Apart from that they should be equal to men under every other aspect of the law.  When I say equal, I mean equal, no special perks or programs that support them for being female, they have to compete with men in every field if they want to be independent or to have a career, no divorce court, no affirmative action, no maternity leave, only very basic welfare where people are kept alive on donations and don't get any money from tax payers.  Single mothers don't get to buy an iPhone contract or fashionable clothes for their kids and themselves on other people's money.  They live in a shelter and eat from a soup kitchen.  I think women voting is even more of a problem than men who are uneducated having vote.

Instinctively women are generally looking for something to provide for them and give them provisions.  This ultimately creates a socialist government and a nanny state.  If a woman is genuinely competent enough to do anything outside of having children or homemaking she can compete with men on an equal playing field."

Perhaps, a better way to gain appreciation and a fan/customer base is changing how you display your art.

Most art fans want things relating to the things they are passionate about or an anime/manga/game/etc. that they are currently obsessed with.
Posting your art where people of those  demographics are helps gain you recognition. Posting on multiple popular apps/sites such as Twitter, Instagram, Deviantart, Facebook, and the like with applicable tags really helps make the process of people finding your art much easier.

Also, having an accessible portfolio and displaying that you are taking commissions/looking to sell your art helps a lot. People aren’t mind readers, so you really need to market it in a way that is clear."

I had a50’s for years. Man I loved them!! Recently sold them on ebay due to the battery going and to try the arctis wireless. First pair cracked where the ski band goes through within a week. They use a sort of brittle plastic on the cups and hinges that I just dont see holding up for years like my a50s. Sent them back and got replacements. They have a clearer high end than the a50 but are a little bass light. I have a big head and they honestly barely fit until I got some wicked cushion m50x pads which drastically increased the comfort and added a nice low end boost. The stock pads are crap. The dac box is much nicer than the a50 with the dual batteries and the ability to adjust eq and settings on the fly. Wish you could toggle 7.1 on and off on the headset itself though.  Music over bluetooth sounds really good especially with the new pads.  As far as the dts headphone:x it is a little more precise as far as directional audio (footsteps) goes but the astros have a better soundstage and surround effect.  Imo just a better sense if immersion. In a perfect world id have the arctis for fps games and astros for open workd gta type games lol. Something about them just didnt do it for me though. Mainly the lack of depth in the dts and my worries about them breaking again in the future. Sent them back and won an auction on a set of a50s gen3 with only 30 or so hours of use for 96 dollars!!! The second i put the astros on i remembered why i loved them so much. The 7.1 feels like a movie theatre in them lol.  So much more soundstage. My perfect headset would be a50’s with the arctis pro drivers in them and hooked up to the arctis dac box and the ability to toggle between dts and dolby. Honestly with ps5 coming sooner rather than later and dolby atmos support most likely built into it so you can use any headphones i wouldnt recommend buying a 300 dollar headset mainly for the 7.1 and wireless.  Just grab some used gen2 a50s off ebay for like 80 bucks or something similar imo.   If you do end up going for them or the arctis 7 I cant recommend wicked cushions m50x pads off amazon enough!! They drastically improve them!  Oh and also I didnt notice much if any background noise and the bluetooth volume rocker worked fine.

Things took a turn for the worse when she insisted that not only did they have to honor the expired coupon, but that since today was Wednesday the coupon in fact must be doubled.

In all seriousness though the best place to find current information on police activity as it's happening is going to be Twitter accounts from local news sources, or local agencies.

Cells in our body are made up of amazing tiny little machines called proteins. These proteins can do all sorts of wonderful things but one of the most important jobs is turning the foods we eat into energy. There are many ways to do this depending on what you are eating. Normally the cells in our brain prefer to use sugar to make energy but after using alcohol for a long time they rewire to make better use of alcohol for fuel. This would be like getting rid of a nuclear power plant in exchange for a coal plant. When doing this they reach a new ""homeostasis"" which is the balance between how many of each of these little machines they make. This can be measured using experiments and the researches found the difference by measuring the amount of protein in the brain between individuals who used alcohol heavily and those who did not. 

&amp;#x200B;

While this wasn't addressed in the article since the cells in the brain reached a new homeostasis favoring alcohol as an energy source it's possible to imagine the brain craving that for fuel making an individual want to use alcohol. I'm curious to read more about sugar cravings after stopping alcohol use, perhaps there is something interesting there as the cells want to switch back to another source of energy.

So I ran downstairs hoping to whatever almighty power that this thing leaves, and sure enough it did. But I got curious and went back to the roof. This time with feigned courage and balls. I reached my hand out to see what it'd do by making a few gestures. and well, it copied every one. I went to a different point on the roof and it changed its angle.

I didn’t approach a warlock in a super, I waited until I saw the tether connect and hit a damage marker. If the super behaved properly, the super would’ve ended and he would’ve remained tethered. 

Not a fucking thing in my post had anything to do with me dying, or me complaining I died. I never even mentioned it in the post.

The point of the post is the tether should have never been destroyed. A suppressed super shouldn’t get one last kill shot. It happens with suppression grenades as well. It’s either a bug, or a broken mechanic.  In no way was I bitching about dying. "

"Should be at the top.  Specifically:

&gt;We can debate the effects of too much CO2 in the atmosphere on climate. That doesn’t make CO2 a form of “pollution.”

What Max said is factually correct. CO2 is not a pollutant.  *Pollution* is an abnormal substance introduced into an environment with negative effects.  CO2 is not an abnormal substance, it's been in our environment since day 1 and will continue to be until the end of the world. 

Too much sugar causes diabetes, that doesn't make sugar a pollutant.

Too much rain causes floods, but rain is not a pollutant. 

Too much sun causes sunburn, but sunlight is not a pollutant. 

But that won't stop the circle-jerk from the left about how it's Max ""denying science"""

"Hi! It’s been really nice so far actually. I notice my skin has seemed really smooth since I started using it and with a soft texture, like a baby. Then I started using some other stuff off Amazon and I immediately broke out. So I went back to the Waso stuff and have had no issues since. If anything it seems to be inoffensive to my skin, and somewhat improves the texture without breaking it out."

"Yup, NDI is super easy. After watching some tutorials for the first time, i was able to get it working in a half hour. It's super easy. 

FX send is when signal is sent pre-fader, and AUX send sends the signal post fader. Meaning a signal either is processed by the effects processor on the board, or not. Pre-fader being not processed, post fader meaning it is. For what you're doing, I don't think there is too much of a difference.

"I’m not sure “free will” is the most accurate term, I would call it agency, which is a self aware function. Humans are self aware which means they have agency, which can be contrasted with convention or morality (although admittedly, people tend to get mad when I use the term morality in a negative light). Now, because we can execute our own agency, we can excel beyond our impulses, even at our own detriment. This is akin to why the abortion debate is futile; science gives us the ability to abort fetuses, therefore it’s more or less pointless to argue whether or not we *should* perform abortions. Once a technology or idea is uncovered, it changes the human condition. We are not simply a sum of our organic parts, we are a subject of the rational mind, the deists, from my perspective, worship the rational mind as God, but obviously religion is a ridiculous can of worms that I don’t care to parse apart, and is not in its modern form anything close to being rational.

"**Part 1**  


So this is a massive question. Regretfully, in some cases, we don't know how the religion was created, or why it was formed, as the religious stretches too far back and we don't have the sources. I'm thinking primarily Hinduism. But we do have ideas on others ones. I'll start with Christianity though, as we have a pretty good picture there. 

There have been a number of books written on the subject, but one of the most thorough texts on the subject was written by John Dominic Crossan, aptly titled, The Birth of Christianity. While his position has largely been accepted, it hasn't been without some challenge. Works such as From Jesus to Christ, by Paula Fredrickson and From Jesus to Christianity, by L Michael White have also added a great deal to the understanding of the formation of Christianity. 

One thing we must first do though is place Christianity in a historical context. Specifically, we have to place Jesus in a historical context. In the 1980s, what N.T. Wright has deemed the Third Quest for the Historical Jesus was beginning. Two important figures in this quest are Geza Vermes and E.P. Sanders. What these two authors did was place Jesus in his Jewish context. E.P. Sanders wrote Jesus and Judaism, while Vermes wrote a trilogy; Jesus the Jew, The Religion of Jesus the Jew, and Jesus in His Jewish Context. 

What these two authors demonstrated was that Jesus was Jewish, and that he had no intention on creating a new religion. More importantly, in order to understand Jesus, you had to understand the Judaism in which he was operating in, specifically, second Temple, Palestinian, Judaism. That argument has largely become a foundation for the studies on the origin of Christianity. 

As these two authors argue, Jesus never attempted to start a new religion, and was working within Judaism, and that is how he is best understood. They also help make sense of the idea of the resurrection (E.P. Sanders goes further in this regard with two other books, Paul and Palestinian Judaism; and Paul The Law and the Jewish People). Specifically, they look at the idea of a general resurrection which was present in some forms of Judaism at that time, such as Pharisaic Judaism, and what Sanders calls Common Judaism. This was the belief that at the end of time, or specifically when the Kingdom of God replaced the earthly Kingdom, there would be a general resurrection where Jewish people, and others, would be resurrected, and live in this new kingdom. The view was based on an understanding of justice. The idea was that God was a just god, and at some time, the Jewish people (and this stretched further as well) would receive justice for the turmoil that they felt on earth. 

The authors then argue that during the first century, what we begin seeing is basically a boiling point. We see quite a few revolts amongst the Jews (including the First Jewish Revolt that led to the destruction of the Temple), and we see a number of Messianic claimants rising up, and ultimately being shut down by Rome. This is the context Jesus is brought up in, and it greatly influenced his message. 

Now, John Dominic Crossan goes a bit further than this. One of the big ideas that Crossan introduces is the idea that Jesus was a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant (personally, I disagree with the idea that Jesus was a peasant, and Crossan has a number of opponents to the claim,  but the general idea is rather sound). 

Whether or not Jesus was a peasant isn't all that important here though. What Crossan does point out (in The Birth of Christianity) is that the Jewish homeland had been under pagan control for centuries. However, during the rule by Persians and the Greeks, only one revolt occurred, and that was over four hundred years. But in the 200 years that Rome controlled the area, there were three major revolts. Crossan argues that this was because during Roman rule, the Jewish population in Palestine, which was fairly poor and rural, were overly oppressed. With the idea of a divine justice coming, this nearly guaranteed a clash, and as I mentioned before, this was the environment Jesus was born in. 

So, Jesus, as these three authors show, was born in a time and place that was set for revolt. And Jesus enters into this environment with an apocalyptic or eschatological message about divine justice. That soon the Kingdom of God would replace the earthly kingdom (which was Rome). As the Gospels agree, the fate of Jesus was death as a criminal in the eyes of Rome. 

But even with the death of Jesus, Christianity isn't formed. As Vermes and Sanders pointed out, the idea of resurrection wasn't all that unique. It was an idea within Judaism, and it was attached to the general resurrection. Now most scholars will argue that Jesus wasn't really resurrected. Crossan, in ""The Historical Jesus,"" argues that Jesus was probably buried in a shallow grave and eaten by dogs. But, the idea that Jesus had been resurrected was being spread. Yet, again, this was within a Jewish context. 

So we have two aspects here now. Fredriksen, in From Jesus to Christ, points out a very important aspect. The Jesus movement continues after the death of Jesus, and who takes this up is his brother, James, along with Peter and John (two former disciples). This group is called the Pillars, and they are at the center of the Jerusalem sect. This is still a Jewish mission, and they are operating within Jewish ideas. However, we have other individuals coming in as well, and they start spreading the message to Gentiles. One of the obvious individuals is Paul.

"Classroom management is very difficult to learn. I think you're doing fine, you're learning, it's a process. Nobody is going to do well with their first class. 

Consistency and Control are key. Be firm, but fair.

You followed through on a consequence you set. At times we say things we really don't want to follow through on, but it's worse if you don't.

If you able to address a behavior with as little confrontation, this should be the route. If it can be fixed with a look, or standing next to them, that is always best. Even leaning down and whispering to them is preferable to calling them out.

Even how you phrase the correction can work wonders ""hey, I just saw you working really hard, let's get back to that"" (even if that's a bold faced lie) with a smile works better than a ""get back to work"" any day. Now if they are disrespectful to this, that is when you get down to their level and whisper to them ""this is your warning, if you continue you will have X consequence""

Management is difficult. The way you described it, I don't think what you did was ""fair"" but it should still have been enforced. To not back you on this, makes you lose authority. It should have been a private conversation afterwards. "

"OK, then I guess it's fair to say that when Barack Obama criticized the police and claimed they had systemic problems with racism, that incited some guy in Dallas to murder a bunch of cops three years ago, or when Bernie Sanders criticized the GOP, calling them a threat to American democracy, calling them barbaric, claiming they're trying to kill thousands of Americans to give tax breaks to the rich, that incited one of his supporters to shoot a bunch of Republican politicians at a ballpark. Oh wait, I can't help to notice that none of these people actually told their supporters to go out and kill people. Did Trump tell anyone to send a bomb to a CNN office? No, he didn't. Yes Trump has been criticizing CNN and more generally our entire mainstream media, and rightfully so, because they're essentially the propaganda arm for the Democratic Party, who, talk about criticism, have been implying their political opponents are pure evil and slowly ramping up these hysterics for the past two decades. Yet when some psychopath goes off the rails and attacks a Republican, I know that the blame lies on that psychopath, not on Jimmy Kimmel, not on Don Lemon, not on Elizabeth Warren. This is common sense, and if you blame Trump for some psycho sending bombs in the mail you're engaging in a ridiculous double standard. "

"&gt; However the fact that some of those games were against swf (or just decently coordinated survivors) and the killer only got 1 or maybe even 0 kills, is considered unacceptable and means survivors are broken.

"I'm curious why you think TJP Blitz power base is ""pretty shaky"". You stated that the deck only has 25 power. It has 4 seek power as well and only needs to hit TJJP the entire game. Primal isn't necessarily needed before turn 4/5 either. My power base is certainly wrong because I played 8 combrei duals in theory to have more hands enable turn 2 student. However this can be similarly accomplished with having a variety of duals as seen in older lists from myself, LightsOutAce, Neon, etc. I've rarely had more powerscrew issues than other 3 faction decks.

Do you think Haunted Highways power base is as shaky or shakier since they don't play seeks and have more depleted power? I know you avoided talking about the deck much given its been heavily written about already this week.

Overall an excellent article and a great change of pace from the usual top 8 only discussions."

We do test freshies (of course) and transfers from non-WFTDA leagues (we have a local one that definitely does not enforce minimum skills).

"As others have said, you have to make changes for yourself and with no expectation of reuniting with your ex.  Changing FOR someone else won’t stick.  It will work for a time, but until you want to change for yourself, you won’t be ready to do the hard work of changing yourself from the inside, and any change will only be temporary.  

It sounds like you carry some baggage, and that might contribute to how you deal with things.  It’s a good sign that you recognize a need for change, take responsibility for yourself and your actions,  and don’t hide behind, “but x, y, z is why!”.  That’s huge, actually.  Take the time to unpack your baggage, work on making living amends to yourself and others without expectation of anything in return, help others when you see they need help.  Take it one day at a time and recognize that you may take some steps forward, and some backward.   It’s about progress, not perfection.  As long as you are honest with yourself and take responsibility if you mess up, try to learn from it, and continue to try to do better, that’s what matters."

It seems you just cant get into the new school not that you cant understand that theyre unique artists. When you only listen to one kind of music and as you get older your brain becomes more rigid and less accepting to new sounds and music which is why old generation always dislikes the new generations music so it seems to be a case of unintentional close mindedness and you cant relate to their music which is fine no ones forcing you to like anyone I just think you should separate artistic merit from personal preference. Just because you dont like Young Thugs or Travis music doesnt mean you cant recognize they were innovators that influenced this generation of music significantly.

ill say what like about the rolex is the inky black dial, which the sinn might have too.  the rolex has some polished surfaces like the sides and the bezel.  these polished parts and the white gold hands and other parts on the dial are really cool and make it pop a little while still flying under the radar.  gives it some charm and character where as the sinn is a bit sterile in comparison. the bracelet is comfortable and i just love the watch overall.

it was expensive, and had some buyers remorse at first.  i think part of it was getting used to the smaller size, although i did prefer it to the 214270 which seemed bulky, but it has really grown on me.

i have always really liked the 556i too.  if something were to happen to my explorer that would be on my shortlist for sure."

"Yeah, so don't worry about Delta/United I haven't had any issues with them. I think it's because they're US based and I'm pretty sure they aren't allowed to ask about medical stuff. 

So, first call your OB and check if they will provide the certificate without being seen, or if you need an appointment to get the certificate. I had to have an appointment, so my advice stems from that. I would print out the requested information and take it with you to your doctor's appointment, along with all the answers that you know (like the first 3 points). I mean the doctors know it, but it just makes it easier on them if you already have it listed. Make sure you specify to the doctor that you need a ""medical certificate"", they will know what it is. It says to have the certificate provided ""within 10 days"" on the website, but I would do it at least 2 business days before the flight so you can get a confirmation from their medical department that you are approved to fly.

You will also want to call Cathay and ask where it needs to be sent, since I don't see that information provided on their website. China Air didn't provide it either, which is super annoying. Like why provide all the stuff they want and not where it should be sent?! Also, just double check that the certificate can be provided in English (although it is a Hong Kong airline so I would assume that would be ok).

"For transmasculine people, erections are possible but only 'on demand', as far as I'm aware the most common method includes putting a little pump with fluid in the balls, which can be used to fill up parts of the Penis to give it an erection.

But the TL;DR is that involuntary erections don't happen.

Women don't work in exclusive circles of only women. Improvement of working conditions helps all of the workers.

\&gt;  Perkins oversaw the extension of wage-and-hour and safety protections for all workers, regardless of gender, through the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938. **These laws marked a turning point for union men who had long been ambivalent toward the idea of legislating labor conditions.** ***No longer were strategies for improving the lives of workers so starkly divided by sex.***

Here we see the article directly addresses the effects of feminism on male workers. I hope it's not necessary for me to continue annotating to prove my point.

\&gt; As far as I can tell, men are now working in an environment where they walk on eggshells all day long.

I'm sorry.

\&gt; You can't seriously be attributing the improvement of specific working conditions to feminism. You do know that the first union was made in 1810, right?

I am suggesting that feminism contributed to improved working conditions, as the article details. I'm not saying that men didn't do anything for themselves. Don't make a strawman out of my argument.

\&gt; the company should be able to fire her because she is behaving unprofessional and she is illustrating that she cannot handle the job that she is getting paid to do.

100% agree. No one should be manipulating on the regular to get coworkers picking up slack. I have so little experience with women using crying to get out of work duties that I still don't even know how to respond to this.

Again, thanks for taking the time to defend your view points. It's a pleasure to sharpen my mind with other sharp minds. :)"

"na na na na na na na na Bat Cave!

I actually made a comment about guano a few days on the minecraft suggestions board.  I've been thinking about how it could work in game.  I've seen mods that add poop.  It basically just looks like the emoji and you pick it up.  I don't think guano should work that way.  Here is what I know from seeing videos/shows on bats...

There are some very large colonies.  One video I watched showed a huge colonie flying out.  The guy filming thought it was sprinkling... it wasn't... it was small amounts of bat poop from thousands and thousands of bats.  (blech).  Anyway, my point is that where he was outside the cave there really was just a sprinkling of poo.  It wasn't accumulating.  It shouldn't be something were every now and then you find a piece of bat poo.  Where you find the guano is in the cave on the floor.  It takes lots of bats a long time to build up layers of guano on the floor.

Layers, I think, is the key.  There should be caves with lots of bats.  Maybe the grass just outside the cave could be a bit greener with more tall grass.  Inside the cave guano should accumulate under where they sleep in layers... like the worst snow you've ever seen!  It would accumulate over time as long as you didn't kill the bats.  You did it up with a shovel.  It gets deeper over time too (as long as the block is kept loaded.)  You are right, it's top notch fertilizer.  I like the idea of being able to use it for gunpowder too.

How many bats?  I'm guessing there should be a couple dozen bats per cave at least, although if there was a way to make it so there were lots more without creating a lot of lag that would be even cooler... maybe there could be a mix of 'real' bats that have AI and some bats on the ceiling that are just sort of animated sprites that disappear with the colony when it flies out for the night.

More about guano...  nasty stuff lives in guano... people who harvest it go in carefully.  There is flesh eating bacteria in the piles as well as giant centipedes.  Harvesting it by hand (that is, without a shovel and at least boots should make you sick.)  Giant centipedes could attack you.  Giant could be relative to the size of the cave.  You could have 'small' ones the size of silverfish crawling around the cave or big ones the size of small animals (maybe even up to pig sized?  This is fantasy after all.)"

"Few problems, one  is modern roadways are Asphalt. Two, this material also has to meet certain ATTI, MAGG, ASHTO, &amp; ASTM specs before it can be put to use on a public access. While this is a cool idea in theory, structurally there are several issues. That water doesn’t just go into the ground and magic presto it’s gone. Those rocks and pebbles they are speaking of is actually what’s called ABC. It’s a specifically designed material, designed to hold a certain amount of moisture. The soil beneath that ABC material is also specifically designed to hold a very specific amount of water and maintain a very specific amount of density, in order for it to support a specific amount of weight, equal to or greater than the weight of the traffic that will be on the roadway itself. If more water than what both of those materials are designed to hold makes it into that material beneath the roadway, it can start causing several issues. Issues like, heaving, washout, cracking, rising, basically it turns to shit.

"Senior living is very expensive if there is any medical incolvement at all. Assisted living in my area can be 4k a month for a shoebox studio apartment in a bad place. 7k a month for a one bedroom in a good place.

"You made a poor decision that you regret, but you don't have to let that decision define you for the rest of your life. You sound like you have more than what it takes to pass Ranger School physically. However, it's the mental aspect that really matters. No single task you do in Ranger School is hard; however things that should be easy become much harder when you are starving, wet, cold, and rolling on 2 hours sleep... with 40 other dudes (and dudetts now) that are equally as miserable. At the point, it really just becomes about not quitting no matter what they throw at you, and just accepting that you will be there as long as it takes. And also not being a douchebag to your squad/platoon. 

In regards to the ""technical"" stuff,  The Ranger School Cadre will teach you exactly how they want to see an OPORD / Raid / Patrol Base Activities, and you will practice it... over and over again. If you have too you can literally just keep your Ranger Handbook open for the entire patrol. "

"I think that it's important to remember the context of Te Tiriti when we talk about it, particularly in regard to unity. We should remember that at the time of the signing Māori were much more powerful in New Zealand than Pākehā. Therefore the offer of unity was an elevation of Pākehā to a status they did not deserve in relation to their military power and population in New Zealand at the time. I think that if Te Tiriti is viewed this way then it's quite obvious what it's implications are today in regard to Māori as an out numbered and oppressed people... unity? The HP moves away from any unity sought by Te Tiriti and is just a gerrymandering tool, which is what Māori seats originally were. Now that Māori seats actually hold power, the same type of people wish to remove said power."

We didn't use protection, and this was definitely a one night stand sort of thing, and I mentioned something about it, and she, without missing a beat
said ""Don't worry about it, how else do you think I'm gonna get a passport?"". Then she immediately stopped and looked at me, with a ""what the fuck did I just say"" look on her face. 

We stood, naked, in silence, for a few seconds, and then then both burst out laughing hysterically...  I mean the sheer ballsiness of making that joke, to a guy you haven't know that long, and just slept with for the first time.  Fucking hilarious.  We were together for a few years after that."

Now, if she's drunk, she can't consent to sex in many jurisdictions, legally, so that's off the table in this case, obviously.  However, cuddling is definitely warranted.  If she doesn't want me to cuddle her, then she shouldn't be in my bed, regardless of how much she trusts me.

Or going east or west 18th across Chambers. The people zipping up the inside are just trying to cut the line. The right hand lanes should be for turning only.

"**Part 2**

I will come back to the Jerusalem sect in a moment, but there is something important about Paul that has to be mentioned. Pamela Eisenbaum, in her book, Paul was not a Christian, continues an idea that developed in the New Perspective of Paul school of thought (James D.G. Dunn is one of the big figures in this, and has a book called the New Perspective on Paul), that Paul was Jewish. He never converted, he continued practicing Judaism, and he was operating within the confines of Judaism (or at least a confine of Judaism). In particular, Eisenbaum argues that Paul's view, and his want to spread the gospel of Jesus is based on his Jewish background. She argues that Paul sees himself in the line of the prophet of Jeremiah, who spoke that at the end, every knee will bow down before God, and join together. 

One of the views that both Eisenbaum and Dunn argue is that Paul saw himself at the end of time. He believed that the Kingdom of God was just around the corner, and thus the message had to be spread as far as possible. For Paul, Jesus represented the first fruits of the general resurrection, as in, Jesus signified that the general resurrection had already begun. Dunn points out that this view was so prevalent among some of those in the Jesus movement that Paul even has to argue that they hadn't been resurrected yet. 

So Paul saw himself as operating within Judaism. Going back to the Jerusalem sect, what Donald Harman Akenson argues in Saint Saul: A Skeleton Key to the Historical Jesus, is that the Jerusalem sect approved of Paul's mission, and that Paul himself submitted to their authority. L. Michael White, in From Jesus to Christianity, expands on this that Paul had to walk a fine line. His message was approved by the Jerusalem sect, but that approval could be rescinded. And as part of his approval, he had to also take up a collection for the Jerusalem sect. So even the Jerusalem sect, that was fully Jewish, saw what Paul was doing as part of acceptable Judaism. Now, there was some debates within this early movement, but as Dunn argues, Paul was largely responding to the issues that were arising. They were in new territory, and much of the work at that time was reactive. 

Throughout all of this time, the Jesus movement continued to fall under Judaism. And it wasn't all that far from what was happening in Judaism during that time period. Going back to Sanders and Vermes, they point out an interesting point. That during the first century (and before that), there was a group of individuals who largely followed Judaism, but didn't convert. Often this meant that they just didn't commit to circumcision, but other times it meant that they only followed portions of Judaism. In literature now, they are often called God-fearers. So at this time, there was already gentiles who followed a Jewish message, but were still on the outside as they didn't convert. The Jesus movement operated within that group as well. 

Now, what caused Judaism and the Jesus mission to split way, and for Christianity to be formed? White, in From Jesus to Christianity argues that it was the First Jewish Revolt, or the First Jewish War, that ended with the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Before that, there were many forms of Judaism, and there was interfaith debate. That was normal. But with the destruction of the Temple, Judaism would forever be changed. Out of that carnage, only two forms of Judaism would surface, that which became Rabbinic Judaism (descending from the Pharisees) and Christianity (descending from the Jesus movement). Without the Temple, the Sadducees were gone as they centered around the Temple, and the Essenes were wiped out in the fighting. 

The split wasn't complete at this time though. What White argues is that a wedge had been placed, and the split was occurring. During this period, what would become Rabbinic Judaism was focused on consolidating the religion in order for it to survive, and what would become Christianity was opposed to that. What really drove that wedge further, and completed that split was the Second Jewish War. White argues that Christians really didn't support the Jewish movement here, as it was largely centered around a different messianic claimant. Rabbinical Judaism saw this as traitorous. And by then, Christianity was largely its own religion, outside of Judaism. 

However, as Bart Ehrman points out in Lost Christianities, Jewish-Christian groups still existed into the fourth century. And really, going up to that point, we see a whole realm of different Christian sects that had very different views. But moving towards the fourth century, Christianity did what Judaism had done at the end of the first century, and into the second century, consolidated. Ehrman, in a lecture called From Jesus to Constantine (available through the Great Courses) mentions that part of what happens is that with the spread of Christianity, it begins forming a larger percentage of the population. By the time of Constantine, it was large enough that it became advantageous to become officially more accepting. However, because Christianity was so diverse, there was a need to at least, on paper, get an ""orthodox"" view. This didn't stop any of the arguments, but it gave an official position to many of the arguments going on (again, the debates continued just the same before and after the Council of Nicaea). However, by creating an official view, it was a way to begin to consolidate the religion.   


So really, Christianity was can largely be seen as just forming because the environment was just right for it. The early movement wasn't seeking to create a new religion, it was operating under Judaism, but two Jewish Revolts, and the aftermath of those, would change the landscape dramatically, and out of that, we get Rabbinical Judaism and Christianity. 

I know that was a bit long, but I can also go into the origins of Judaism next if you'd want. "

"So I live in an area where horseback riding is not very easy or common (NYC). But I was lucky to find a stable accessible by public transportation, and I started riding there this summer. The first few lessons I had were a half-hour each and seriously sucked—like, I learned nothing, I was probably on horseback for fifteen minutes, tops. And the instructors were a little condescending. But I thought, hey, maybe this is kind of like hazing? Maybe you have to suck it up for a few lessons, persevere, and eventually they’ll start treating you like you aren’t just there to give them money and waste their time? 


So I kept going. I didn’t really have a choice, considering this place is an hour commute away from me and still the closest/most accessible stable by far. I had a weekly riding lesson there all summer and purchased hour-long lesson packages 5 lessons at a time. But instead of improving, the quality of instruction honestly just deteriorated, to the point where at my last lesson (this Saturday), the instructor had a friend meander over to the ring and the two of them just talked and laughed with each other while I trotted serpentines for an hour. Every so often one of them would call out some instruction but it was seriously like..what the hell? This is not nice or professional. I am a crappy rider but I’m seriously trying to improve, and ngl even the half-assed instruction helps me a lot. Doesn’t make it feel any less disrespectful and annoying though. 


Ok, so here’s the worst part, the true temper tantrum: When I finish my lesson, I untack the horse in his stall, groom him, give him a nice cuddle and a mint, all the cringey horse girl stuff. I’m feeling like, eh, the instruction sucks and the lessons are expensive, but anything for horses, right? The horses make it worth it. 


Anyway, I go back to the office and try to schedule lessons. I keep getting told “oh we’re booked that weekend, we’re booked that weekend,” and finally, I start throwing out dates for next month and the month after that. Finally, this woman says to me, “We’re booked every weekend until June. You can call on Thursdays and Fridays to see if there’s a last-minute cancellation.” Evidently, they don’t just sell lessons in 5-hour blocks—they had an enrollment period in August where people signed up for the entire school year. And what I don’t understand is how I rode there all summer and *no one* mentioned this was something I could do. This place was just so unwelcoming and crappy the whole time I rode there...I can’t fucking believe how much time I spent trying to make it work. I mean, at the end of the day, it was obviously not a great place to ride. But damn it, I just miss horses and I’m really bent up about it. "

"I had this to say on another video regarding In N Out vs Whataburger.

1. In N Out great price for just the double double burger

2. In N Out fries suck, like really they are not worth paying the combo price for. Animal style makes it a bit better but it's like going from a 2 to a 4 on a 10 scale..they are that bad.

3. The size of the In N Out burger pales in comparison with Whataburger's.

4. Generic ketchup, after having Whatburger's nothing feels the same, Whataburger's spicy ketchup just widens the gap.

5. The lack of variety is just well not that appealing for In N Out, I can go to Whataburger and get an original double burger one week, get a chicken sandwich the next week cough though Chick-Fil-A is first choice cough, or get any of the all time favorites any time. There are just so many different styles.

6. Not open 24hrs, where am I going to get a good meal after a good night out??? I know I know, Bistec Tacos or as Californians call them ""Asada Tacos"" are always the 1# choice..just wanted to add another point.

In my opinion tourism/novelty is what keeps In N Out packed. I have got to give them props for that, name alone keeps them going. Also, if they had Whataburger's menu they would not be able to accommodate for all their customers, it would just be too much customization.  ﻿"

Society is civil and free.  

The one thing I have to say.. if you're in upper management or high end IT in India, the amount you earn puts you in the top 5%, and that gives you some luxuries you won't get anywhere in the world. You'll live like a king in India. You can't expect the same abroad. Personally, I used to earn 30+ LPA per year, but I was still happy moving abroad.

So what you are saying is that someone told him that these remains had been returned THAT DAY and also gave him the wrong number?

At what point does he have the responsibility to fact check these things?

Did you also hear about when Trump said that General Pershing told his Soldiers to dip their bullets in pig's blood to use on Muslims? But pretty much every historian has said there is no evidence of that happening? As I asked before, what responsibility does the President have to fact check these things?"

I'll keep it as short and sweet as possible, but the idea is that my hunter became overly ambitious while training with Eris Morn after the events of TTK and delved in to hive lore to try and learn about The Darkness. After his initial meeting with The Drifter he earned his way through the ranks of Gambit showing little remorse for the guardians he defeated. This was all in an attempt to gain favor from The Drifter in order to become a full on Shadow of Yor.

Saw it a lot with the women-as-brand-identity commentators during the 2016 primary, when people would try to tag Bernie supporters as being also bearded hipsters or vegans or whatever.

The same tendency is why you see so much trashy clickbait in the mainstream liberal press talking about Obama and Game of Thrones or How Trump Is Grindelwald or whatever. Can’t separate aesthetics from political stance or unrelated things from their similar opinions about them."

Sorry to hear you're not finding poetry groups. Some are pretty underground. But they're there.

Poetry doesn't change the world for ages? Byron would bet to differ. So does anyone who worked on the Bible or Quoran or Talmud, which consists of a lot of very old poetry. Look around, poetry and it's impacts are everywhere if you are open to seeing it.

So, what's obvious to me is that YOU have not experienced anything positive with poetry, thus no one does. Poetry is very much alive. Your experience isn't the reality for millions around the world."
"Today marks about 10 months of very consistent gym going with really high intensity and volume + eating a ton. 

Really started to see results about 5 months in, and still seeing nice gains pretty consistently. Gained about 7-10 lbs (depending on how much food is in my belly) and gotten a little leaner too because my abs are looking sharper than ever.

Friends keep telling me I'm looking bigger, made new friends from the gym, and solidified other friendships by lifting together.

Feels good.

Also recently moved (about a month and half) to a more social area of town where I have more friends and I've honestly never had a better social life. Going out every weekend day, some weekdays, and feeling the happiest I've ever been.


Regular lifting and making gains has become a philosophical pursuit for me, as pretentious as it sounds: it is one of the few methods of long-lasting self-improvement, it's mostly healthy for you, and it involves constant daily mild suffering. Surprised the transhumanist/LessWrong community hasn't embraced fitness more, because it is about as close to transhumanist philosophy of upgrading your crail human body as it is possible to approach with current technology.

Highly recommend a consistent, intense, high-volume lifting program + food. 

Mood has been very good recently too, even when I'm hungover after a fun weekend-- yeah I don't feel physically great, but the constant social buzz just kind of carries me through. 

Lifting + social life + regular sleep=cheat!mode for happiness."

"That's a compassionate perspective, but regardless, you're talking about putting your boyfriend's needs ahead of this hypothetical child. No, it's not fair that he may have a child but not be ready for it. It's not fair for you either. If you have the kid, however, both of you will need to grow up and do what's best for it - not just you. 

You don't know what the future holds. He may be  a shitty dad who sticks around, or he may be a great one. He may be a shitty absentee dad or a wonderful part time parent. He may even be the kinda guy who decides he needs to sue for custody, full or part. But one thing that is certain: your child will do better with the support of two parents than one, even if all your boyfriend can manage is financial support.

Don't fool yourself into thinking you'll be doing this entirely alone, so your choice only affects you and future baby. If you have a child, your boyfriend's life will change, too. No, you shouldn't make this choice for his benefit - but you should definitely consider that he may be a part of your life forever, willingly or unwillingly, if you do this."

"I feel the same way about my partner. when I met him, he had a stocky build and just a bit of subcutaneous fat; kind of a lumberjack type but otherwise fit. he had shoulder-length hair and kept his facial hair in a well-managed scruff or shaved it completely.

He gained about 60 pounds over the course of about 2 years, he stopped shaving as much (shaves when I ask him to or when he knows he's going to have a nice evening with me but no other time), as well as cutting his hair so now it's in that awkward chin-length stage you see hipster bands from the 2000s wearing. He also got put on Prozac which had some honestly very difficult effects on our sex life (a bit TMI so I'll spare the details). lastly, we met when I was 18 and he was 17. we were very much alike. but now we're both 21 and as I have matured as a person sometimes it feels like he still has a lot of those 17-year-old traits. sometimes he'll do or say something and I'll cringe because it's immature. we used to baby-talk a lot to each other early in the relationship. I stopped, because I got sick of it. he still does it. I find it irritating now even though it used to be cute.

I still love him and I don't ever want to hurt him. if we did move in together, he'd make an ideal roommate, best friend, and confidant. he's never done anything to hurt or disrespect me and he's a kind and gentle person, kinder and more gentle than I am. I've almost never seen him get angry, especially not at me. annoyed, maybe, but never angry. but the sexual part of the way I love him is all but gone. I don't find sex with him gratifying. I find myself attracted to other people and wishing I could be with them, though I would never in a million years cheat on him because I value and respect him too much as a person to do that. I've considered asking if he'd be up for an open relationship, but I don't think he would be given that he's expressed how he doesn't feel the same as some of our friends in poly relationships do and couldn't be with more than one person. 

I feel like an asshole for not wanting to be with him sexually anymore; I feel shallow and vain. I feel like to break up with him over it would be to squander an otherwise wonderful relationship that has been going for 3 years. but I also feel like a piece of shit for staying, for ""faking,"" pretending to have orgasms when I'm not really having them, for telling him he's sexy when I don't really think he is anymore. sometimes I wonder if it would be better to just break it off. but he's also started to lose weight again lately, and he's started to mature as a person a little - he's finally starting to advance his career, and he has a full-time tutoring job now. maybe he'll get better if I just give him a chance, maybe he's just had a bad year. maybe I've just had a bad year - a lot of things have been going on in my own life too, I won't ignore that.

idk what to do."

However, you appear to lack an interest in facts and are quick to appeal to emotion.

For describing an event, and asking you to confirm whether you agree or disagree with that description.

A constructive critic might say ""no, what you described there gets the following facts wrong X, Y, Z, in fact what really happened is _____, you can verify this by ______""  [edit: not sure why it's adding bold, but I can't be bothered to reverse-engineer reddit]

https://money.cnn.com/2014/05/22/technology/security/nsa-obama-blackberry/index.html

&gt; In response to Obama's request, the NSA set up a lab where dozens of experts performed surgery for several months on a high-profile patient: the soon-to-be presidential BlackBerry. The course of treatment was to manipulate the device's innards to weed out potential threats to secure communication.

&gt; According to George, the president simply wanted a phone that enabled him to communicate with his advisers. Though the president was a well known BlackBerry (BBRY) addict at the time, the choice of smartphone model was the NSA's, not Obama's, George explained.

Not like Obama and his blackberry. That followed procedure."

&gt; 
&gt; Ante una pregunta en el programa radial Página Abierta, sobre si habrá Primarias en el peronismo ""con todos adentro"", Pichetto afirmó: ""**El kirchnerismo tiene otro partido**. **Si quieren estar en las PASO del PJ que se desafilien todos de Unidad Ciudadana y que ese partido no exista más**"".
&gt; 
&gt; Refiriéndose a [**Cristina Kirchner**](https://www.elintransigente.com/noticias/buscar/?buscar=cristina+kirchner) y a La Cámpora, pero sin nombrarlos, el jefe de la bancada del Peronismo Federal en la Cámara Alta consideró viable una gran interna pero señaló: ""Si uno arma un partido con orientación de izquierda está bien **pero es distinto al PJ**. No es una cuestión personal. No agravio ni hablo mal del otro. Armaron un partido y está bien si quieren expresar el centroizquierda. **Pero el peronismo no es centroizquierda ni izquierda dura**. El concepto de unidad es loable pero tiene que haber un marco de unidad sino mirá lo que pasa en el gobierno (de Cambiemos)"".
&gt; 
&gt; Sobre la ruptura del bloque del Frente Renovador en Diputados, promovido principalmente por Felipe Solá y Facundo Moyano, Pichetto aseguró que ""**no es sorpresivo**"". Aunque evitó ahondar en el tema: ""No quiero hacer más comentarios. Vamos a ver cómo funciona (eso)"".
&gt; 
&gt; Pichetto confirma día a día la posibilidad de que todo el arco peronista participe de una misma interna. ""Estamos buscando una opción. **Repetir el mismo escenario de 2015 (por la polarización entre el macrismo y kirchnerismo) no es bueno**. No genera buenas expectativas y consolida lo que se plantea como la brecha. **El Peronismo es un partido de centro,** que puede tener aliados en los partidos provinciales que entienden se puede construir un camino alternativo"", resaltó.

A bit slow today
"I would've, but I was leveling up guns for xp/attachments. Thank you for the suggestion though."
"&gt;I would like a system that allows varying degrees of power according to how much Refresh you invest, possibly with a skill used only to cast (I'll probably need 4, 1 for every tradition), and then, instead of a thousand different spells, something like super powers to allow various effects from the same conceptual core. I'd also need a stress track that gets depleted with the biggest castings, and some limits to avoid every single wizard to try lightning bolts and divinations and flying and counterspells even as a novice.

So, I think you're coming at it from the wrong end. You're thinking mechanics-first, because you're trying to emulate Pathfinder.

I propose an alternative: do the Fate Thing^tm and come at the problem fiction first. What should magic *feel* like in Golarion? What should it be able to achieve? How do people react to it? How difficult and rare is it?

Answering that question first should give you some directional guidance for how to build appropriate mechanics. If magic is supposed to be subtle, mysterious and powerful like Lord of the Rings, a more character-resource-intensive system might be called for. If it's supposed to be broad, common and accessible like Eberron, a lighter system may be more appropriate.

One caution I will give, though: avoid a ""Magic"" skill unless your magic is *extremely* limited in application or use. Don't create one ""super-skill"" that replicates the effects of (and therefore replaces) a bunch of other skills."
"Why is it that when the Jazz play us they're like the Monstars on crack, but against other opponents they're like a normal team? "
"From my perspective, if classical theism is basically just philosophical pondering, then it just another system that changes with the winds.

If God directly communicated with humans, then that would be the best way to know who God is and what He is about, and those beliefs shouldn't change regardless of the shifting philosophical landscape. That would be classified as a religion though according to today's definition."
I'm glad you're keeping track 😘
"Alright. So yeah, basically the idea I had last night when I was kind of crossfaded was; wow, I really can't just ""get away with"" anything. Even things you know you did that haven't ""come back to you"" yet, you remember. They've at least had an effect on the formation of your consciousness and thoughts.

Well, I only stole like $20 worth of stuff that time, but yeah, I only ever received a letter in the mail from a company they employed, asking me to pay like $300 ""restitution"" or something. A pretty fair trade, all said. Don't get me wrong though, I meant it when I said I've never stolen again since that event. Besides the two eggs I stole two days ago. That... was silly.

Well, I just started hormones like 6 months ago, but since then I've been so much for expressive, effusive even, I suppose? I also feel rather lonely since my fiance broke up with me and my girlfriend moved to college. Hence the having asked a girl out this week at work, and I asked my girlfriend's partner out last weekend (luckily, I think this proposal will go better). I guess thanks to hormones letting me express myself more, I know a little bit better what I want for my future. That is, ideally I have a job or whatever where I'm friends with everyone, and they care somewhat. Or, a job where I'm alone all the time to indulge in my usual introverted pastimes. I think transitioning is helping because I feel more and more like I'm able to express myself as time goes on, and because I'm getting to practice being myself, I can learn from myself. If that makes any sense. Gotta do the thing you wanna get better at to get better at it, right? 

Perhaps it's too soon to say how medical transition has affected my life in the grander sense, but personally, I'm happier, I think. Like I said, starting antidepressants now. Maybe I could try answering a more specific question relevant to your last question there. "

"&gt;Take driving a car for example.

Okay.

&gt;Now you might say that there are autonomous cars like Tesla, which didn't exist 50 years ago...

Sure, but I’d be more inclined to point out that around 150 years ago, *cars didn’t exist at all*. 

There’s a scale issue here. It seems that when you’re looking at *time*, you’re using an relatively narrow window, which makes you blind to the sheer amount of change that’s happening.

&gt;...but can you tell me what their difference is regarding their main function? You can't, because a car was only made to bring you from one point to another. 

Here we have the opposite scale issue. When you talk about time you’re narrow, but when you talk about “change” you’re incredibly broad.

It could read as if the argument you’re aiming for here that many living creatures have a need to *move* and always have, and that means nothing changes, regardless of the methods they may devise of movement. You might as well say that the change from flagella to legs isn’t a change either, at which point the claim becomes kinda meaningless because...what could you possibly be expecting?

If the move from horses to automobiles that drive themselves in a little over a century isn’t “change” to you, then what *is*?

&gt;Religions have changed because you can't expect people from the 21st century to just believe what was written in a book thousands of years ago.

Good, then we both disagree with your initial post. Now what?

&gt;How should all of it apply to it us anyway? 

All of what? The Bible? It shouldn’t. It’s meaningless.

&gt;Religion is not a physical law - it's not a constant that can be changed. It's not like the speed of light, rather it only has value because people give it value.

I don’t even know what you’re talking about anymore.

To repeat the point of my first comment, nearly *everything* is changing almost *constantly* and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous."

"I speak of particularly old Canadian Pacific Railway lines near my hometown. The tracks in many locations had no railway spikes (people collected them) and had come apart in several places. Visiting the tracks was a local hobby for people who collected things like insulators and CP Rail memorabilia (eg, padlocks), which could sometimes be found rusting alongside the tracks. Concrete barricades crossed the tracks in several places, making it very clear that no train was going to use them.

It was probably private property, I don't know. If so, there was no enforcement, and locals used the tracks (probably still do) for walking, sightseeing, etc. They pass through some interesting landscapes.

You still think we should expect a train to come barreling down that?

Zero tolerance policies are almost never perfect. Everything must be judged on a case-by-case basis.

I never did photograph any of those sites, but I would feel perfectly safe doing so. If a train tries going down them, it's going to derail.

[Not my photo, and opposite side of the country, but this is how I remembered the tracks being in my childhoold](http://www.erichall.eu/images/1410/1410008.jpg)

&gt; To me there is no such thing as a safe track photo, because even if you are being safe, the people who emulate you won't be.

If people are so stupid that they see a photo of a train track with big missing pieces and decide to go take photos of an intact, possibly active one, that's nobody's fault but their own. Imagine a world where everything is censored to safeguard the intensely foolish. It would be a shitty world."

"From Marc Maron's podcast where Marc and John Cleese swapped their favourite Jewish jokes:

Marc's Joke

""A Jewish man and his son are walking on the beach when out of nowhere a giant freak wave crashes on the beach and washes the son away. After desperately searching for his son, the Jewish man looks to the sky and says ""Please God, I know I haven't always been a good Jew, but if you return my son to me, I'll pray every day, I'll do whatever it takes. Please God!"" and as the words leave his lips, another freak wave sweeps in and deposits his son, soaking and sputtering, but very alive on the beach. The man looks at his son, and then looks back up at the sky and says ""When he went in he had a hat on.""
