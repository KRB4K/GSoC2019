"Playing a corrupt system for the benefit of the people makes you a renegade. But by removing the institutional knowledge of those trying to fix it, you only ensure that corrupt system will stay in place.

Do not forget the reason it's so corrupt: The economics of the political system. In single choice voting, you end up with two parties. When you have a duopoly, the cost of acquiring customers rises exponentially. Both sides are spending increasing amounts to convince a declining numbers of ""swing voters"" to their side. That money needs to come from *somewhere*.

What's needed is: A constitutional amendment which moves to instant runoff voting. Voters rank each candidate in terms of preference. You no longer have a single choice, you now have multiple choices. This changes the economics. Now ""3rd parties"" get a bigger share of the pie. Now politicians have to appeal to the masses instead of just the swing voters. Wedge issues don't work as effectively. The cost of campaigning drops. Money in politics drops. "

It does not magically imply that there is an upthrust of buoyancy or hidden forces of gravity or any other such bullshit.

Any skilled mathematician should be able to find a formula which equates the relative density difference of air and water to the weight differences in the potato."

"Socially, women‚Äôs value is derived from being, men‚Äôs value is derived from doing. As a corollary, men are expendable. 

Its partly cultural and partly how we‚Äôre wired due to evolution‚Äîthe growth of a group of pre-historical humans was more limited by the number of women than the number of men. For a woman, having a kid was a giant commitment, so they had to be more selective in who they had sex with. Sex was a tiny commitment for men, so they were better off having as much of it as possible, and had to take risks to do amazing things to impress women, who again had to be selective. So men who took risks were more likely to pass on their genes, women who didn‚Äôt were more likely to pass on theirs, and societies that enforced roles that enforced both were more likely to survive. As such, if a man gets crushed by a mammoth, its sad but normal, but if a mammoth kills a woman, its shocking and possibly indicative of a threat to the society‚Äôs survival. Men get sent off to fight other tribes and women don‚Äôt because they‚Äôre more likely to have applicable skills from high risk roles and even if a ton of them die society‚Äôs growth in people isn‚Äôt as affected as if the same number of women died (how many kids in a year could a man have vs a woman?). 

That carried on into the modern era (and to a certain extent to today). In ww1, you have women giving men white feathers of cowardice, and men throwing themselves into a meat grinder to prove their worth. Women and children get in the lifeboats first, and if a man and a women are stuck in a burning building you‚Äôre expected to save the woman first. Older men often marry younger women, and women often marry up the social and economic hierarchies. Men still overwhelmingly work in higher risk jobs‚Äîthey account for ~90% of workplace deaths in the U.S. (and hardly anyone knows that statistic). Women are expected to attract men, and men are expected to pursue women. 

I‚Äôm not saying any of this to try and play the oppression olympics, I‚Äôm just offering an explanation. I‚Äôm not an anthropologist either, so take it or leave it‚Äîjust seems to make sense to me."
Huh.  That means that I‚Äôve never lived in a world where all humans lived on the same planet.

"If it's medication you're after, psychologists can't prescribe, so there's no point travelling to see one. A GP can get you started on antidepressants, and maybe refer you to a psychiatrist for more specialised care.  
You could also look into telepsychiatry, which is therapy over the internet/phone. Not sure how you'd go with medication with that route, but a psychiatrist should be able to fax your script to a chemist.  
You could also go to a hospital A&amp;E department, explain that you haven't been able to access any kind of care due to your living situation and ask to speak to a registrar. You'll have a long wait (usually 2+ hours) but they can also prescribe."

Chinook Suffers Hard Landing in Afghanistan

17 January 2009: Kabul, Afghanistan - One U.S. soldier was killed when a CH-47F Chinook helicopter, tail number 05-08012, made a crash landing in eastern Afghanistan on Saturday, the U.S. military said, adding that small arms fire was involved. It was reported that rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) were also involved. The aircraft was reportedly destroyed in the ensuing post crash fire.

""One service member was killed today when a coalition CH-47 helicopter ... conducted a hard landing in eastern Afghanistan,"" the U.S. military said in a statement. ""Though the cause of the landing is currently undetermined, small arms fire was present at the time of the incident.""

Spc. Ezra Dawson, 31, of Las Vegas, Nevada, died in Konar Province, Afghanistan when the Chinook helicopter he was in made a hard landing under combat conditions. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, Fort Hood, Texas.

05-08012 was the first CH-47F helicopter to be lost since the development of the new model airframe

(B/7-101 AVN) DET to 7-17 CAV CH-47F
05-08012

A/C made a hard landing in Kunar Province after being hit by small arms fire and an RPG. A/C was struck in the left main fuel tank by an RPG causing left side to become engulfed in flames and #1 engine failed due to fuel starvation. Upon landing, A/C rolled onto its right side and was destroyed in post crash fire.

but often --- the scars remain. the scars will *always* remain. sometimes, those scars flare up. and no matter how good i get at managing my reaction, sometimes i'm going to fail.

it's on me to minimize that and do the work that i can to ensure that, when i fail, it doesn't make things worse.

but it's also reasonable of me to ask the people i'm in relationships with: hey, i'm fragile in this way, and sometimes i'm going to break, and would you mind holding me when i do?"

"I‚Äôm an amateur musician, and alcohol helps me in a similar way that it does in how you described. For me it‚Äôs not coding, it‚Äôs playing the music with my hands that I hear in my head. It‚Äôs magical yet fleeted, as the alcohol wears off and I feel as if I lose the creativity, improvisation, etc when I am sober.

The truth is however that, for both of us, we believe our most talented self is our drunken self. It‚Äôs a little trick that the melodies/lines of code play on our brains: eg drink this wine, and you play better. Not true. It just makes things like what we‚Äôre talking about easier, more fluid and creative with relative ease. 

We trick ourselves into believing we are only good at these things because of the alcohol influence. 

The fucking truth, man, the truth is that deep down we are talented in what we do. But this pest that we all love so much has betrayed us. It‚Äôs like Stockholm Syndrome: We just keep going back because we believe it can help us and be there for us when we want to create something special. 

Given enough time it will consume you. I suppose some enjoy the thin line between dying and living to see our lives flourish, I know I do, it‚Äôs exhilarating. But  when down to it, either give in to the mothering warmth, or stay cold but take things as they are without illusion."

"It's not a fair comparison since swbf2's planned revenue system was scrapped before launch because of the p2w outcry. They could not make any money out of it since even buying the game premium currency was locked for a while. Then they revamped the progression system and I don't think they released a single map during that time. Then they lost devs to BFV team( I get it, why leave people working post release on a game with no premium pass and no way to make money).

Basically it's a miracle they released anything after release. 

I don't think same will happen to BFV since the post launch revenue will actually work this time."

Vikings were pretty fond of the dane axe(Which is a pretty big weapon), but it was only really caried by nobles- and though they were a status symbol, they still were pretty useful for splitting shields and armor.

Just my two cents."

"When I was in Jr High a random person came up to me telling me her friend loved me. I had never heard of, met, or even talked to this girl in my life as she was 2 years younger than me but she was apparently obsessed with me. This girl then precedes to follow me for the rest of my life in this small town. 

By the end the first year I am being told she is cutting herself because I won't love her back. This is a huge red flag and I tried being nice to a young girl and talk to her and let her down easy. This only made her more obsessed. 

She joins every after school activity I was in. I was a big music nerd so she joined band and chorus. I did theater so she auditioned for the plays. I was in the drum line so she joined the marching band. I did sports so she stayed after school to watch me run. 

She even went so far as to join my church youth group so she could even see me on weekends and go away on retreats with me. While on these retreats my things would somehow go missing and then on the last day miraculously be found by one of her friends... AKA she would steal my hoodie or jacket or whatever and sleep with it. 

This whole time she continued to self harm and would make sure I knew it to try and guilt me into being with her. At one point she would say things like ""When the sun hits my arm just right I can see where I carved his name in my arm"" She would also date people I knew and be sexual with them and brag about it near me to ""Try and make me jealous""

And it all continued when I went away to college but thankfully she didn't get into my university so I was finally away from her. I'm almost 30 now and she will still randomly send me a friend request on social media. 

TL:DR younger girl was obsessed with me for no reason and followed me around and cut herself when I wouldn't love her back. "

"The mobile support definitely leaves a lot to be desired. It says it works on iOS + Android but if you dig a bit deeper you realize that's powered by.... Flash + Adobe AIR. Which may be fine for some people, but I'm also interested in getting actual native support. I think in time that will happen as there is work to port Lime over as a backend (same thing that runs OpenFL + HaxeFlixel), but for now it seems mostly sketched in, but growing.

In terms of IAP, nothing that I know of as part of this framework directly, but as you mentioned packages there looks to be an [IAP lib available on Haxelib.](https://github.com/HaxeExtension/extension-iap) From your comment I can't tell if you're for or against packages, but as someone *for* them, I can usually find what I need on Haxelib. If you want an all-in single framework, this may not be for you, but if you're comfortable bringing in other libs for things like Tweeing, IAP, etc. I think it's great.

In terms of console support, the creator of Heaps [said in a recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CswB_1rSOd0) that they have console support, but you need to reach out to him for the code given the NDA-nature of the console SDKs. Also given that a game like Dead Cells uses Heaps and has released on PS4, Switch, Xbox One, I imagine they've implemented a lot of that. If you're concerned I'd say reach out!"

"&gt;If you wake up, someone tells something to you, you are not processing it right and going back to sleep, when do you think rationally and better yourself?

Behavior isn't something changed overnight, it takes a lot of training and reinforcement. Create reminders for yourself so that even when you're groggy, you can begin to acknowledge what is happening and how you are acting. Reminders can be things you place in the environment, things on your person, key phrases you have your loved ones tell you when you need it, etc. Also making adjustments to your life as well to avoid these circumstances to begin with. (Train yourself for a better sleep schedule; consider doing a sleep study to see if the way you sleep at night adversely affects your brain; etc.) You can slowly change your base, default behaviors to things if you make a point to really work at it. It's not going to be easy, it's going to be hard and arduous, and you may never fully succeed, but the important thing is that you *try*.

And that's the root of my objection here. Not that people are inherently like this (because again, that's also me), but that people resign themselves and refuse to even attempt to change. It's indicative of a closed mind. One that refuses seek self-improvement, accepts defeat, and handles change poorly. If you're like this, you're not necessarily a bad person. But it's an attitude that in my experience makes dealing with a person incredibly hard and is probably not someone I want to spend the short amount of time on this earth heavily invested with."

"1. Due to it's lower clock speeds, worse IPC, and worse memory controller the 1700x is more expensive than the 2600, doesn't come with a stock cooler and is worse for someone who's purely interested in gaming. 
2. The 2600 comes with a stock cooler, so you can ditch the aftermarket CPU cooler you've currently got.
3. There's very little difference in quality / features between your mobo and some of the cheaper B450 offerings. I'd save another $15 by swapping to a cheaper b450.
3. You could shave $20 off the ram cost by dropping to 3000mhz, it's a small downgrade, but will have limited impact on performance.
4. You could double your SSD capacity for only 50% more cost than the current one, imo that's a good return on expenditure, or you could spend a little more on a good quality m.2 drive, that will plug directly into your mobo and help reduce cable clutter within your windowed case.
4. There are cheaper cases, such as the Cougar MX330 that come with a full length PSU shroud, that would allow you to get a semi modular, or non modular PSU and hide all your cable clutter.
5. You could save money by getting a slightly worse quality PSU, but of larger capacity.  A reasonable bronze quality 650w PSU should be almost as efficient as your gold 500w, given your ~400w load.

Those changes would result in a system that looks like this:

"Even socialization won't always help. Dog aggression is genetic, we bred it there on purpose over hundreds of generations, and culled those that didn't exhibit that trait strongly enough and didn't allow them in the gene pool. Like a retriever has an instinct to retrieve, a border collie to herd, we programmed a breed to want to fight other dogs until they are dead and not respond to pain. What you might think is a well socialized 1 year old could be a tyrant at maturity around 2. Now we're having to work backwards to get that trait out, but 99% of people who breed pit bulls are just doing it for easy cash, and have no thoughts in their head about making the breed better. They don't even know their own breeding dogs genetic history. Whether they have a genetic history of dog aggressive or just high anxiety (see: ""my pibble is afraid of everything lol""), they just keep breeding it in. What you see in people's homes and yards are success stories, but we kill hundreds of thousands a year of those who were bred carelessly, and bought by those who thought their love alone could overcome a basic instinct. "
"&gt;	The engineering, management and logistics costs of this will always be cheaper than an orbital habitat with artificial gravity. We know how to build pressurised tunnels and maintain them in condition for human use. We do not know how to build spinning artificial gravity habitats. There's plenty of theory but it's not actually been done yet.

What‚Äôs your justification for this? Orbital habitats need not be large in order to provide artificial gravity, and while yes, we haven‚Äôt built one yet, we have many excellent ideas on how to do so.

Logistics: a habitat orbiting Earth is only minutes away, not months. It can draw upon anything that can be manufactured on Earth if something breaks, whereas a Martian colony has to rely on spares and infrequent Earth resupply until it can build up a manufacturing base, which will take a significant outlay of funding. An orbital colony can be as small as a few hundred people, minimizing the necessary government offices to run it. If someone is injured on Mars and the base doesn‚Äôt have the capabilities to handle it, the risk of their death is correspondingly higher than at a habitat. Moreover, we know 1G has no issues for human health, whereas there are no guarantees for 0.38G, and anyone growing up in that environment will struggle under Earth‚Äôs. Why not avoid that complication entirely?

&gt;	The next investment will be StarLink, then after that will be the capital infrastructure for fuel production on water- and carbon-bearing planets like Mars

This is a terrible idea. Water-bearing asteroids are quite common, and don‚Äôt require multiple additional trips through a gravity well to use. If you wanted to establish early infrastructure for making propellant, the Moon is a better option. Just take hydrogen and combine it with the plentiful oxygen from the lunar surface.

Last, the potential financial return of orbital habitats is much quicker than a Martian colony, in my opinion. Mars doesn‚Äôt offer us anything except what‚Äôs unique to Mars, whereas rotating colonies can be duplicated and used all over the solar system. In the case of Earth, while the Mars colony would be largely limited to information, a habitat could build solar power satellites, assemble spacecraft and satellites, provide an excellent base for all sorts of scientific research, provide a unique manufacturing environment for goods that cannot be made easily or at all on Earth, or be something as prosaic as a hotel. Mars cannot do much of that, or at least not in a way it could compete with a habitat.

All this is not to say that we should never colonize Mars, only that to claim it‚Äôs clearly be best option is to ignore the many downsides and limitations it would have. I‚Äôm glad Musk is working hard to take people there, I just think for a truly spacefaring civilization Mars is more of a hindrance than a stepping stone."

"Welcome to a beta.  Hopefully they got some good data on how their scaling system works.  Hopefully they're tweaking it, keeping demand high and getting everyone to hit it hard the next time.

Having people spend 40 hours in the game before it's launched is bad for the game.  This is a common issue with most MMOs in the past decade.  By launch there is no mystery, no joy of exploration and the most excited of the fan base has already mastered most gameplay elements.

If people feel misled, I guess I can understand that.  My assumption going into any beta is that it's broken, they need bugs discovered and written and that it'll be down whenever they need it to be.

2 months from now, the only people who care about today will be the people who didn't buy y the game or bailed 15 hours in.  They'll use this as a reason why the game is bad.  They'll have heartaches by the number, while everyone else is just letting their spurs jingle jangle jingle as they travel merrily along through the west Virginian wasteland."

"Time to learn about the Life-changing Magic of Doing Nothing!

Here's how it works: don't send the text. Say to yourself, I'll wait three days, see how I feel.

Wait three days. Then say to yourself, you know what, I'll give it a week, see how I feel.

When you get to that point, you say, you know what, I'll give it a month, see how I feel.

Do this and you'll quickly discover that doing absolutely zero in regard to this matter is the way to go. 

It stops you worrying about ""fixing"" a situation (that, by the way, is unfixable). It makes you realize that nothing bad will happen to you.

I'm going to add that alcoholics will find any and all reasons to drink again. Blaming his mother is a good one. And if she was suddenly sweet as pie, it would be something else.

You can't fix this situation. You can't change her or him. You can't make up some magical combination of words in a text that will suddenly make the world the way you want it to be.

When you accept this, you then will realize that focusing on yourself is the way to move forward. Focus on school. Focus on your life.

I can tell you this - people can and will think all sorts of nonsense about you. It's not up to you to attempt to change that.

I'll also add that families of alcoholics don't want to face reality either - it's comfortable to blame someone else for why a family member drinks. 

Who has had more influence in his life - his mother who raised him since birth, or you, the partner who has only known him a relatively short time?

She feels guilt and so directs that blame outward. 

Frankly, if his mother is calling you a whore *now* and has never met you, it's never going to be better. There isn't a beautiful wedding coming up where she is all sweetness and light. He says it's better to take a break - just say yes and then block his number. 

Then embrace the magical life-changing power of doing nothing. Go to school, go to work and watch all the bullshit in your life just evaporate. "

"I'm not sure what the red flags are, but I do know that I have been diagnosed with OCD and that sounds an awful lot like me as a kid. Looking back, I struggled with it even in early elementary. I just didnt have a name for it.

But dont worry too much about it even if it is. Drugs and treatment are amazing these days. Anecdotes arent data, but I have a fairly normal, even ""successful"" life despite this. And that's with coming from a family too poor to afford treatment, and who liked to punish any signs of mental illness and sweep it under the rug. (I was punished once for being suicidal, for jnstance.)

If someone has a good home life and gets early treatment, the effects can probably be mitigated even more substantially, even to the point of remission. 

I hope that's informative and somewhat reassuring to you."

"Biggest problems are:

- Character ruining backstory. Literally the reason for Michael Myers being scary is because there was never a motive given for why he went crazy. I did not care for his childhood at all, and especially done in such a grimy, shitty, Rob Zombie way. Also I HATED the kid playing young Michael. Holy shit, what an awful choice. 

- Michael being a fucking giant. God, I hated that more than almost anything else. Michael being of average height made it at least somewhat plausible that he could blend in and avoid being noticed, but a seven-foot tall behemoth wanders around Haddonfield all day and no one notices?

- The ""Halloween Greatest Hits"". After Michael escapes and kills Joe Grizzly (another awful, needlessly gross and repellant character), the movie is pretty much just the original movie done at double time. Laurie drops off the key, bing bang boom, Annie gets knifed, Lynda gets strangled, Bob gets pinned to the wall, yadayadayada. We've seen it all before, and done much better before. 

Overall, the movie felt pointless. Michael's childhood? Unnecessary and cliche. Then once that was over, we just get the original movie again done in half the time. If you HAVE to remake Halloween (which you don't, it's a classic), at least take it somewhere new and - more importantly - interesting. This movie did neither."

When I apply for a position it typically takes me a minimum of an hour (usually 2-3 hours is spent per job application for me) to reword my cover letter (CL) and even tailor my resume to their position (changing my key skills around depending on what they are looking for so the most relevant ones are first), including doing the necessary research on their company to ensure I use some of their values in my CL. I like to really make sure they can see how much effort I've put into researching the position and their company and ensuring my CL properly promotes myself to be the best candidate for the position.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're not tailoring every single resume and cover letter to each individual position, it will show. I feel no matter which resume you use, you need to put in a lot more work when applying for jobs, and not just sending it directly through whatever job site you're using. Also, it's always best to try and find them on LinkedIn and see if you can find out who the hiring manager is (getting their direct email is even better) so you can be ahead of the curve in using their name in the CL. I always like to add them to my LinkedIn connections so they can instantly see my profile once they've looked at my resume."

"Victus is a novel, yes. I said that. A novel that combines fiction parts, like the training of the main character under Vauban, but that then goes on to depict both the war methods of the time, and the actual events of the War of Sucession, everything in a highly humorous way. Highly illustrated, with notes and an actual chronology. It's original edition even has a bookmark with the roles of about 30 historical figures of that conflict, so that you don't get lost in it's complexity.

The novel isn't historical revisionism, everything it describes it's well documented. It's author is an anthropologist, africanist and an historian, and actually a great fiction writer of international success (his first ovel, [Cold Skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Skin_\(novel\), has been translated to about 40 languages).

"[Interview with Diedrich Bader](https://youtu.be/7x07F0AL5F4#t06m16s) beginning at the start of the Harley Quinn talk.


&gt;While chatting to Discussing Film, Batman: The Brave and the Bold's Diedrich Bader - who will reprise the role of The Caped Crusader for this show - mentions that Tudyk will be providing the voice of The Joker, and Chris Meloni (Happy) will play a ""somewhat different"" take on Jim Gordon.



&gt;We also know that Big Bang Theory alum Kaley Cuoco will voice Harley, but the characters Lake Bell, Ron Funches, JB Smoove, Jason Alexander, Wanda Sykes, Giancarlo Esposito, Natalie Morales, Jim Rash and Tony Hale are playing renain a mystery for now.




If I had to guess &amp; fill in some of the blanks, going off of the [allegedly leaked character breakdowns](https://comicbook.com/dc/2018/02/08/harley-quinn-animated-series-characters-joker-harley/) from awhile back, a remainder of the cast is probably as follows...


**Poison Ivy** - Lake Bell 


**Dr. Psycho** - Jason Alexander 


**King Shark** - Ron Funches 


**Clayface** - Jim Rash *or* Tony Hale


**Sy Borgman** - Giancarlo Esposito 


**Malice Vundabar** - Natalie Morales"

Until fairly recently it was common to shoot a handgun with only one hand so that shouldn't be an issue.  The only problem you'll have is loading and charging your chosen firearm.  You can usually use a holster to load a full mag so that's not an issue.  The only real problem i see is racking the slide with the barrel in a safe direction.

"Gun prices go way the fuck up during Democratic presidencies and tank like a stone in the ocean during Republican presidencies. Part of why the NRA's advertising has gotten so weird (to put it mildly) is that they're trying to shore up flagging gun sales with Trump as president.

The funny part is that Obama never passed gun control, and Republicans have, historically, passed their fair share of gun control legislation, including Reagan in the 60s as governor of California, and [Reagan in the 80s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act) (and no you can't just say it was just Reagan because it passed with the vast majority of Republicans in both houses of Congress supporting it - it was [mostly Democrats](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/99-1985/s142) who opposed this expansion of gun control!). The main gun control measures passed by Democrats have been the Assault Weapons Ban from the 90s and gun control measures in mostly Democratic-controlled states like New York."

"Women are a lot more subtle than men when it comes to giving compliments.  I work out and try to stay fit, and I‚Äôll get compliments on my body, but it‚Äôll be more stuff like, ‚ÄúAre you a swimmer?  You look like a swimmer,‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably too healthy for that,‚Äù if there‚Äôs office birthday cake.  Little stuff where they‚Äôll let me know they notice my figure without actually saying it.

Men say that women don‚Äôt give signs, but they do.  You just have to know what to look for.  Was she looking at you from across the room, and did she look away after a second when you noticed and made eye contact?  That‚Äôs the woman you should go up and talk to at a party.  Is she touching your arm a lot?  Is she playing with her hair?  These are all signs that she‚Äôs interested, and they‚Äôre often the closest things to compliments you‚Äôll get from a woman you aren‚Äôt dating."

"Just realized you're including boss fights, in which case your methodology needs to be changed. Characters with less SPD and higher attack are going to be better. 

Attack is always going to give you better returns. SPD randomly increases and decreases at the start of a round. Attack doesn't. And If you have 3 characters faster than the boss than all they are doing Is competing for order. 

A character with slower speed is going to take just as many turns, speed only determines the order the actions are taken. If you're faster than the boss at D speed, 3 D speed characters will take just as many actions. 

Iirc It takes roughly 15 turns of straight battle for an S character to get 1 more turn than a B speed character. It takes 30 turns to get 1 more action than an A spd character. Do auto boss fights ever take more than 30 turns for the last round?

Edit: fyi the testing was extra turns from speed done by Safeena. She doesnt publish it because it's a work in progress. "
"there's a few people on this thread asking what this score is supposed to tell them, and most of them are getting downvoted.

&amp;#x200B;

These people are absolutely correct that this metric doesn't really tell you anything.  It is also the correct approach to question what a statistic is supposed to be telling you.  As far as I understand it, the Dwyer score is a general context thing and is supposed to ignite conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most important aspects of presenting statistics to the public - no matter who you are; politician, journalist, blogger, whatever - is to present this type of information *honestly.*  the public has a very hard time with statistics because they often don't understand what they mean.  there is a contemporary trend of presenting statistics as some sort of proof of ""truth.""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think the Dwyer score is a robust statistical metric by any means, and the most important thing here is honesty.  Nick does not present this statistic as anything that it isn't.  He's entirely honest about it:

&gt;When you tally up the scores for every fighter on a card, you get a total for the event- the ‚ÄòDwyer Score.‚Äô This score does not claim to predict or measure the quality or excitement of any one card, but it does give you an idea of the general momentum of fighters heading into a specific event.

&amp;#x200B;

Nick -  if you ever want ideas about how to develop or push this stat into more robust territory, I'm glad to have a conversation with you with my limited knowledge and experience using statistics.  I have some ideas.  I've been somewhat curious about what impact ""MMA sabermetrics"" would have on the sport."

"Well, the Dems were the pro-segregation party at one point.  I'm probably off on exactly when, but there was a rapid flip of the base of the Republicana and Democrats around the 1950s.  States that were reliably red became reliably blue and vice versa.

But yea, in 2018, there shouldn't be a pro-segregation/pro-Confederacy party.  I get we're a long way from racial equality, but you can at least pretend to not be overtly racist.  Minds aren't changed in a day.

"&gt; Furthermore, pedophilia is beneficial to societies as it ensures reproduction starts at a young age and women are able to have their children around the prime of their breeding age (which is generally the late teens). This means that societies would replaced themselves rapidly, replacing losses suffered during war and disease, along with high-quality offspring produced via early breeding.

I'm all for clearing up misconceptions on pedophilia but this makes no sense. If you mean that it's an evolutionary advantage to have puberty begin early and therefore have sexual attraction younger then I agree (only for the sake of population insurance, not quality of life).

This has nothing to do with pedophilia. Pedophilia is the attraction to prepubescent children who, by definition, can't reproduce.

"**So let me ask you, and try not to ignore all the questions this time:**

**What makes you think there's a creator?**

**Do you have evidence for a creator? If not, why should anyone accept your claim?**

&gt; Would you say there is any explanation of existence that would be better than theism?

I'd say that I'm not going to claim to know, since it'd be frankly foolish of me to do so if I can't back up my claim. If you can't back up theism, which I am asking you to do, then I don't know why you're using it as an explanation. 

&gt; That's within the room in the analogy. Plus my argument wasn't about individual atheists.

Clearly wasn't the kind of guy who'd deny the shot at finding out the answer. I also don't care if it wasn't about individual atheists, since you made another generalization that's pretty unfounded‚Äî Hawking goes against your generalization. I do too. Probably many atheists here do.

&gt; My argument was it's rational to pursue a supposed purpose, whether it exists or not.

It's rational to pursue the truth. If your hypothesis fails, then either refine it or accept that it doesn't work. So test your hypothesis with me. What do you have to support that claim? If you have nothing, I see no reason to accept it."

"&gt;And the Mighty have just been locked into a deathtrap by a villain who monologued about their inevitable victory and walked away: on a level it would be surprising if they didn't break out.

That's a heroic story though, and these guys are definitely not heroes by any stretch of the imagination. Plus, it has to compete with the existing narrative of 'newcomer crushes arrogant pre-existing power structure.'

&gt;As to whether they could beat a Fae - Urulan had the power, skill, and tricks necessary to nearly kill Cat, queen of the faeries, and there are now seven guys stronger than he was with reason to forma cabal and a story to back them.

Oh, I agree that if they could force a fae noble into a slugging match the Mighty could probably take even a prince down, it's just that I doubt they'd have the opportunity. Even if they were lucky enough to have a noble wander by and get curious (which, as you say, isn't as unlikely in Arcadia as it might be in reality) I don't think the noble would be stupid enough to get into a fight with a whole team of powerful opponents. And even if they did, or the drow just attacked instantly, fae nobles are tricky bastards with thousands of years of experience and powers the Mighty have never seen- it's likely they could slip the noose and make with the fleeing like a proper villain."

Also, double check to make sure filenames/extensions match up. The way it's written in your pic looks like there may be a space between ""(USA)"" and the "".img"" file extension for the ROM. This might not be the case for the actual filename. 



If the above doesnt help...

Consider adding a publisher or other release info to this entry. If those details show up fine but only the boxart doesnt, then you know the issue is how that image file is being referenced. If nothing shows up at all, then the issue is likely how the game itself is being referenced."

I'd say it should be either or, full automatic or completely manual.

Also there's still workarounds like the one in the original comment. These basically remove the need for manual adjustment if you know how, so why make it mandatory. "

On the one hand you can pay more to spend less time getting a bag much more likely to be quality stuff. On the other hand you can pay less money by spending more time on something with a higher risk of failing on you. It's really more a matter of which resources you have and are willing to spend."

"[North and south India are growing apart and it could be a problem](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/north-and-south-india-are-growing-apart-and-it-could-be-a-problem-118042400129_1.html)

&gt;India ‚Äî more diverse than Europe, more populous than Africa ‚Äî has never been an entirely cohesive country. A rupee note has to find space for 17 languages; India‚Äôs Constitution specifically mentions 22 official languages and is written in a twenty-third, English. Originally, it was hoped that Hindi, the language of India‚Äôs northern hinterland, would replace English as the language linking India‚Äôs states. But, 50 years ago, that assumption led to riots and even secessionist movements in the south, particularly in Tamil Nadu, and so English has been kept on permanently. For years, the compromise seemed to hold; the Hindi-speaking hinterland and the non-Hindi coastal states muddled along together.

&gt;Recently, however, that uneasy, decades-old accord has broken down. Formerly, the long-ruling Congress party linked the two regions together by drawing voters from both. Modi‚Äôs BJP has since replaced the Congress as the dominant force in Indian politics, but very much remains much a party of the north and the west, with little or no presence in states like Tamil Nadu.

&gt;Even more disruptive is the fact that north and south have diverged economically and demographically. The richer south resents having to subsidize the rest of the country. Tamil Nadu gets back 30 rupees for every 100 it sends to New Delhi; the northern state of Bihar, by contrast, receives 219. The chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, who recently ended his alliance with Modi‚Äôs party, has accused the federal government of ‚Äúdiverting‚Äù the south‚Äôs money to the north.

OK so basically the same problem that Catalonia has.

&gt;Meanwhile, India‚Äôs interior has human development indicators equivalent to sub-Saharan Africa, while the southern states‚Äô human development indices resemble those of upper-middle-income countries. In particular, women are more empowered in many coastal states. Consequently, they have fewer children. Female fertility in many southern states is below the replacement rate; up north, women might have three or four children on average.

Huh? 

Let's introduce this [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_and_union_territories_by_GDP_per_capita#/media/File:Indian_states_and_union_territories_by_GRDP_(nominal)_per_capita.png) and [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_and_territories_by_Human_Development_Index)

Note that [Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi), [Chandigarh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh), [Goa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa), [Puducherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puducherry), [Dadra and Nagar Haveli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadra_and_Nagar_Haveli) and [Daman and Diu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daman_and_Diu) are too small and probably too urban to be comparable to other states/union territories. [Lakshadweep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshadweep) and [Andaman and Nicobar Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands) are islands so they aren't comparable to other states/union territories either.

Well I have observed the fact that South India is richer than North India on average. But higher HDI? Not really.


Why?

&gt;Southerners have put these facts together and come to the uncomfortable conclusion that they could wind up becoming a permanent minority politically. Populations in areas that support the BJP will continue to grow in size, while those where the party has no followers are shrinking.

I'm not familiar with India. However I do find that my Indian STEM friends are predominantly South Indian.. It seems that there is something interesting happening in India. What caused South India to be richer than North India?"

"Here is my take. 

1. Be enthusiastic. If you are into the person you are with, you should be enjoying yourself. Laugh, moan, say what you like, just don‚Äôt be dead. A lot of the best sex is because both people are into it.
2. Be confident. I want to see you naked. Not naked and trying to act sexy, but naked and confident. A wild time is not had because you blew me, but did so under the sheets and in your oversized t-shirt.
3. Initiate. I‚Äôm a guy. The times I have not been DTF are so limited, that it should have never entered your mind in the situation. So, take a chance occasionally, and initiate.
4. Have boundaries, sure. But realize the more you have, the less exciting you are going to be. For instance, anal. We all get that you can‚Äôt just stick it in and drive. If a guy did this to you, or a woman with accoutrements, sorry. Don‚Äôt let that fool you, however. Lots of dudes will take their time to get to the promise land and both of you will enjoy it. But if it isn‚Äôt your thing, cool. The more of those limits you have though... the less fun you are going to be. ‚ÄúWild‚Äù sex is just that. It‚Äôs going into territory that might be unknown. So a woman who: won‚Äôt swallow, doesn‚Äôt want semen in her mouth at all, won‚Äôt anal, doesn‚Äôt wanna be on top, no facials, no porn, no mutual masturbation, no cunnilingus, limited blowjobs, no threesomes, etc. Any one or two of those things, hey, those are boundaries. Alot or all of those things just starts seem completely boring.

People enjoy a ‚Äúback and forth‚Äù kind of conversation about a single topic, rather than each person limiting conversation to themselves/their own experiences. Being quick witted definitely does help, if you‚Äôre able to come up with puns and jokes on the spot, but that‚Äôs a tough skill to learn. You could try asking more questions to support the conversation while not putting pressure on yourself to create interesting statements from thin air.

But seriously, don‚Äôt force conversation if you aren‚Äôt feeling it. Sometimes, just sit back and enjoy the banter between your friends. If you focus on listening, you‚Äôll pay more attention to what they‚Äôre saying, and words/ideas/jokes may naturally come to you."

"I went through something similar. I met a guy who was extremely against tattoos (even though he had one himself?) I have more than most people and usually visible no matter what I'm wearing. He knew I had them before he asked me to be with him, so not really sure what his agenda was there. I got my nipples pierced while we were together and he threw an absolute hissy fit. It was a short lived relationship. It's okay to have a preference, not okay to dog somebody about the choices they make for their own body. I love my tattoos and piercings, never regretted any of them. "

It is **YOUR OWN** understanding of religious freedom as it applies **IN QU√âBEC** that is flawed.

Having suffered **A LOT** at the hands of the catholic church, we have an extremely dim view of religion, and given how much it rots the mind of people, we just don't want religious zealots corrupting the minds of fragile people.

Say what you will about the people's distaste for the what the democrats did, but in the end they only backed their chosen candidate over a fair-time democrat (independent before election, independent again after election), which I don't really consider to be anywhere near disgusting like so many people do, and then when to vote for Trump, but if they never knew that, she would have won, and Trump has Russia to thank, and you may not believe he conspired, but at the very least, they wanted to in the Trump tower meeting, which intent is all that matter anyway.

Trump has treated our allies shamefully. That is all there is to it. Rationalize his embarrassing us to our partners in the world all you want, but that is what he is, an embarrassment, and he has cost us American influence and power, which is exactly why Germany is right to question our superpower status. 

Not all power is hard power and Trump has sacrificed so much of our influence its staggering."

"No. Just no. Please base what you say on the facts you have available to you.

[Right here](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-wheel-rim-controversy-mercedes-ferrari/3200763/):

&gt;Motorsport.com learned that the FIA looked into exactly what Mercedes was doing with its wheel rim and hubs, and found it to fully comply with the regulations.

&gt;But after Ferrari made it clear at the United States Grand Prix that it did not agree with the FIA interpretation, Mercedes elected to modify its rims to avoid any potential risks of a protest from its rival.

&gt;With ongoing uncertainty about where things stand now, F1 race director Charlie Whiting has suggested that it may be best to add the topic to the agenda of the new Technical Working Group.

&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think a clarification is needed because we‚Äôve already done that, everyone‚Äôs aware of what we feel,‚Äù said Whiting, when asked by Motorsport.com about the latest situation."

"DD is an intriguing writer in my eyes. I keep reading their stuff, and it helps that the stories are short, but they never stay with me for some reason. [Between the Lines](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1465963) and [Dumbledore's Folly](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7866067) are the only fics I have saved as favourites from DD, but I couldn't tell you what happens in them if my life depended on it.

Do you know any good courtship fics? I suppose length doesn't matter as long as they are mind-blowingly good. I'm not a fan of the forced bonding trope, so I have a hard time with nearly all fics revolving around it. I'm racking my brain and can't come up with a single forced bonding fic I've enjoyed. 

I'm so happy someone understands how I feel, though. I wish I could go back to 2003-2010 and zealously follow my favourite authors as they put out fic by fic. I love that period. It did help me a lot when you (was it you?) recommended The Boy Who Died a Lot to me - that fic made me appreciate Snarry all over again. I wish I could find something like that again.

"As far as Toronto's offer, I'm getting my information from the TSN guys and they say the deal won't be any less than 6.5 million. They expect 6.5-7.2 at the maximum. Our offer would have to be higher than that to make them question matching it. I would assume if we offer sheet him a huge deal on a long contract, Simmonds is gone. 

I'm down to let our forwards take their time to make the team. Personally, I would rather see the hypothetical Nylander money go to a defensemen or two but he's an amazing player that would make letting Simmonds walk easier for sure.

Would an 8x7 be enough to make them not match it? Would going higher than 8 million be too much of an expected overpay for Nylander? With Lehtera, MacDonald, Weise, Raffl, Weal, and potentially Simmonds money coming off our books within two years, this is doable if you like what Nylander brings and are comfortable with him at eight million. I may be wrong but at 8 million, the compensation for that is a first, second, and third round pick, which with our draft history, I'm fine giving up for Nylander.

Tbh, they'd probably match 8 million and just try to get Marner at 8 too. Higher than 8.1ish and its 2 firsts, a second, and a third which I think is too much.

I want to say I saw somewhere that the AAV for compensation is calculated from the first 5 years of the contract only but I have source for that, but, that would make 8x7 mean the next tier of compensation instead of just a first, second, and third."

"Diagnostics are run on the machines before, each morning, and after they are returned. It's just not practical to go after the machines themselves; there are too many moving parts and too much risk exposure. Not to mention there are too many layers of security to allow one or two individuals to go around and manipulate the machines themselves. 

The free federal funding offered was for 'cybersecurity' upgrades by the feds. That was looked at by Georgia (and numerous other states) as a potential power grab by the Federal government. Remember, nothing is free.

The refusing of paper ballots was because it was too close to election time. The amount of cost / confusion / complexity was infeasible. Kemp (and Georgia officials) have agreed that the voting machines need to be replaced and will be replaced before 2020. 

And to your last point. The servers were backed up before being wiped / repurposed by Kennesaw State. The backups were sent to the FBI and are still in their possession. According to Kemp and according to KSU, the servers were wiped without direction from Kemp's office. So take that for what you will.

"In my case, what I do is I take a deposit that is non-refundable when they want me to take it off the market. The amount is often something like $100 or $200, in fact I let them set the amount. But never less than a hundred. It's just so they have some skin in the game.

 If they can't come up with the full amount due at the signing of the lease they lose that initial non-refundable deposit.

I've had good tenants who have moved in without paying the full deposit and have paid their rent on time all along, it's just that at the time of moving out I don't have that security deposit to hold against whatever damages. And it's easier for them to leave you high and dry, because they're not going to lose their deposit. 

Even though you might think people are nice and they're not doing this on purpose, somewhere in the back of their mind they're thinking , maybe even subconsciously, well I'm here already why do I need to pay the deposit?

3. I have never seen this employed anywhere (aside from double round robin, which uses a different scoring system)
4. I have also never seen this mentioned anywhere as an alternative - I have seen DRR, I have seen Basque Chess, I have seen this ""Play a Speedchess Game afterwards"" now in Norway and previously in.. Grenke(?), but never what I am proposing here
5. It would be nice if you commented A) Whether you disagree with the issue listed; B) With whether my proposed solution solves those issues (if they are ones) or not; C) If you find the down- outweigh the upsides (and perhaps whether you know of additional problems that this would cause)

I don't particularly care whether this is new and original. The question is whether it's a good idea (for all I care, let's say it's another idea of Philidor, rather than ""mine"". I'm not expecting to make money out of it).

Seeing how apparently it's not a new idea, and you've done it already in your club - how did it go? How was it received by the players? Do you have a guess as to why no supertournament organizer has ever played around with it? As you are writing in past tense, why did you stop using it?

Thank you :)"

"Well you are contradicting me in that I have already stated that I wasn't saying that buildings don't objectively exist. You also keep stating that I am arguing for solipsism even though I have said I'm not, which is really starting to annoy me to be honest.


I am not stating the physical things don't objectively exist. This whole discussion is supposed to be about objective moral values but somehow we keep getting on irrelevant topics.

Objective moral values may or may not exist, but they can't come from minds. That is exactly how the word objective is used in this topic, by many philosophers. That is how I have seen it used in philosophical discussion.

That is even how it is framed in the supposed moral argument for god's existence. So it isn't something that I have just made up. They usually frame it as it can't come from ""human"" minds specifically, but I find that to be an example of special pleading.

We consider 2+2=4 to be objectively true, typically. Why do we do that? Because 2+2=4 is true regardless of what anyone thinks. If someone disagrees, they are wrong. That is how objective truth is supposed to work. 

If there are objective moral values, then they must work the same way. That means if it is objectively true that murder is wrong, then it is wrong even if someone(i.e. God) were to say that it wasn't. It doesn't matter what God says morality is, because what is true is not dependent on what *anyone* says about it.

If morality doesn't work that way, then it isn't objective.

Furthermore, this definition as used by said economists is not particularly different from the **colloquial** definition (you seem not to know what literal means), other than that it concerns itself specifically with labor and reproduction of labor and/or value.

&gt; Surplus means an excess of production or supply over demand.

Not in capitalism, no.  Surplus in capitalism is an excess of production over **the cost of reproduction**.  If I plant 5 apples to grow 5 apples ad infinitum, the cost of reproduction is 5 apples.  Any quantity I grow over this is surplus.  If I, by planting 5, I one day grow 7 and decide to eat two, I still have produced a surplus of 2 despite that I ""demanded"" them.  If I then plant the remaining 5 again, and I only grow 5, now I have a deficit of 2, a recession... even if I don't want to eat 2 apples and am perfectly satiated.

This is why GDP is measured in percent growth, not percent over some arbitrary fixed point.

&gt; Labor simply means work.

Thanks for clarifying.

&gt; The work exceeded the need to sustain enough crop for the individuals needs would be considered surplus labor in this instance.

No.  The work which exceeds that needed to sustain enough crop to sustain the individual to work again for the same period would be considered surplus labor.  If you don't understand the difference, I suggest you return to (((ECONOMICS 101))).  If the individual has no interest in working for the same period and opts to only work half as much and therefore produces half as much, they still suffer a recession even if they produce **precisely as much as they need**.

&gt; If surplus labor produced a surplus of goods, I am entitled to the fruits of my labor via the natural right of property.

Assuming you actually produce a surplus, whether you want it or are entitled to it or whatever else is irrelevant to this conversation.  The claim was that in order for society to have a right to X, surplus labor was necessary, and it was necessary to extract said surplus labor.

Surplus labor is not necessary for people to have a right to X as it is wholly possible for society to engage in _only as much labor as is required to produce X_ and therefore to secure everyone's right to X with no surplus."

"One day i came home from school, and the door to my house was locked as usual, so i went in through my grandma's apartment (she lives with us because she has diabetes and is paralysed from her left side) and she gave me some gummies, which i thought was nice at the time, so took like 3 and ate them. Shortly after, my dad came home, and asked if i wanted to go to whataburger with him, which of course i agreed to. We sat in the sun waiting for our food, and i started to get dizzy. At first, i thought it was just the sun's heat, but when i got home, the dizziness only got worse. I cpuldn't stop thinking, had short memory, and i found some stupid minecraft video to be the craziest thing i ever saw, but i still couldn't concentrate on it.

"&gt;yes i am with drug prohib simply because there will always be people that do it anyways, we just need to limit the number of people that do it.

Why do we need to do this, and why do you think the WoD is an effective way to do that when drugs are cheaper and more available than they have ever been?

You realize that America has spent literally *trillions* of dollars on the war on drugs only to see it completely fail in its mission while also setting medical research back 40 years? It's beyond reason to say that the war on drugs holds up under honest logical analysis of its goals and results. 


&gt;People need to understand before having sex about the consequences, and if they're not smart enough to understand, then that's on them in dealing with the consequences.

Except it's not on them. It's on everyone. It's on *us*. It is *us* who lives with the unwanted, neglected, abused, and discarded children that grow up to be our unheard, our sick, and our criminal members of society. We all have to deal with it, because we all live in it. 

&gt;3. I do not know how much it would take but i do know that taking ANY amount of drugs is not good for your body.

You have a problem with how much skin people show when they dress themselves but pornography is A-OK? You could scramble eggs with mental backflips like that. 


&gt;5. KimK has posed nude online numerous times, making young women think that it's okay to follow what she's doing when in reality it is not. This trend will only become more common. How could you possibly think it is okay for a mother to be posing nude for the whole world to see when they have a family and kids? sounds like an attention seeker.

I don't get how it's inherently not okay for a parent to do nude work, as you suggest. The child has a high chance of growing up extremely comfortable and adept regarding their sexuality. It has risks and it may or may not have any significant impact on the kid's life, much like any other parents job.

That aside, pretty sure she didn't have a family or kids at that point, and most female porn stars take a break when they have kids for obvious reasons. "

"I'm an liberal and I really really think liberalism needs to stand its ground as the defacto human rights party and come down on Islam like a hammer.

However, the main problem is that pretty much *everyone*, of any conceivable political party has this deeply seated idea that religion, especially Islam, is special, or above criticism and mockery, and cannot separate criticism of Islam/Muslim culture from hatred/criticism of invididual Muslims for no other reason than they're Muslim. 

The root of the problem is the idea that deeply held religious beliefs are above scrutiny, mockery, or criticism. It's part of the human mind, when your beliefs are attacked, you feel attacked too. But their feelings don't supersede human rights.

Also, criticism of Islam and the tackling of its most horrible problems come prepackaged with some serious alt-right/downright Nazi or racist shit more often than not, and a lot of the same people speaking out against Islam are *also* the same people who want what is essentially Christian sharia law.

It's going to be extremely difficult to convince a lot of liberals that you have no issues with individual random people just because they're Muslim, or brown people, because you speak out against Islam, or convince them that the most heinous desecration of religion iconography/the most vicious ripping apart of their beliefs does not constitute hate speech, because religion is a concept and cannot feel or bleed. (And good luck convincing reddit that's not """"edgy"""", even though doing the very thing that would get you flayed if you did it in another country is a fantastic and well documented way of lessening the stranglehold or sacred status of violent ideologies)

We're also going to have a tough time convincing a lot of conservatives that while it's great they're appalled by Islam's atrocities, they fact that they only care about LGBT people when Muslims are persecuting them, and the fact that many of them blatantly ignore Christian terrorism, or even outright condone it, shows that they don't really grasp or care about human rights as much as they claim to when they talk about Islam.

Respectful liberal communities that are focused solely on science, human rights, and fighting religious persecution without bigotry towards people for being religious exist, but they usually only have a few thousand members. TheThinkingAthiest/Theatheistexperience are good examples.

Islam needs to stop being a sacred cow, and they best way to counter it is by understanding how it spreads, which always boils down to indoctrination and lack of scientific literacy and critical thinking skills. All political parties should be focusing on those if they want to tackle the monster of Islam.

I also don't think people are appalled enough by Islam. The fact that our own Islam subreddit right here on reddit routinely condones forcing their religion on others, torture, infant genital mutilation, pedophilia, and the hatred of LGBT people is absolutely shocking and reddit's admins are shameless, spineless, monstrous cowards for letting the swath of hate subreddits we still have stand.

Windows 10 and SMB shares do not seem to get along. I am having similar problems with 2 Raspberry Pis set up as NASs. I can't see them from my Windows 10 PC but can from my Windows 7 PC but I can SSH to them from Windows 10 and view their web interface from Windows 10 - very confusing.  I have tried several forums but no one has been able to give me a solution. Your problem is even further complicated because you SMB share is on a different subnet to your computers. Generally you need to set up routing between the different subnets on you router to allow access.

u/xxsilence is correct. Those collars are ineffective and often cruel. They can cause the dog a lot of stress as they don't associate the shock/beep/vibration (whatever type of collar you've got) with the act of barking. So they just think they're randomly being shocked or whatever. As a result those collars don't solve the issue of barking. Instead they can make their anxiety much worse and cause larger behavioural problems in the long run.

"&gt;Mesh networking -- Unless we're imagining these ships being used alone, there is a lot of value is allowing them to share a tactical picture of the threats the face and assemble that into a single cohesive view. Sharing data in real time, likely via a satellite uplink to reduce radio noise, would disperse command and control effectively and provide a better sense of blind spots in coverage.

We already have that today (and have for some time), and the data links are capable of interoperating with various combat direction systems, even those of allied navies.

"Hard to be sure. The Olympian gods and the giants he released from Tartarus certainly fought at his side against Cronus and some of the straining gods.

Ovid (sorry to break to rules of the sub and mention him) suggests that Zeus won a one-on-one battle before the war proper:

- ""Saturnus was thrust from his realm by Jove. In anger he stirs the mighty Titanes to arms and seeks the assistance owed by fate.""

Some writings suggest one-on-one but could mean as war leaders:

- Homer: ""at that time when Zeus of the wide brows drove Kronos underneath the earth and the barren water.""

- Hesiod: ""And he was reigning in heaven, himself holding the lightning and glowing thunderbolt, when he had overcome by might his father Kronos"" although he also implies the victory was down to the HH giants, ""And amongst the foremost Kottos and Briareos and Gyes insatiate for war raised fierce fighting: three hundred rocks, one upon another, they launched from their strong hands and overshadowed the Titanes with their missiles, and buried them beneath the wide-pathed earth, and bound them in bitter chains when they had conquered them by their strength for all their great spirit, as far beneath the earth to Tartaros""

There is an elemental battle between the pair described:

- Nonnus: ""Broadbeard Kronos fanned the flame of Enyo as he cast icy spears against Kronion, shooting his cold watery shafts: sharp pointed arrows of hail were shot from the sky. But Zeus armed himself with more fires than Helios and melted the petrified water with hotter sparks"" and ""He sang the true victory of Zeus potent in the Heights, how broadbeard Kronos (Cronus) sank under the thunderbolt""

Prometheus meanwhile claims it was guile not force that won the day:

- Aeschylus: ""Often my mother Themis, or Gaia (though one form, she had many names), had foretold to me the way in which the future was fated to come to pass. That it was not by brute strength nor through violence, but by guile that those who should gain the upper hand were destined to prevail."""

"That's absolute bullshit, I got surgery on mine when I was 16 because I couldn't play outside for more than 5 minutes without my lips turning blue, and the doctor said it was caused by compression to my heart due to pectus, once I healed up it was like night and day. I can see it being a non issue if its mild, but saying they aren't linked is asinine imo"
"So I was induced Sunday night and we just got home (baby is great btw). My FIL took my husband to get everyone food while we were in the hospital and the whole drive was trying to convince my husband not to vaccinate our baby. My husband basically just said to drop it and nothing he could say would change anything. Today my FIL drove my husband to the pharmacy to pick up my pain meds and again the entire time talked about why we shouldn't vaccinate. Not only that but he said he was thinking about how much money he could offer us to not vaccinate our baby. 

I'm fucking livid. My husband wanted this time to be about bonding with family. I thought my FIL was spending time with my husband to have some father son type talks. I know hubby wanted that and not only did he not get it, but what he got instead was complete bs. His own dad trying to buy influence into the healthcare decisions of our baby.

I was going to just let it go but that crosses so many lines I can't keep quiet. I haven't drafted my email yet but he will be hearing from me. I cannot believe he thought he could buy our child's health. He took moments that could have been lovely and turned them shitty when explicit, proper boundaries were set in a very healthy manner. 

Anyway, just wanted to update you since you are all too familiar with this kind of behavior. 

As a side note, birth SUCKED. He was almost an emergency c section bc he's so big and was turned sideways but my doc is old school so he got him out with forceps (after more than an hour of pushing and two failed vacuum attempts). I'm glad I avoided a c section but holy crap. It feels like my pelvic floor was run over by a tank üò¨

"The Shinning is definitely a great movie with masterful cinematography and an amazing soundtrack. My problem with the movie is how the characters are represented. 

Nicholson played Jack as if he was insane before the his arrival at the hotel. 
In the movie Jack kinda just goes crazy between scenes whereas in the book it is a very gradual decline into madness. It shows how the hotel slowly gets a hold of Jack and he is too weak to fight it but he does get moments of clarity. Wendy is a much more developed character in the novel and I don't think Shelly Duvall played her character correctly. Danny is kinda the same in both but his ""imaginary"" friend Tony is more than what is shown in the movie. "

&gt;One thing a lot of people aren't even talking about is the fact that the Raiders just traded Cooper. That's going to leave targets on the field for other pass-catchers. Richard is a pass-catcher.

is definitely a part of my rationale for why I think Richard is more valuable than Doug Martin. As it was, Marshawn would still have some dud games if the Raiders fell behind quick, which I wouldn't be surprised to see happen more often now that they've just lost Cooper AND Lynch. 

So at best, Doug Martin will be a shitter version of Marshawn Lynch, and at best, Richard will pick up some of Amari's targets and split some more carries with Martin. At worst, Martin sucks, but Richard probably maintains the same numbers as before. So Richard comes out on top here IMO.

But here's to hoping I'm wrong lmao."

"They should do something where casual PvP keeps the rules as they are now and competitive gets vanishing step back on combos (not more Ki or cards just the vanish after four moves). Without vanishing step coming back from offense the game is turn based and stats matter a lot more than skills. The reason we didn‚Äôt freak out too much early on is because there were only a handful of sparkings and they were very comparable. Piccolo and Broly were considered by some to OP if that means anything. The characters now are way way too powerful to be played the old way; powercreep will basically completely invalidate every old unit (Look at Goten, Kid Trunks, and SSJ Gohan compared to Scouter Vegeta, SP SB Blue Goku, and Pikkon and you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm talking about) because they just won‚Äôt have the stats. 

I‚Äôm having flashbacks to Hard Mode Radditz when I fight a high star Hybrid Team- it‚Äôs literally impossible for me to win unless I get lucky and get my rushing rushes off first and correctly. With vanishing step if I play well enough they might never touch me so their overall 40% higher damage, health, and defense could be overcome- if I have to slug it out with them I‚Äôll lose unless I get lucky. 

Side-step gave me a chance to win against ‚Äúbetter‚Äù teams because vanishing step regen makes every encounter like the start of the game- mind games, cancels, and good play will get you into a combo and you‚Äôll be safe from free retaliation after. It‚Äôs a neutral contest after a neutral contest (it was an actual fighting game on mobile) - I like lowering combo damage (4 cards is cool) but vanish needs to come back. "

"10k is a fairly substantial amount, I don't think anyone would fault you if you took the offer. That being said, is offer a lateral move? Are you moving from associate to senior? Is the firm around the same size/ranking?

I would do my due diligence in your situation and gather information from people that I can trust. Consult a friend or peer in the firm that extended you an offer and try to figure out how management is or what the workload is like. Consult a senior in your current firm that you can trust and get their opinion on your situation. Figuring out the unknowns is the best way you can make a decision."
"The tournament rules make it more competitive - in your home games you only care about who wins so the loser will throw a game to stop someone from winning twice in a row. In tournaments the score matters, so getting from 5 to 7 points before the leader gets to 10 can be make or break for getting through the playoffs.

Also - randomized cards with numbers at the frequency of dice rolls instead of dice can ensure that the number 10 isn't just straight up better than the number 9 in any one game, which is what can sometimes happen with dice rolls."

I've talked to a couple people that play video games with their SO and Skype each other while doing so. Find what works for you.

"I graduated HS in 2004 so things *might* have changed now, but they broke the day into four roughly 96-minute blocks with a 15 min break between 1st and 2nd and our 20-minute lunch periods spread out during 3rd. Of course, that was 20 minutes total--to get to the cafeteria, through the SINGLE line for 300+ students, find a seat, eat, and get back to class. I ended up bringing my lunch and eating part during my break and the rest during lunch, and I was still had stomach issues from having to shovel my food down so quickly. We didn't have any sort of study hall or free period.

It was worse in elementary school--my mom came to a few lunches where parents were invited to eat with their kids, and she said we'd regularly hide our cookie or fruit in a napkin and smuggle it out to eat in class because we just didn't have a long enough lunch period (it was maybe 25 minutes, but again the issues with getting through the lines and actually eating)."

"I was talking about the act of creating the build, but for build design itself, it changes by a ton from sl10-120.

Before sl50, everything good is a vigor-gouge build. That means raw, fire, and deep are practically relevant. Estus is also too strong compared to total health and damage output, making fights more about attrition than pressuring. That, combined with some early-game defenses/resistances stuff, makes elemental damage and auxiliary effects even more deadly here.

From sl55-sl90, pretty much every single-discipline build (+dark) can be comfortably built, but elementals will usually need to have low requirement stats. Strength is actually relevant here, as you can afford armor but not elemental infusions.

Past sl100, physical builds become entirely obsolete. Due to how split damage works, even for high requirement weapons dark infusions will actually significantly outpreform. This is also the place where you can delve fully into two trees, such as a strength-faith build with both end-game miracles and &gt;40str ultras. IMO, meta level is when you should start putting quotes around ""build."""

"TigerUSF has it nailed pretty good, I'll just try my take on it: 

So, basically a big sales tax? Maybe 50% added to the top of all products sold would do the job?  
If people then start just making their own things at home, then we'll need to increase sales tax even higher (say 75% on top of goods sold?) or will the public be forced to buy things and not be allowed to make their own?

This just becomes a big merry-go-round for tax increases and would create tons of havoc till it would be sorted out. Not saying it wouldn't work - but it would have it's difficulties. 

A. People would not be allowed to do their own work at home or make their own things (this would be tax evasion) Tax evasion would be dealt with heavily - maybe deportation from the country?

B. If you do not prevent A, then how do you prevent everyone from making their own things? Eventually they could all just buy an expensive new (not-yet-invented) 3D printer that can print everything that you need - just insert raw earth and it converts into anything you need. 

&amp;#x200B;

A distopian future (of a sort) could easily be created by this economy. You don't dare make your own items/food (tax evasion) and you need to make sure that your employer is legit and paying his taxes or you'll be charged with tax evasion (if he reports you as a sub-contractor instead of as an employee)

Can you guess how most companies would handle employees? As sub-contractors, and the ""employees/sub-contractors"" would need to do all their legal paperwork or be charged with tax evasion or for not properly filing their business.

The rest of the talk is about the PS4 engine, BTW; the stalling that's mentioned *is* happening on the PS3 engine, which had no concept of yielding or preemption. (Ah, the costs you pay when you're writing your own scheduler).

I still have no idea what point you're trying to make about RPCS3's performance characteristics.

"Exactly what I've been saying. Fortnite was, is, and will always be that lighthearted Battle Royale game. Yes, building adds depth, but its no ultra competitive esports game. Epic is supporting esports for fortnite because they know there is a portion of their players that really want it and it will grow there game, but they're still holding back because they know fortnite isn't the right game to properly be an esport.

I'm not saying OP should give up their dreams of being a competitive fortnite player, but they should understand Fortnite will always put Fun over Competitive. "

If there's a job you should be doing it.

"You assume it was someone on the right or left. Maybe it was someone whose family was killed in an Obama admin drone strike. Maybe it was an anarchist. The fact that so many are jumping to the conclusion that it was am American conservative (and white???) is troubling---especially when most of the groups who are doing so, like CNN and Reddit would decry there stereotypes like assuming a Muslim is the culprit whenever a homosexual is attacked. So nice work jumping to conclusions based on nothing and calling it ""reality."" I for one hope the culprit is found. But before this sub puts another ten minute timer on me replying, honestly, try asking yourself this: if you were a far-left wacko who wanted to false-flag conservatives, would you do so ANY differently? No injuries or deaths, the Targets are all household name top Democrats, the bomb/packaging look like they were assembled by an idiot (stereotypical stupid Drumpf voter can't even spell the name of the guy he wants to blow up amirite), and it happens at a time when Democrats need to convince voters that Trump is hateful and bad. Now I don't know who did it and I definitely do not go around saying it is a false flag--because I don't know! But looking at all this, do you at least see why it is FEASIBLE that this is a false flag? And if not, again, I implore you to tell me how a false flag would be different."

"Regarding that, MS has streamlined production now for maximum efficiency.  So they should be able to extract better profit from each unit sold.  

For example, instead of a 50"" surface Hub, plus a 84"" surface hub, they made a 50.5"" modular hub, that you can link up to four panels to get something as big as 100-200"".  This would also help with maintenance, and replacement units, and repairing single panels quickly.  Even the processor inside will become modular.  

So MS has only one SKU to make, and it will end up saving them vast amounts of money down the road.  

As for Surface Studio 2, there is no need for tons of research and development expenses, as the desktop is as close to peak perfection as possible for such form factor.  They got rid of the i5 processors, so only have to build i7 models.  

For the Surface pro 6, they got rid of the core m3 model, and focusing on two models.  

Most of the Surface lineup's manufacturing is now streamlined, and the ecosystem is being perfected iteratively.  "

Dollar cost averaging works both ways!  (I keep telling myself.)
"I'm sure you can consider outliers in every part of your argument. Pay particular attention to the lifetime earnings.

&gt;[https://trends.collegeboard.org/education-pays/figures-tables/lifetime-earnings-education-level](https://trends.collegeboard.org/education-pays/figures-tables/lifetime-earnings-education-level)   
&gt;  
&gt;Note: Based on the sum of median 2008 earnings for full-time year-round workers at each age from 25 to 64 for each education level. No allowance is made for the shorter work life resulting from time spent in college or out of the labor force for other reasons.

There is a much larger distance between the median and infinity and the median and zero. That would be like the median net worth of a restaurant being a billion dollars because a deca-billionaire is eating there.

I haven't examined the sample data to analyze quartile data regarding specific earnings and I'm going to leave that to you, if you choose to do so. The real question here is what is in the best interest of the average citizen, considering that we're not only paying for substantial portions of the burden, but the condition of the markets are subject to debt ratios and, just like auto and home loans, can catastrophically collapse over a dozen shitty quarters regardless of whom is at fault.

Considering credibility is regularly measured objectively in the educational system and the hiring process, we can skip the theatrics of higher education and create a leaner workforce that doesn't spend the best years of their lives as indebted wage-slaves while simultaneously testing the architectural limits of a fundamentally questionable financial system like King Kong climbing around the empire state building.

Switch axe has no defensive capabilities you will need to rely on evade window or evade distance amour skills jewels and dodge on point for all incoming attacks. 


Charge blade has a nice balance of offensive and defensive capabilities but it has a learning curve and will take quite a few hunts to grasp the more tricky mechanics such as guard points.

"Had my first ever on site with a big n on Monday. It was with Microsoft for a new grad software position. I thought it went well. The technical questions were pretty simple and I solved them and gave a good explanation. (two sum, merge sorted array, queue). I think I struggled with some design questions. I was asked to design tic tac toe and a jukebox. Was not expecting those questions but I worked well with the interviewer to solve it. Got rejected this morning. 

Honestly feeling kind of down. I don't know, I thought I did well. I'm graduating in April so this kind of felt like my last chance to get one of these jobs before then. It feels like there is a lot of luck involved in getting these jobs but maybe I'm just making excuses. I only had one internship before and I didn't think I learned that much while there so maybe thats why I didn't get it. Oh well, it was a cool experience and I definitely know what to expect now. "

"So... he, the father, can't and won't even commit now, and gets pissed at bro because he won;t commit? Daaaaaaamn the hypocritical levels are off the charts!

I told my brother the same, a few weeks ago he just told me ""if sth happens to me and my wife, you'll be the guardian of our kid"" because ""I wasn't gonna get married or have kids anyways."" I'm slow to anger so it took me a good half day to process this and I called him and very angrily told him NO (also proceeded to chew him out).

If my brother, his wife, her brother and sister, her parents and my parents were all to croak, AND he got life insurance beforehand, I'd take the kid. Otherwise fuck them all. Then he had the gall to say it's because ""I'm more responsible"" (my cousin wanted me to be godmother of her kids, she has 5 siblings!!!) FUCK THAT YOU JUST THINK I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO THAN CARE FOR YOUR DAMN KIDS.

So good of your SO to stick to his guns. Don't them guilt trip him or you in this shit. Irresponsible brother isn't even dead, I bet he thought by getting his bro to agree to that shit he could dump the last bit of responsibility as a father he has."

Actually bro let me give u a scenario where u redeem yourself... For yourself.. for your own humanity. First off let me say this. What u did wasn't even that bad. But let us not pretend it was for blackmail u prob watched one too many videos of a lad shooting out webs on to their sleeping sis ass bro. That's HOT. But u gotta take full responsibility sit your parents and you sis down and tell them the whole truth then put your head to the ground and apologize and say I understand exactly what I have done and I am at your mercy. You don't understand it now but that is the most courageous and the hardest thing u can do now. And it will heal you the most. More deception and more trying to get off Scott free is fuxking so bad for you as a person. U must face this head on and with courage and do the thing that makes u the most vulnerable to fully redeem yourself. And u might not understand it now but if u somehow get out of this without facing down your shame directly and voluntarily... Well that's a direct path to becoming a full blown pedophile. Do u understand? You have a choice now. The choice to either be a coward and further kill your character or face it honestly without fear like a warrior. When u are a kid u don't understand the importance of good character. But it's everything. Trust me. If I were u I would overshare the truth and throw myself at the feet of my family. Trust me bro if u can do that then u can turn this crazy situation into a very positive experience and that's the only way anyone will respect you. And even better.. u can put this shit behind u stop worrying about it.. fully accepting the consequences is incredibly liberating. U won't have to worry anymore. U can move forward. U can be the man u are (or girl or whatever u identify as my friend)

That is 100% legal for that man to do that, up until you tell him to stop. Then if he doesn't now you can charge him for assault or something along those lines. 

Your analogy refers to a completely public space. Tinder, pof, bumble ect... are all private areas of the internet like a private room or house. Think of it as going to a friend's house and they had their dick out. Its completely different than walking down the street and a guy waving his dick around. "

"Napanood ko sa vlog post ni Maricar Reyes at Richard Poon:

&amp;#x200B;

Isa sa pangit na culture ng mga Pilipino ay yung Financial Dependency. Lumaki ang marami sa atin na sinu-sustain at pinag-aaral ng mga magulang ang mga anak nila, para kapag tapos at nagkatrabaho na, ay bubuhayin na sila. 

Mahirap ito lalo na kung may pamilya na ang anak nila. nagccause ng conflict kapag hindi nakapagbigay ang mga anak kasi 'obligado' sila magbigay. Masakit man isipin, pero this culture is pulling us down. 

Dapat kapag magkaka-anak na tayo, palakihin natin ang mga anak natin na maging financially independent. Ang goal dapat ng magiging anak natin kapag nagttrabaho na sila ay yung makapag-ipon for themselves and their future family. Now, tayo naman, dapat nagttrabaho tayo para isustain yung sarili natin hanggang pagtanda natin. 

&amp;#x200B;

In your case, magbigay-bigay ka. Hindi naman advisable na maging madamot sa magulang. Okay na magbigay pero hindi mo dapat maramdaman na obligado ka kasi mawawalan ka ng gana magtrabaho. Kausapin mo sila. Sabihin mo na pinag-iipunan mo ang future mo. Kaya mo yan. "

"Wow uh... I'd redo that list entirely IMO. 

OT - 1950s cheese. Over the top adventure. Nothing NEAR Sitcom laugh tracks, that's an insult IMO. If you need laugh tracks to queue humor, your humor sucks (and yes I'm aware that I'm also bashing Big Bang Theory... sue me...)
The OT is modeled after 50s war movies and adventure super heroes like the Flash. In 1976, ANH felt like a glorious 1950s film of yore but with 1970s aesthetics.

PT - 1990s childrens dark cartoon cheese. The corny dialogue is so... so cringy. However it's also dark, edgy and deep. It feels made for 12 year olds, a lot more so than the OT did. Watching the PT takes me back to 90s childhood epics like X-Men or Spiderman, Batman Animated Series- great shows that had mature content despite clearly being for younger audiences. 

ST - A self aware cash grab. It feeds on nostalgia hype so much that a lot of it feels incredibly forced as if the films scream at you 'you wanted more props!? You hated PT cgi!? Well here have alien utter tits and green milk! HAVE AN OBLIGATORY CANTINA SCENE with dozens of costumes! ALSO watch us literally rehash OT scenes as if we thought we could do them better than the original!"" The cheese in the ST is it's self awareness and often over the top Marvel silly humor cheese. Its actually near the child like cheese of the PT despite basically dishing the PT constantly.  Where it does try to add adult depth, it feels terribly inconsistent because TLJ was so different compared to TFA. The the Rose / Finn kiss for example was UBER CHEESE.

"There are a few issues I have with this post.

1) We still don‚Äôt truly know what causes it. It has been suggested that gay people exist because they offer an evolutionary advantage. That might be a stretch, but who knows? And it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre at risk of not producing enough humans. In fact, we‚Äôre closer to having the opposite problem.

2) If it is a mental disorder, then what? What‚Äôs the cure to this mental disorder? In order for something to be a disorder, it must cause significant disruption in someone‚Äôs life. The negatives of being gay come from society‚Äôs response to it, not being gay itself. As of right now, we already know of one cure, and it‚Äôs to accept it and let gay people live like everybody else.
If we tell gay people they should wait on a scientific cure that may not ever exist, what should they do in the meantime? They can‚Äôt just not be gay. Should they be celibate? LOL, never going to happen. Should they enter sham relationships/marriages/families that are built on a lie? That‚Äôd be a huge disservice to everyone involved.

3) The entire meaning of one‚Äôs life should not be based on some biological rulebook that may not even exist. If nature wanted us to follow these rules, it shouldn‚Äôt have also given us a brain that is capable of pondering the rules and following its own. 
I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm certainly not going to waste the only life I‚Äôll ever have by not pursuing the things that actually mean something to me."

"I promise this is relevant: most bees are sterile.

Only the queen bee and her drones have the capability to bear offspring, and the drones only exist to inseminate her at the beginning of her adulthood. The workers in the hive have a zero chance of passing on their own genes, but they wouldn't have evolved all these behaviours they have if it didn't help their genes to spread.

Worker bees cannot become mothers, but they can become aunties. Once a new queen is born to the old, her daughters will be the nieces of the old hive's workers. In this way, the workers' genes are passed on in part. Evolution still works on bees, and it favours traits which help the queen spread her genes. That is why bees feed the queen and nurse her young.

Gay people might be like worker bees. They'll never pass on their own genes (unless they live in a culture that makes them reproduce, ew), but they can increase the viability of their nieces and newphews (niblings) by helping their siblings. And humans are all about helping family. Gay adults have nothing to give their children, but they have a lot to give their tribe."

"Yeah sure man it's my pleasure. I'm really hoping more people get on board with this in the future so they can hopefully reap the same benefits I have. 

I haven't really noticed a difference between buccal and sublingual, but then in this case, they're almost like the same thing. I mean usually what I would do is, I would let the piece of sub dissolve into my saliva, and then I'd sort of swish it around to coat as much of the inside of my mouth as possible with it. So in a sense it's both doing it that way. 

Intranasal I only tried about a month ago and I was pleasantly surprised to discover it actually works better than sublingual by a fair margin. It seems to kick in slightly faster that way, like it maybe takes the effect 1.5 hours to peak versus 2 hours for sublingual (you might not notice this if you can't get high on it, but this seems to be the case, that it takes that long to peak). Also it seems that the bioavailability is higher, you can use probably 40-50% less to get the same effect, so in my case, instead of using 1.5-2mg to get high with sublingual, I only take .7-1mg to high intranasal. 

What's weird is I was warned that doing it intranasal would cause more of the naloxone to get absorbed and might cause precipitated wds. I believe maybe it is true that more of the naloxone is absorbed, but IME, it's certainly not enough to cause prec wds. But still something to be aware of, as it might not work the same for everyone. 

The naloxone is what I believe causes much of the retardation of tolerance. I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but it seems with all kinds of different agonists, by pairing them with a small dose of antagonist, you can greatly slow down tolerance, without noticeably affecting the initial high either. 

What I do to take it intranasally is this: So I have this little vial I took from chemistry class, just like the one in [this photo here](https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/29/why-fentanyl-is-deadlier-than-heroin/). In the vial I have a little piece of cotton. I drop the little bit of sub of want to do in the vial, and then add a bit of water, maybe .3-.5mL, with my trusty oral syringe, then I use the syringe to mix it up to get it dissolved. I suck up half the solution in the syringe for each nostril, stick the barrel in, right up to the point where the nasal sinus narrows, an inch or so in, I cover the other nostril, and then as I squirt the liquid in I also inhale gently, to make sure it doesn't drip down out of my nose. 

Feel free to hit me up with any other questions :-)"

I wear the Treatment for casual days and feel comfortable going out with just the Treatment, concealer, and maybe some powder foundation. It's sort of thick, clay-y and hard to spread so I don't wear it under normal foundation. Instead I wear the Camo Drops day to day (like to work or parties). I don't feel like it corrects as much, but the formula is nicer to use. I'm not convinced yet it makes a huge difference after I apply foundation, so I still need to do some tests wearing different things on each side of my face."

It's been a while since I've played S2, but if I recall, Mutilate's wording was something along the lines of ""Sets the target's health to 1"", whereas in S3, the wording is ""Deals damage to the target equal to 100% of their maximum Health.""  Since the updated version actually deals damage, it is indeed affected by Zonte's damage reduction.  Oh well, thanks for the suggestion!"

"Somehow I missed this question, sorry.

The public response was complicated for a lot of reasons. One was the fact that though the first H-bomb had been detonated in 1952, and news had leaked out of it, it hadn't been confirmed by the government until 1954. So the news was in a state of an odd uncertainty ‚Äî it was technically old news but it was also new news again. This seems to have diluted what might have otherwise been a strong response, on par with the editorials and whatnot that had followed the H-bomb debate of 1950. 

Second, the Bravo detonation was announced only because it was also a radiological catastrophe. Initially the US only announced it was an ""atomic device"" and gave no hint as to the nature or yield of it. But a bit over a week later, after the Japanese fishing boat Fukuryu Maru arrived in Tokyo and set off the Japanese fear of radioactive tuna, the issue was on front pages globally: the US had set off a multimegaton weapon and unleashed a torrent of fallout.

On the whole, I haven't found a lot of response one way or another. Editorials of the period didn't praise or lament, but they did wring their hands. The uncertain status of the knowledge seems to have robbed it of its ""immediate"" status, making the H-bomb just another part of a growing dread about the state of the nuclear world."

Like how asexuals don‚Äôt experience sexual attraction which is basically a desire  to have sex with a person based off of appearance, aromantics  don‚Äôt experience the desire to be in romantic relationships or anything romantically inclined, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they are repulsed by romantic relationships or the thought in being in one.

That being said, while video games can be appealling to all types of people many use them as an escape. When something changes the rules of their fantasticescape world, all their anxieties of reality funnel here.

 There's a level of immaturity and disconnection from life that has brought forward this negativity. 

 In my experience most of the people here are processing a lot of things and their discomfort  lingers in their jokes, opinions, and social interactions. If you have a strong heart then you process whats going on for them ahead of time and nudge them in the right direction and that is payment enough. The people who have the energy and the wiring to provide unprocessed thoughts are more likely to access online hubs like these because they feel their happiness depends on it. 

Some of the comments are right, you'll find this everywhere and that most people are generally unhappy, but the problem isnt what we communicate but how. 

This has been the only game ive been playing for a year (or since it been out) as ive been working towards my masters in social work (what i run from haha). This is the first subreddit that I've regularly followed and the first game ive ever been tuned in to on its developments.  But over the last four months I've begun to lose interest and the biggest reason why is because I realized that this version of the community is mostly 17-25 year old entitled boys who are learning what its like to be a champion/leader without acting noble or virtuous. You're right its a negative feedback loop. 

I usually provide solutions but i dont have one. I'm satisfied with my experiences in the game and i know now that cognitive biases are in every community; people don't like not knowing things, people aren't patient when trying something new, and as much as people ask for it, people are terrifingly repulsed by change."

"Garnet USB is decent but since you need an astra, ASB or P.Blink you're not going to have room for a dedicated entruster or Kain, IMHO. Elarra can generally solo heal with even a decent magicite deck (I don't have any blade/spell wards in mine yet and she does fine, just two dampens). Given that the fight will go kinda long I expect you'll be able to build up SB gauge over time to fire off the USB without CSB downtime, though.

Quetz will provide enough damage to break Water Rage with a good deck and a decent chain count, ~20 or so is roughly my minimum with Garnet CSB up with 2x Empower 15, 1x Empower 10 and max Magic stat. I'd expect you want to break at least one water rage with Ashe during the 10 second downtime between resummons, may have to sit through some time with the rage up.

I would personally start with:  
Garnet - MM  
Ashe - Damage+  
Elarra - DMT  
Palom/Onion  
X  

X needs to be someone with Astra / P.Blink. SSB0 Edge is great in that slot, likely run him with Garnet's MM and give her Ace Striker and Vali. BSB Ace can also do weill with a CSB up.

Palom vs. Onion is a kinda hard call. You do not need the magic at all from OK, I'd run him with damage+ and use the USB whenever you can fast cast it from Elarra for the EX Mode and fastzap, and Onion can carry some decent utility on slot two like Protect, Shellga, Hastega or even Mental Breakdown (which could help punch through rage). But with a CSB active Palom BSB is absolutely absurd when hitting a weakness thanks to the instant cast. Start with Onion if he's dived, I guess.

If you have Desch SSB that may honestly be worth running, his BSB isn't really great but the imperil actually can be. Geo has barthunder but I don't remember how often it comes out in a longer fight, Quetz can wipe the first one and eventually the second, if it's ever more than that you're going to start hitting a neutral element and loosing 50% of your SB generation."

"Kind of. A Brutal Critical bonus die only happens on crits so nineteen out of twenty cases, the Greatsword will still deal more damage on average. Yes, an average of 6.5x2 +6.5 (total 18.5) puts the Brutal Critical Greataxe ahead compared to 3.5x4 +3.5 (total 17.5), but only on a crit (something like 1/20th to roughly 1/10th of the cases). It takes either a crit chance of over 1/3 (two non-crits giving Greatsword 2x0.5 more damage vs one crit giving Greataxe 1 more) or more Brutal Critical dice for Greataxes to pull ahead. Mind you, the difference is small and risk seeking behaviour exists - people play lottery or go into casinos *despite* the low chance of winning."

"While I get your point, the probability of success was much larger than you are implying. 

First, Musk with all his failings, is a great executor and M3 is his next big challenge after more than a decade of Tesla's challenges. And he comes out on top EVERY SINGLE TIME. I abhor his 'funding secured' and 'pedo' tweets but he manages to move his companies towards their goals briskly. 

People are always being myopic about Tesla's achievements, forgetting that if you see in the long term, Tesla is single-handedly changing the auto landscape. You might not bet your money in Musk's support but you would be an incredible fool to bet against him.

And finally, coz EV sector  is still growing, there are HUGE untapped efficiencies still to be unlocked. Investors and a huge number of analysts are always looking at quarterly data including expenses and margins and extrapolating them to arrive at grossly erroneous figures. For example, margins for a 35k car would be zero if not negative according to Chanos( a great guy btw). But dude, how silly is that calculation? Battery pack prices are falling every quarter.( Read some reports that avg fall is ~25-30% per year). And after EVERY ramp, Tesla has managed to streamline production and improve efficiencies till they are stable.

All I'm saying is, you don't need to be Nostradamus to see that Tesla is moving quickly towards their goals. I'd rather be sitting on that train rather than standing in it's way."

"The staff generals had serious doubts about the plan.  However, the Kaiser and commanding generals just had a belief that things would work out.  After all, in the wars of German unification, there was always one sharp battle, the other side folded, and that was that. In essence, there was a thought that if the French handled things well, the plan would fail, but that they had a shot of France bungling things and encircling or trapping its armies, in which case it would all work out. Excessive optimism, in other words.  

For the British, the British army wasn't all that big in 1914 and it would take time to get them to the battlefields and in place - so it was a gambit that by acting quickly, they could wrap the whole thing up and be home before Christmas (and before the Brits really got established). 

In reality, everything started going slower than they expected (including a slower penetration of Belgium), and a faster than expected Russian mobilization and attack on the east, which required them to transfer troops from the western front to the east. 

The other major factor is that Russia was in the process of upgrading all its rail lines and increasing its industrial power.  The Germans also thought that their position would be worse off every year in the future, and so since Austria-Hungary was ready to fight (which meant Russia had to deal with them too), 1914 was as good a time as any to fight (since it would be an even worse time in 1915 or 1916). 

Obviously, what they didn't consider enough that it would be even better if they *didn't fight at all* and just mobilized as a defensive measure and told Russia not to attack Austria-Hungary and they could remain at peace, and also encouraged Austria-Hungary not to start a war with Serbia.

"The West Memphis 3 conviction almost entirely rest on the police prejudices against the metalhead and a questionable co-conspirator confession.  There is zero physical evidence linking them to the crime.


There is a mountain of physical evidence against Steven Avery, even if you eliminate the questionable co-conspirator confession. ( For the record, the nephew should not have been convicted.). The defense theory implies that all this evidence had to be moved from a second crime scene, and that the police are willing to let a murdering rapist go to frame a guy that 20 years earlier, before most of these people where cops, was wrongfully convicted.  And hope that no evidence comes up that contradicts that she went to his property, met him, and was never seen again. 

Carter, it been a while, but the movie and song make crap up out of whole cloth.  Multiple eye witness have details that match Carter and the accomplice.  Evidence that he didn't amounts to He's successful (he wasn't by that point) and the cops didn't like him.  (At best, they like him no worse than any black person in 1960s Jersey.)

Adnan Syed was convicted with cellphone data that, if somewhat questionable when ""Serial"" came out, is better explained now.  And a co conspirator who came forward without police prodding has understandably smoothed over the lone inconsistacy in earlier testimony.  There has never been any reason for the co-conspirator to act as he did.  In fact, he acted against self interest."

"*SPOILERS*


The story goes big boss enters a coma after mother base is destroyed. He is in a coma for 9 years. In those 9 years kaz founds diamond dogs. He also recruits ocelot. Being 1984, the afghanistan war is at its high point. The mujhadeen have been fighting the russians for a few years. The mujhadeen are CIA backed (honey pot being the stinger missle system that ended russian air superiority) and Diamond Dogs were hired to aid the insurgency. During a standard operation, kaz's group gets ambushed, captured and killed. 

Skullface was former Cypher member. As cypher had wiped his village out, skullface has a chip on his shoulder. Eventually he and cypher parted ways and skullface wanted revenge. He found himself working ''for'' the russians during his hunt. He had interest in bipedal tanks, paranormal, and the ideal human. He worked on a plan destroying cyphers perfect (english) world via his parasite program. He found his way to big boss and kaz as they were the last known to have contact with cypher.... considering paz was dead. 

Eventually you find out you were in cyprus due to kaz and cypher working out a deal.... which explains why skullface captured kaz"

Starcraft screen is a roll up style that retracts.
Keeps bugs out, more natural light and nice cross breeze.

If roof, then the odd counter space above fridge makes a great place for a 3 drawer Sterlite plastic shelf. We put one up there when onsite. 
Without much storage it helps for longer getaways.

"I was SO bummed leveling during BFA. I've been using the armored raptor that matches the mount since they became available in Pandaria.

Troll expansion full of dinosaurs? TWO pets?? Double armored raptors?!? I was so fucking stoked.

But now raptors are cunning and that family seems to have absolutely GARBAGE bonuses. Speed increase? Not haste, but movement speed? WHo gives a fuck.

And if I ever pulled more than 1 enemy, we got spanked. Pet died in like 3 hits even spamming Mend Pet and using the full heal ability. 

Learned that Ferocity is the needed family. This is the first time my pet choice has EVER been controlled by gameplay requirements and I hated it. Luckily I'd tamed Thok so I was able to keep my armored dinosaur fantasy going, with my raptor as my second pet, but I'm still salty I couldn't level with double-raptors.

Now that my ilvl is over 340 (barely, I'm a casual, lol) I can use whatever pets I want and survive, but the raptors are still noticeably squishy compared to Thok and compared to themselves in Legion.

And the change to cunning makes no sense! Raptors are smart but they're vicious. Ferocity always fit them better. And they were Ferocity in Legion.

Also really miss the stamped glyph. I don't care about all those random garbage animals. I want MY pets to stampede. No idea why that glyph couldn't be re-added like Fetch and Play Dead were.

All the other big complaints about BFA don't impact me much because I don't care about min-maxing or being top DPS. I just want my animal chaos playstyle and I'm salty it's been dampened for no good reason."

Our politicians, ALL of our politicians, are not helping.  They don't get along.  Don't reach across the aisle, and nothing gets done.  There is no compromise.  Regardless of the issue, it is THEM stopping US.

The media takes the hate, amps up the crazy, and spews it to those just mentally unstable enough to think, I can fix this, I just need to protect US from THEM.  Was the person who sent the pipe bombs a right wing nut job?  Probably, almost certainly, but they are encouraged by the 24 hr ""news"" cycle that exacerbates peoples fears and emboldens them to act.

We will never win a fight against hate, its too powerful, and you can't take it out behind the chemical shed and shoot it.  

We need our politicians to start acting like adults, stop the hate, and vote for what is best for their constituents over what their party tells them to do.  It shouldn't be a political death sentence to vote against your party, and the companies that ""donated"" to your campaign, if its the best thing for the people you are representing.

The media needs to stop spinning up the hate and making US look at THEM as less than human.  At that point there is no hope for THEM and it is up to US to fix things.

I think the other guy explained this even better, it's not life or death in the moment, more of a creative process whose output gets verified."

It's often fun to optimize the character and then work backwards and figure out the in character reasons for them to be optimized. In fact I find it a little weird that someone would play D&amp;D and not optimize to some level. there are other systems that are more freeform that could let you play those characters. D&amp;D isn't really designed for you to play characters who are bad at what they do.

" In my humble opinion, what has driven big corporations to make more money and good earnings was related to the bull run we had in the markets and the non-existent interest rates. Now that interest rates are going up, big investors are shifting their money away from stock into bonds. Now the big bull run we had in the past 10 years was heavily related to the large number of retail investors getting into stocks. Retail investors got richer and thus, had a bigger buying power. This permitted big corporation to sell more. Now that we are entering a bear market and interest rates are higher, retails will lose money, and big corporations won't meet their guidances. The revenue won't be met. It will further down the market. I might get bashed and instulted from redditors. I don't care i'm just here to give my opinion. "

"I hate that portion of fans that overreact to JP. Wanting Jesse traded?? He‚Äôs looked decent next to Leon, and now Leon and Reider has confidence and can build off this game. I think that 2nd line can really develop something. Mclellan has just gotta get Leon and Jesse to set up chances more and use that deadly shot. I can‚Äôt stress enough how the first half of the season will be a slow start, and then a roller coaster until we get to the second half. The reason being, is that our team is slowly progressing. People were complaining all off season about how our roster still isn‚Äôt good, and yet are some how surprised by this start. We have really built off that Jets game and are 3-1-1 after that 0-2 start. Talbot rebounds from last game, Draisaitl, Reider keep their confidence with JP and they start developing chemistry, McDavid does McDavid things, and the bottom 6 keeps playing well, and I think we have a chance to start something like another streak here.

"A little too complex, may slow gameplay as players may need to read over the full effects of the Battlecry.

In terms of the armor in the lower right corner maybe you could try using X instead of 0, that way it would be more consistent with your use of X on the Tendrils and in the Battlecry.

You say you're sprinting, but what you really need to start with is a pace so slow you barely feel like you're actually running at all (but do a running motion, don't walk). If you still can't get to 60 seconds, then that's your first goal. If you can do 30 seconds, do that 30 seconds, take your allotted break, then do 30 more seconds, or 35 if you can push it. Next time you try, go for a little bit longer. Once you get day 1 down, feel free to do it more times than required on the plan... Maybe you do four of the day 1 workouts, maybe you even do two full weeks (six runs) of that. Then you move forward!"

"‚ÄúA bit of blackface‚Äù huh? I understand the entirety of your argument but suggesting that blackface should be tolerated because the gesture is ‚Äúhonoring‚Äù African American culture is a disgusting fallacy. Blackface was invented by poor white people in the south who sought comedic entertainment by humiliating blacks through minstrel theater. They would paint their faces black and apply copious amounts of red lipstick to make their lips look disproportionately large to their faces. The performers would enact scenes that reinforced extremely negative and often falsely stereotypical behaviors of African American traditions and culture, many times likening blacks to monkeys. Since it‚Äôs culmination, the act of blackface has served a single purpose: to humiliate black people by mocking their physical attributes and cultural history. And we are still witnessing the demonizing affects of blackface today because idiots like you lack the mental capacity to recognize just how demeaning something like this is. Don‚Äôt ever, EVER, try to tell me or anyone else that blackface is acceptable, under any circumstances whatsoever."

Also, during last console generation at the time when PS was outselling Xbox, xbox still outsold PS on all multi-platform games.

Or to put it another way, if you had a person with an xbox and another person with a playstation, the person with the xbox, on average, will spend more on gaming and play more games.    


Part of the statistics/proof were in the revenue generated.  Last generation Playstation lost a LOT of money, but Xbox has been consistently generating billions in revenue (with exception of the post x360 release and the RROD warranty/refund fiasco.  They weathered that storm and have been in the red ever since).  "
"I'm single now but in the past I've had a few longer relationships that were pretty normal and successful. At the end of the day, communication is what it always boils down to. Every relationship will have arguments and strong, negative reactions to them. For people with BPD, these reactions are extreme. It's therefore essential that you take time and space to return to a baseline normal. Only after you've cooled down is there any hope in having a discussion and finding a solution. 

My ex-boyfriend and I took to solving fights through writing. We would argue, go our separate ways, cool down, and then discuss our fights by email. It may seem a bit strange, but writing forced us to think carefully about why we were upset (sometimes this helped me realize that I was in fact being totally ridiculous) and also gave each of us a chance to fully explain our side without the threat of interruption. This ensured that we each felt ""heard,"" which is an important step in conflict resolution. Might be worth a try if you think your partner might be open to it."

"With your very specific problem, adding no extra complications, you could probably spend a bit of time and write a really nice efficent function that gets the correct answer. 

However even with this problem there are things to consider: What if the graph has loops? How do you detect and avoid going in loops? What if some nodes aren't connected? How do you confirm this?

But often when dealing with these problems you want to add more complications, like what if you can only travel 1 way, e.g. from Jenny to Sarah but not from Sarah to Jenny. Or what if you want to include distances, e.g. James and Baker are 1 mile apart, but Jenny and Sarah are 3 miles apart. NetworkX can handle all these situations!

I remember I started reading it right after I learned to write my name one gloomy morning. While reading Dracula, I asked mom what the tough words meant. Mom showed me how to look it up on the red dictionary that we had. As for how I learned to read, I have no idea. It's one of those things that probably were taught to me while I still wasn't fully conscious or maybe I've just forgotten. I just knew the alphabet and how to pronounce most words. I do remember mom making me read everything on the road whenever we went out, from sign posts, commercial billboards, to movie posters. Dracula definitely reminds me of my happier childhood days and that's why I love it (plus, I wanted to be like Dracula - Classy, Suave, The Boss).

"I will suggest three:-

a} [Warehousing](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/anoyomouse/Warehousing).

It will initially seem to you that the point of this mod is purely standalone storage; but this is not the case.  The real benefit is the fact that I can drop two 6x6 warehouses, surround them with steel furnaces and inserters, leave three spaces open next to each warehouse to belt in ore and coal, and belt out plates, and get 500ish iron plates per minute.  That probably isn't much in the minds of a lot of people, but it is a lot more than I can use.

b} [Factorissimo2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2).

This mod allows enclosed factory buildings, which you can walk into and build inside.  They are good for both space saving, and for keeping everything seperate and organised.

c} [Miniloader](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/miniloader).

I know I suggested Loader Redux in my earlier post, but I find these are better because they are smaller, so it's possible to use them in tighter spaces.  These are 1x1 machines, like inserters, but they input and output a much larger quantity of resources at once.  I mainly wanted these because even when using fast vanilla loaders, I generally can't keep assemblers running at full speed.  With these I can."

"&gt;The google memo is, unfortunately, a completely embarrassment from an academic point of view, and says way more about the author than anything else. An engineer with an expertise in biology is not an authority on sociology, and he gets tons of stuff wrong.

The contents of the memo itself are not nearly as important (to the point I was making) as what it was responding to. My point was that affirmative action was taking place (regardless if Google was calling it that or not) and the memo opposed this. The response, Google firing him for speaking out against such a practice, shows their belief in affirmative action (which is equality of outcome). 

&gt;The Vox article you cited talks about both ideas, but doesn't argue specifically for equality of outcome. Just says that equality of opportunity is (rightfully) impossible to measure in practice, and the only way we can test it is by measuring outcomes, which sort of blurs both concepts.

While it doesn't explicitly say that equality of outcome is what we should implement in our society, it is certainly in support of it. For example, ""The difference is that while equality of outcomes promises gains for every poor person, equality of opportunity explicitly leaves some people out."" This sentence is clearly in support of equality of outcomes, making the idealistic claim that equality of outcome will be beneficial to every poor person. 

&gt;I still don't see anyone arguing for obtaining complete equality of outcome. Even one of the Marxist maxims ""From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs"" is clearly not about equality of outcome. Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzQZ_NDEzVo

The video makes the point that the term equality can vary depending on the context. In the context of our conversation (and the beliefs of the radical left), equality is typically about the minority and diverse groups one might belong to. 

Coming back to affirmitive action, let's take a look at the Engels quot in the video. ""The living conditions of Alpine dwellers will always be different from those of the plainsmen."" In affirmative action, it isn't denying that there's a difference between men and women (Alpine dewellers vs plainsmen). Instead, it's arguing that the differences of one of those groups is justification for hiring them over the other, not necessarily their merits. 

&gt;And Peterson has explicitly said ""I want equality of outcome for incels"". Wasn't he against this idea, like you?

Again, context is very important when talking about equality. The biggest criticism of Marxism is not desire for equal society (that sounds great, and I don't think any decent person would deny that), the problem is that path to that equity. This conversation with incels is talking about the idea of enforced monogamy. Enforced monogoamy is talking about the idea of single-partner relationships being *naturally* and/or *socially* enforced, not by the government or tyrannic power. This is the big difference between what Peterson was talking about here, and the idea of equality of outcome through a change in government and corporate policies.

There was little incentive to chase. The faster.knockback looks weird, but what it does is that the attacking  player doesn't have a lot of time to respond and think of what to do next while the defending player will be able to respond sooner. Basically everyone is playing the game more and are not just stuck in the knockback animation. It's probably the best change to ultimate over 4"

"Your argument has nothing to do with God's existence.

You are talking about curiosity and using science to proselytize. Nothing wrong with that - but at least be honest about what you are arguing.

When you say that there must be a prime cause and we need to determine the prime cause, no atheist has ever argued against research to determine the prime cause - this is the entire premise of science and why it exists as a discipline.

What theists do is to proclaim the conclusion first - the prime cause is God - with little to no research into the universe at large.

You have already determined what the prime cause is, therefore you show no curiosity as to what is actually out there and you don't research where it all came from (reading the bible does not equal research into the cosmos)."

As for anything else, most of it just comes down to flavor text and the environment they‚Äôre playing in. Which it seems you‚Äôve got planned pretty well. 

One suggestion for a quest idea, that is sort of iconic, is the train heist. Maybe they have to protect the train, or maybe they‚Äôre the ones doing the heist. Either way, railroads and steel/iron industry should probably play some sort of role. 

Maybe you could also include a montagues and the capuletes type rivalry between families in a town. 

I suggest watching some old westerns to get more ideas. 

Edit: I would avoid using a Native American analogous race. Simply because there are a lot of ways that can go poorly if you try to make them have the same culture. You could probably get away with orcs or goblinoids being natives to the land and being forced out and hunted/killed. But I wouldn‚Äôt make that races culture the same as Native American tribes. Make it unique and distinct and you should be fine."

- lack of access to basic information because libraries are gone and internet providers block whatever the hell the want

- a healthcare system that sucks more than our (USA) current one.

- lack of adequate drinking water

- an even worse criminal justice system that favors the rich over the poor

- remember that whole global warming thing?

"As the number of attacks have been gone over:

bonus to attack rolls: +9 (BAB) +3 (dex) +4 (bow enchantment)=+16 as a baseline.

Situational modifiers: +1 (point blank shot), -2 (rapid shot), -3 (deadly aim), +4 (bullseye shot).

damage: shortbows have a base damage of 1d6, gravity bow bumps that up to 1d8 (which is on average +1 damage per hit.  Not really worth using unless done before combat tbh, as an extra full attack will bring a lot more damage than buffing with gravity bow will).  Frost enchantment adds in another 1d6.

Flat damage buffs: +1 (str) +4 (bow enchantment)=+5 damage per hit.  Situational modifiers: +1 (Point blank shot), +6 (deadly aim), +4 (focused shot)

So, if he has gravity bow up already, he has two options for his round.  For both situations I will assume he is within point blank shot range, and is using deadly aim.

He can use bullseye shot and focused shot together to make a single attack at +18 to attack, which deals 1d8+1d6+16, which averages to 24 damage.

He can make a full attack action, which if he uses rapid shot will consist of 3 attacks at +12 to attack (the first of which does damage twice if it hits), and one attack at +7 to attack, each of which deals 1d8+1d6+12, which averages to 20 damage.

Running the numbers, the only time where option 1 gives better average damage is when the enemies AC is somewhere between 31-34.  If it's 30 or lower then the full attack is better (and if the AC is 25 or below the full attack averages of twice the damage of option 1), and if it's 35 or higher the full attack is again better.  And even when option 1 is better it's by a rather marginal amount, and the damage output is so small that the character probably shouldn't be trying to fight in current conditions.

This means that bullseye shot is more or less a useless feat, and focused shot is really only useful on the turns where he has to move and thus only has his standard action left (and in those cases it's not really the biggest boost anyways.  Something like weapon focus would probably be better as that also helps during the full attack)."

"I was a young 19 year old, living a fit life in Aspen, Colorado. I worked in a ski shop owned by legendary ski Olympian Stein Ericksen. His old Norwegian friends would come and visit, get their skis tunrd and hang with the young bucks.

They would drink aquavit until 3AM, get up, grab first chair at 8:30, and ski balls deep tree powder all day long, at 12,000 feet.

"I‚Äôm honestly blaming 3/4 of the new orgs for not putting in effort to their roster selections and marketing...ruining the level of NA teams imo. Also, rookies and academy talent aren‚Äôt properly developed. 100T was a great pickup, but OpTic, Clutch, and Golden Guardians didn‚Äôt do jack shit. Only C9 actually utilizes their academy for talent development and such...they brought Licorice from eUnited, who was a notorious playoff choker...like Goldenglue. Now, Licorice blossomed into the best NA top laner (outperforming Ssumday, Smeb, etc.). Goldenglue now has a good laning phase, which he hasn‚Äôt previously shown. Zeyzal‚Äôs talent was nurtured. This is why C9 succeeds when other teams could not...they take newer talent and mold them towards their needs. When CLG took in Stixxay, they had success at MSI. TSM took Biofrost, and they proceeded to dominate NA and give Samsung a run for their money. IMT kept Cody Sun around, and he turned into a late game machine on 100T in spring. Even AnDa‚Äôs done well for himself at Worlds. EU‚Äôs national leagues do well in helping foster talent, and academy league will also help with that"

"My point is that simply having players in a game means absolutely 0 income for Neowiz.  It actually costs them money to keep servers up and running.  So for *any* F2P game, you must have ways to get players to spend, and spend constantly.

Bless Online will have the few White Knight supporters who will spend money.  You'll probably see a few more players buy convenience items and boosts.  And you might even see loot crates give an income boost.  But unless you have a larger playerbase, chances are Neowiz will bleed money to keep this game running.

Right now, there's more of a chance that Bless Unleashed will do better because of it's better game engine.  But it's unsustainable to have other Neowiz games prop up lower revenue ones.  You're just cannibalizing profits at that point.  Keep in mind, Neowiz closed it's Asian server, and Asian gamers typically spend more on microtransactions than Western ones.  That's either a sign that this game is bad, or management is inept."

"Arguable there is no reliable source of protein either. When people say ""vegan protein"" it's usually in the form of a processed powder or tofu. Protein powders are a suplement. That's it. They supplement a natural source. It's not supposed to be the other  way around, but vegans are forced to make a supplement then foundation. Then there's tofu which is equivalent to a vegetable cheese. The difference between animal cheese and tofu is that tofu actually has a chemical that blocks the absorption of calcium. There is evidence that long term, heavy consumption of tofu can actually cause serious calcium deficiencies (makes sense, it's like anything, you eat to much of one thing and it will have negative affects on you). Then vegans talk about nuts. Well for roughly ever 200 calories of nuts there is roughly 9 grams of protein. Even if your entire diet consisted of nuts, you would still be below the CDC recommended 0.68 grams of protein per pound of body weight that should be consumed per day (at least for me, a realitively muscular and lean male...and that number is at the low end for those who weight lift or perform other muscle intensive activity). 

This doesn't take into account how carb and sugar heavy a vegan diet is....but that's an issue for another day. 

I know there is the occasional vegan athlete who is no doubt in better shape than me...but the strong majority of vegans look malnourished or plump from a fructose based diet. "

"I genuinely enjoy the conversations I have with the women that work there. I get to talk to a beautiful woman, knowing I can relax and be myself because there's no expectation on my end that the relationship between her and I will last longer then when I walk out the door. And a lot of the time, I can have really deep or intense conversation on topics we're both interested in, maybe get a lap dance or two, and there's no expectations of anything else. They don't judge you, and sometimes, they even give you preferred treatment if they like you and you come back. I'll always remember my favorite stripper, Sinful. I did have a crush on her I'll admit. "

"Don Rich had such a fun persona, and complimented Buck perfectly.

*From Wiki:*

On July 17, 1974, after finishing work at Owens' Bakersfield studio, Rich was killed in a motorcycle accident at the age of 32.

Reports indicated that Owens had pleaded with Rich not to take his motorcycle that day and had been pleading with him for years to quit riding.

Owens was devastated by Rich's death and did not discuss it in interviews for years. 

In a late 1990s interview, Owens said, ""He was like a brother, a son, and a best friend. Something I never said before, maybe I couldn't, but I think my music life ended when he died. Oh yeah, I carried on and I existed, but the real joy and love, the real lightning and thunder is gone forever."""

"Thank you for demonstrating that you don't  know how vaccines work.  

What happens is that there are some people who -- not by choice I want to emphasize -- can't be vaccinated.  They rely on herd immunity.   They rely on the population not being infected in a benignly.  They are so weak or ill in other ways that getting even a trace measles infection will kill them.    The vaccination will threaten their lives because anything that makes them a little weaker will threaten their lives.  Most people who get vaccinated don't notice that they went from 100% full strength to 99.5% because loosing a little sleep does the same thing to us.  

Well, those people who rely on herd immunity, when there are people wandering around who didn't need to be infected, they are now threatened by those people who choose to become a Typhoid Mary.   

Typhoid Mary was quarantined for life.  She never got typhoid herself, she just infected people around her.   Society can't allow idiots to volunteer to murder other people.   If you don't want to be vaccinated, then a lifetime quarantine is what society needs to impose on you.  "

"UPS is a reliable option, in my area at least. They always ring the doorbell and wait at least 2 minutes before they leave. Purolator rings the bell and leaves after less than 45 seconds. Sometimes UPS and Purolator arrive early and ring when I'm still asleep, so that 2 minutes is really important for me in those scenarios, and I'm sure it's important for thousands of other people as well. You don't want your customers to be aggravated by your shipping option, even though it's not your fault that Purolator is trash.

"That exists to an extent already with killing PvP elite mobs for twisted realm portals to get currency to buy epic gear. Because it's not a path of least resistance + requiring you to pre-own epic gear nobody does it.

There's the same problem in your suggestion as you point out in the first half, it's either good enough nobody touches dungeons, players/bots flood the maps covering all channels farming or a waste of time, items rare and also not in demand. There's also players creating identical looking items if you take the cosmetic uniqueness approach with monster drops and the issue of grinding being less popular than it use to with the younger audience that'd also disadvantage busy ms1 fans now that most are adults.

"This advice is spot on. A lot of the newer courses have highly bumpy greens rather than flat ones. Sometimes sharp elevation change from lower to higher will also produce a similar effect, the same as when the landing point is on the fringe - except with these, the path trail deviously does not change.

In your case, you circle around your landing point looking for the path trail to extend/flick out or retract. If it does, reduce your topspin and choose a closer landing point. If the path is maintained, you should be good to go. This is the risk of the full topspin method. I've been of the belief that using natural spin and allowing for the wind produces a more consistent result with a high accuracy club like the EB. But to each their own."

"Go for it then. But do the math - a dispenser shooting bone meal onto a bamboo plant uses one bone meal per bamboo, at least twice per second even with a slow redstone clock.

How fast is your mob grinder? How much time are you spending converting those bones to meal and loading it into the system? If you need a ton of bamboo quickly, it makes sense to save up a bunch of bone meal and use it up making a ton of bamboo. But why? When you can make an automatic farm that produces it slowly, but with zero inputs or effort from the player?"

Certainly, if you can't build a club up from lower levels, and if there's no domestic transfer market, then starting a football club with an academy is a non-starter.

"A long ass time ago I made a verduran enchantress deck and my turns were very much like this if they let me put out 2 enchantresses.  When I first started playing that deck everyone would leave them alone because they wanted to save their creature kills for the ""dangerous"" creatures.

But after witnessing the deck steam rolling them after getting 2 enchantresses out, they always killed them on sight.  And it kind of ruined the deck if the enchantresses died.

But basically the deck was full of enchantments so once two enchantresses were out, I'd draw like 2-4 extra cards a turn.  If all 4 were out, I'd go through 50% of my deck in a couple of turns. It was awesome."

Fucking barrels of it.
"AOL was a company that allowed people to connect from their home computers to their computers, which would show them an interactive display with things like news, dictionaries, comment forums, games, chat rooms, and so on.

Yes, yes, **a lot** like the Internet. But it *wasn't* the Internet. All of the stuff you saw when you got on AOL *came from AOL,* on their own computers, in their own networks.

At first there was some very basic Internet service available through AOL, like Internet email. Most people didn't use it, at least not at first. Most people who wanted Internet email would have a dialup shell account or something else. And you couldn't, like, connect to Skype or Steam or any of the things you can do now (never mind that they didn't exist then, that's not my point.) So it wasn't Internet service, and AOL wasn't an ISP.

At first AOL would pay people, like Webster's, or CNN, to allow AOL to share their information over the AOL network. But at some point, AOL got so popular, that they realized that they were actually doing those companies a *favor,* and one year suddenly went ""you know how we were paying you? Well, instead, now we want you to pay *us.*"" And they did. 

There were other similar companies around the same time in the early-mid 90s. GEnie, Prodigy, Compuserve, even QLink. Eventually these started all being referred to as ""OSPs,"" short for ""Online service provider,"" to differentiate them from ""ISPs,"" short for *Internet* service provider, because AOL etc. didn't provide Internet access -- if at all, it wasn't directly like you typically get it now -- but access to their *own* network.

The introduction of the World Wide Web, the passage of Al Gore's ""National Information Infrastructure Act,"" the opening of of commercially available internet access, especially with direct-access dialup technologies like SLiP and PPP, started to change the dynamic. In fact it's not too unreasonable to suggest that the attitude people had in the mid-to-late 90s towards the Internet is pretty close to the attitude people have *now* about the Dark Web -- a cooler place than the one you've been using that few people really know how to get into. 

So ISPs started to rise, and at first they were independent companies, often ""mom and pop ISPs"" which served a local area, mainly still over dialup lines. And they did very well because they made it a lot easier for regular people (i.e. not college students, college professors, or military contractors) to access this uber-kewl Internet.

As a result, AOL had to change tack a bit and start actually providing Internet access more directly. But they *still* focused primarily on their own access portal, their own connection software (often sent to people on floppy disk or CD-ROM, as junk mail, which is why they have a reputation for flooding the world with useless CDs), made their own deals with content providers, and so on. 

Eventually the only people using AOL (and the other competitors had long since died) were people who couldn't figure out how to use the regular Internet. As a result, they got a really bad rep because they were typically very unfamiliar with Internet culture and norms and capabilities.

In the end, the ISP model won out (although the ownership model didn't -- there are really no mom-and-pop ISPs anymore, being replaced by traditional telecom operators, like telephone and cable TV companies), and AOL pretty much ceased to be."

I assume a javelin would be considerably heavier than an arrow, and while they were often thrown with the use of a mechanical aid (such as a throwing strap), I have no frame of reference for how hard a javelin might hit relative to how hard an arrow might hit. Javelins were used for a long time in a wide variety of military contexts, so presumably they had their advantages and appeals. Was the penetrative/capacity for damage one of those advantages? I know of medieval Spanish and Irish sources that both describe javelins being thrown through shields and armor to kill or injure the person beneath them, but I am unsure how much of that can be ascribed to the poetic conceit of the authors involved."

"As someone who just graduated last May and is now at a top 10 PhD program, and had a pretty mediocre GPA (well under 3.9), grades probably aren't that important. That being said, I didn't get into any of the schools ranked higher than mine, including UIUC. However, it's not clear that I would have even with better grades. I think at that level, you really need to have done some great research and published a paper or two. If you have that, most likely, GPA will be irrelevant. If you don't, GPA will be important, but will only get you into lower ranked schools. At least, this is my understanding from talking to PhD students."

"The oil wells start at 100% efficiency, then go down towards 20% of the starting production depending on the amount of production cycles it's completed. The total amount you get doesn't depend on how fast you get it, there is no loss in having wells idle.

&amp;#x200B;

On the general topic: Ratios aren't really important when doing oil only the dynamic between the three output of the refinery matter. I find the easiest way to deal with this is using oil cracking setup with circuit network controlled pumps.

If you set conditions that prevent cracking from eating up your full storage, it's just a matter of adding chemistry plants until it balances (roughly, as long as nothing is full while others are empty it's fine), then add more crude until you have something of everything in storage.

&amp;#x200B;

Until you get advanced oil processing, you can add tanks whenever storage fills up. After that you wont really need more than one of each."

"Posted from a similar question I answered:

With scorch, try avoiding taking people head on.  He is most destructive when he can flank. This means though that you know the maps well so make sure you know your routes.  It‚Äôs also important in general to avoid open parts of maps as you‚Äôre at big disadvantage out there.  Stick to tight areas and corners you can hide behind.  

Against Scorch specifically, if I can flank them I will throw traps around him and flame wall the traps and ideally him as well.  I then save my thermite shot to hit him when he tries to move out. Feel free to mix it up though.  

Unless he is very low on health I avoid flame shielding another scorch.  Because he will just flame shield you back and you lose a lot of health. It basically becomes who has more health wins at that point.  

All other titans though, if you can surprise them, I apply flame shield liberally.  It‚Äôs his most destructive weapon for sure, so use it when you can.  

Finally, make sure you know when you‚Äôre taking damage.  Many new players just don‚Äôt realize they are taking damage and get hurt very badly.  Note the damage markers and turn and face asap or dash away.  

Hope that helps, lmk of any questions. "

"Realize that for the most part women aren't paying to watch some dude jack it.  That's going to be other dudes.  As long as you're cool with that then go do some homework.

Looks to me like most of them are getting around $100 to $150 which aint bad for something you were going to do for free anyway.

I'm not an expert at that stuff but my understanding is you make your real bank by getting regulars who want to watch.  If you're good at flirting with that crowd and you've got the looks i think you can do ok.

Vivir, con unos $50 USD diarios te la pasas muy a gusto. Puedes rentar cuartos y pagar el estacionamiento seguro de tu automovil con solo unos $10 USD al d√≠a. Incluso menos. puedes comer en las llamadas Cocinas Econ√≥micas unos $3 USD por comida. Al contrario de los EEUU, puedes usar el transporte p√∫blico con mucha facilidades, tiene sus inconvenientes pero ahorrar√°s mucho.

&gt;¬øHay ciudades que sean particularmente amigables con los estadounidenses blancos que intentan practicar su espa√±ol?

Ciudad de M√©xico, Guadalajara, san Miguel de Allende, Quer√©taro, Can C√∫n, toda la Riviera Maya.

&gt;¬øAlguna de las ciudades / zonas que deber√≠a evitar?

El Norte del pa√≠s, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Tabasco, Michoac√°n, Morelos, en esas zonas a los gringos les ven cara de DEA y pueden ser algo agresivos. En CDMX la zona norte y oriente.

No requieres licencia mexicana, pero puede que necesites un seguro para el auto, y como dije antes un Seguro M√©dico de Viajero. Si vienes a Ciudad de M√©xico, puedes vender tu auto y pasar por Mexicali o El Paso usando autobuses de Greyhound que te traen hasta la Ciudad de M√©xico o Guadalajara.

https://www.hospedajesolyluna.com/ o https://es-la.facebook.com/cuartosamuebladoss/en Ciudad de M√©xico, que ya tienen servicio de internet, hay lugares aun m√°s baratos. pero debes buscarlos ya estando aqu√≠.


&gt;¬øAlgunas ideas sobre c√≥mo ganar dinero mientras estoy all√≠? Definitivamente voy a intentar conectarme a Internet, estar dispuesto a hacer trabajo en l√≠nea o posiblemente conducir para Lyft / Uber si existen (otra raz√≥n para traer mi auto)

Puedes buscar trabajo, si hablas ingl√©s y espa√±ol, puedes buscar en lugares tur√≠sticos, por eso la Riviera maya es muy buena para ti. otra es que entres como garrotero o mesero en restaurantes o taquerias grandes. para trabajar en UBER necesitas tener licencia mexicana y pagar impuestos en M√©xico, estar con visa de trabajo en M√©xico, lo cual de seguro no vas a poder obtener. Puedes entrar como simple turista y tras pasar los seis meses de esa visa, seguirte, aqu√≠ no hay redadas, y tras pasar ese periodo puedes pedir una regularizaci√≥n migratoria para extender tu estancia e incluso obtener la residencia legal e incluso ya pagar impuestos y trabajar de forma regular.

Por [este](https://www.gob.mx/tramites/ficha/regularizacion-migratoria-por-tener-documento-vencido-o-realizar-actividades-no-autorizadas/INM792) o [este](https://www.gob.mx/inm/acciones-y-programas/programa-temporal-de-regularizacion-migratoria-90502) camino.

"Aren't the demons demons though? Like, from hell? I think the only thing separating the goblins in GS and the demons in DOOM is the fact that the demons exist on a separate plane of existence from people. They *couldn't* attack people in our world if they wanted to because they don't have the means to, but if they were as plentiful as goblins then I'd be willing to bet they'd do an equal amount of murdering and pillaging

Obviously the villains in the scenario are the people who want to harvest Hell's energy and keep opening portals to it, and bringing demons to a world they're not supposed to be in, but I guarantee you the relationship between the Doom Slayer &amp; his people (mentioned in the lore) and the demons of Hell was very similar to that of the people and goblins in GS.

That said, DOOM doesn't even try and play any kind of ""who's the *real* monster here"" card, it's very up-front about demons being crazy and evil so you feel no regret ripping and tearing. GS seems like it's trying to push a bigger narrative with more characters and such, as opposed to DOOM being just about the Doom Slayer being a big bad murder machine, so I think the idea of a bad race that's super evil isn't inherently awful but it needs to be in the right place."

"&gt;I mean, existence itself is a hint. Since nothing exists without a cause in our reality.


Wrong. Existence itself is not a hint. All you are doing is moving the goal post to God. Which then you have the question what caused God? So you don't exactly answer the question of existence since it started before us which just speaking this example your God, so what caused God? Furthermore, we do not know what caused the Big Bang. Just because we don't know what caused the Big Bang does not mean we should assume God.

You can disagree with it if you want. You will be wrong every time you make this silly claim. I am not going to argue with you the definition when anyone here who cares about a honest discourse will go by the actual definition of atheism. Not your disingenuous belief.

"Greed often stimulates competition, competition improves technology, products, services, sciences and therefore the general wealth of people. The majority of medicines, are created by big pharmaceutical companies with profit in mind, but improve our life style and quality of life.

Then again, to much greed is bad as it creates monopolies which are generally bad for society, and creates a society where caring for each other is non existent. However, you should consider the fact that nature is inherently ruthless, evolution is literally the strong survive and the weak die off. Without competition and a certain amount of greed, animals would have never evolved."

As you get older, and your responsibilities grow, you realize that a team, whose allegiance that you cherish was handed to you by birth or geographic location, who does not actually give a fuck about you besides your economic contribution to them shouldn't dictate the happiness you have during the 2/7ths of the week you have to yourself. My friends and I get together on Sundays at the bar and drink and become despondent as we get our shit pushed in like the Ravens game, and this happens year after year. All while we have real life issues as middle class Americans that get worse and worse with massive growth in real estate, education, and child raising costs while wages remain stagnant, while conversely they get paid millions to play a game.

Yeah, if I want to go mow the lawn, or play a video game, or watch NASCAR instead of watching us lose by 30 with the statisically worst offense in the history of DVOA, or whatever that that ridiculous stat was, then that doesn't make me a bitch. Living in Michigan and Arizona for a while, we're a fucking laughingstock for our long-term ineptitude, and that's saying something considering they have the dogshit Lions and Cardinals.

that being said, Chris doesn't have as much canon to draw from, but I'd put RE5-era Chris at rough par to current 616 Punisher. it'd mostly come down to a question of who wants it more, and nine times out of ten, that's going to be Frank. an in-character Frank wouldn't kill Chris if he knew anything about what organization Chris represented, though."

You clearly feel that the entirety of those countries deserve to die because a few of their members are bad people. You feel that all of them must be sacrificed for the good of mankind.

I (and others here) feel that your view is rather evil and thus you should be sacrificed for the good of mankind.

"What is the context?

Don‚Äôt really have a ‚Äúresource‚Äù for this, but here goes:

Xs (left) and Os (right) are air conduction (AC) thresholds, measured from headphones or foam insertphones.

The brackets [, ], &lt;, &gt; are bone conduction (BC) thresholds, measured using a bone conductor. If done properly by a competent audiologist, you don‚Äôt need to worry about the difference between [ and &lt;. The ‚Äúmouth‚Äù of the bracket always opens towards the tested side. 

If the BC is worse (larger numbers) than 25dB, that‚Äôs a sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).

If the AC is worse than 25dB and also more than 10dB worse than the BC, that‚Äôs a conductive hearing loss.

If it‚Äôs both, then it‚Äôs a mixed hearing loss.

If AC is more than 10dB worse than BC but both are still 25dB or better, we usually report that as hearing within normal limits but with an air-bone gap (ABG).

Google turns up these, which look ok:

When other kpop group release a song in English, SOME Armys shout: ‚ÄúSellouts! Pandering to western market‚Äù

But when its BTS, Armys go: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre artists &amp; its their choice to sing in English or not.‚Äù

Realising that this song will be in English may allow other fans of other kpop groups to call out Army‚Äôs hypocrisy. Its like those Armys who has used this rhetoric are now forced to swallow back their own spit I guess.

Regardless, Yusuke's ability to ""recharge"" his spirit gun isn't a strict 24 hours and *poof* more ammo, it's a general guideline of ""with some decent rest usually by the next day they'll be back again, more or less.""

His emotional connection is that Yusuke has far *more* power than even he himself believes. He only has ""five"" shots because he holds back, unwilling to access the wealth of power within him until his back is against the wall and he doesn't have a choice. When he's fighting for survival or fighting for his friends' survival - not just hypothetically, they're literally dying in front of him - the emotional walls he's erected within himself aren't enough to stop the spirit energy from welling up inside him.

So it's not like his batteries get recharged when he's emotional, it's that he's got several spare batteries in his pocket but he doesn't like to use them because he's got both mommy issues and daddy issues."

Precisely.  I think you are spot-on in your response.  My confusion, perhaps not properly explained, is that I made it clear that $X was what I needed to want to move companies since I am worth X.  They went lower than that salary but exceeded my requirement for 1 year only.

I briefly mentioned that this new companies benefits are worse, worse that average for the industry.  I included that in my calculations + a premium since they head hunted me, not me applying.

It just seems that they should immediately think ""Wait, he said he must have X to do this, we offered him more than X but for only one year and then after that he gets less than X.  This would incentivize him to find a better offer within that year therefore we are paying more than we want for a person that won't stay long enough for us to fully get a return on investment"""

"honestly: you tell them absolutely nothing.

you let her know the day that some burly family members show up to help move your boxes.

if MIL says your SO is going to kill himself, you do not say ""oh no, i should stay"". you do not unpack boxes. you do not get out of the u-haul. you do not drive over there. you do not even continue to be on the line if it's a phone call.

your response should be and ONLY should be ""oh no! let me call the professionals to help immediately!"" *and then fucking do it.*

right now she's carefully keeping your SO in a pit of misery and wants you around too, because ""well he doesn't beat you and that's as good as it gets"". quite frankly, even though i'm a bleeding heart who thinks that some people legitimately are not cut out to work the daily grind and they are still hold tremendous worth, even when it's ""just"" something as ""simple"" as depression keeping them back, i am pretty suspicious of your SO at this point too.

**you cannot fix your SO. he needs to fix him. with professional help.** MIL wants you to stay because she wants you to keep setting yourself on fire to light SO's way, while intentionally casting shadows so mommy's dearest always stays at home.

your proof is that she thinks her son is suicidal, but is not interested in getting him *professional help that would be effective*. no, she's *just busting that out as a manipulation tactic against YOU*.

also?

don't let her know your new address. (fuck it, i'd say don't let HIM know your new address, EITHER. one thing, he might let it slip to mom. but i am also not exactly coming out thinking he smells like roses here. if he's serious about loving you, he'll be absolutely fine with a few months of 'let's meet for dates in public places and talk on phone/etc only'. if he balks at this idea, BE VERY WARY. if he balks at this idea and starts whining about how he doesn't know how he's going to get his sexual needs satisfied, FUCKING RUN because there is your proof that he doesn't want a romantic partner, just a warm sex doll that mommy can feel free to boss around.)

don't move out alone. have some rather strong people helping you haul boxes. do not rely on SO here. show up with people who are solidly in your corner one hundred percent, who have never met MIL before, and who do not hold an ounce of sympathy for her. **i hope that i am wrong, but just in case, in summary? SHOW UP WITH BOUNCERS AND BODYGUARDS.**

this goes triple if any of your possessions are things that MIL uses regularly - from televisions to computers to fuckin toasters. it's pretty obvious that she wants you around as a convenience to use."

"The purpose of fiction is not to prove to you that themes are true; the purpose of fiction is to make you *feel* that themes are true. I would argue that feeling a truth is more important than understanding it.

Here is a good example: anyone who cares to look into it will find copious evidence that [being kind to others makes you feel good.](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS757US757&amp;ei=fBHRW4eMAazYjwTtnq-wBA&amp;q=does+being+kind+to+others+make+us+feel+good&amp;oq=does+being+kind+to+others+make+us+feel+good&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...31951.31951..32779...0.0..0.141.141.0j1......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71.yC6VxZq0iWU) So, if everyone knows that this is true, why aren't we always kind to each other? My answer is that we aren't always kind to each other because it's not enough to know that it's true, we have to feel that it's true. In fact, the most successful form of psychological therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy) is entirely built around exercises built to make you feel as true what you already know to be true. It's only after we feel this to be true that we can act on it.

To bring this back to literature, one of my favorites is *Lincoln in the Bardo*. Before reading it, I knew that I could help people by loving them, but after reading it I *felt* that truth much more strongly, and I began acting more lovingly as a result.

So, no, themes don't rigorously prove anything. But they do something similar, and it's either equally or more important."

"I commented in /r/autism the other day about this same topic. My experiences so far have been positive, but I've only disclosed to 4 people, and they're all very close. I am terrified of trying to explain myself to friends who haven't known me as long or with whom I'm not extremely close, or to family members who are very unpredictable, or to anyone at my college. I wish I could talk about this with a therapist, just to get it out of my head somehow and feel heard, but the wait to see a counselor at my school is 4 ‚Äì 6 weeks at present and I don't know if I could get the courage to tell them anyway, which is no good.

To address the question you asked in your post‚Äîall 4 people that know are neurotypical. (Mom, dad, older sibling, partner.) And for what it's worth, they are trying so hard and it shows. My relationship with my dad, in particular, has gotten stronger, and I think that part of it is that now we are on more equal footing‚Äîsmall things and big things that have caused misunderstanding or hurt in the past are re-contextualized now. It's no longer a constant feeling of fighting to communicate and feeling ignored; we both understand that we have different experiences and different needs and we can try to bridge those gaps together, instead of putting it all on one person or the other. What I want to say is that it can be okay, or better than okay.

"You're definitely right about Luci being Lucifer. Another thing you'll notice is how he's the only demon without wing (sorta like a ""fallen"" angel...) In addition, when Bean is exorcised, King Zog says ""the sparkle in your eyes is gone."" According to mythology, Lucifer is called the ""Morning Star"" or ""Light Bringer"". If we're assuming mythological roles were the same, Elfo would be the sun god (or Ra) and Bean would be the Sky goddess (eye of Ra), thus Luci being the star (or sparkle) in her eyes. I also believe that Luci is probably in love with Bean, but doesn't say anything (you'll notice he's the one killing all her hook ups). Side note, notice how the bad things that Luci pushes Bean into might not be the best for pleasing her family, but is for the greater good. "

"&gt;Yes, and sane. Stop equivocating with your ""stricter background checks"" line. Anyone remotely learned in rhetoric sees right through it. You're embarrassing yourself

What's embarrassing is you fighting for a recreational activity when the body count in this country goes up every year. Shame on you. A rational human being wouldn't defend a recreational activity in exchange for human life.

&gt;Excuse me, what? You mean a few people shot about once or twice a month at schools? Hey, you know what might stop that? Armed guards.

Excuse you. Stop downplaying DEAD people. You're mentally ill. Armed guards? Like the one in Florida that was just an accessory. You think people are going to risk their lives for a measly wage. You think people are not going to shoot innocent students while going after the assailant by accident. WRONG solution.

&gt;No, this is not a chance to do something about it, and you know it.

I already stated on multiple occasions this will not prevent mass school shootings. This will however, lower them. Just because something is not a wholesome solution, doesn't mean you sit there and do nothing with your thoughts and prayers.

&gt;This is why people are constantly worried about you fuckers dragging us onto a slippery slope; that's what you fucking do, demonstrably.

What fucking slippery slope? You think the government is going to fuck your life? You're already being fucked demonstrably by the economic inequality in this country. Everything down from crime to your college loans is affected by it. You're worried about a slippery slope with a giant elephant in the room? You're living in an alternative reality. Your right for a recreational activity is a fucking joke. The constitution is not a bible and amendments are and should be changed by article 5. Don't like this reality? Get out of America.

&gt;I'm a college student in the US. I've been to two colleges. One of them, we actually made a plan 

Good for you. You know what's better? Never having to use those plans.

Generally when people with swords go ""convert or die"" people generally convert. It doesnt mean many werent legitimate, but at the same time how likely do y9u think it was that the majority were? 


Hell, the Rus famously converted to Christianity rather than Islam, because Christianity let them drink.

All of them are likely not Christian only because of their parents, but it likely plays a very large part.

&gt;Out of every christian I know they ALL point to design in nature whether their parents were of the religion or not. 



Yes and humans frequently gravitate towards things that agree with their worldview. It doesnt invalidate the worldview, but it does bring how compelling the arguements are into a degree of question.


&gt;Lol... Thats the whole point of quoting Chinesesources. You can't claim their parents were Christian and thats 70 million in the last century alone.



Yes and its still 5% of their population. Even assuming all of them converted to Christianity without familial impentus, that still leaves 95% who didnt. 




&gt;If you knew even 5% of what you pretend to know you would know there were hundreds of countries that were only effectively evangelized in the last 150 years. 

There are 195 countries. Where are you getting these ""hundreds"" from? 


&gt;The whole point of missionaries was to bring the message of the gospel to people whose parents were NOT christians.



Yes. And its generally a one time deal. Once a community is converted, theyre probably going to pass it down to their children. 



&gt;now back to the subject of this thread. Don't think I don't know you want to go off in another direction entirely because you nature argument is crumbling.

"I'm around your age and did it last year. It's so hard at first. The holidays are especially tough, so be especially aware of your feelings and do what you need to do to take care of yourself. Go to therapy if you can, watch out for triggers, and do stuff that makes you feel loved and connected to other people (e.g. meetups, classes, clubs). And start saving money so that you can be on your own two feet. I'm still a total mess, but much less of a mess than I was last year. It gets better. "

"Agreed that this class combo is quite strong. It also allows for one to take Paladin early for proficiencies/an extra attack if that is desired.

Something to keep in mind with this build is that to get Divine Shield requires 13 Base Strength and two feats \[Power Attack, Divine Shield\]. If this is not your cup of tea, the stock standard Sorc 38 Pal 1 Monk 1 arguably can focus their efforts a little more into spell casting , even if they end up wearing Heavy Armour.

It's also worth noting that with high-quality Dodge AC boots and Epic Mage Armour, Divine Shield may not end up providing that much at level 40. Sun Soul +5's \[the cap for standard NWN\], EMA, Haste and Normal MA is already +15 AC towards the +20 Cap. Other modules might have introduced Dodge boots beyond +5, which further reduce the effectiveness of Divine Shield.

That said, Divine Shield does allow for the Boots slot to be freed up for other boots, such as Dragon Slippers or Striding Boots \[if available\], and still attain high Dodge AC. So there's pros and cons.

I think because every doctors style is different (some prefer patients to bring their own, some see is as weird), it‚Äôs hard to know what a doctor or an ER attending prefers. I‚Äôve done a million tests and most of them are silly or routine or irrelevant to my current condition. If they were to access my electronic history of testing, I think a doctor would just get super pissed off. I keep a binder with the most recent, relevant stuff to the appointment I‚Äôm going to. It bothers me that so many doctors prefer you to do this yet there‚Äôs this feeling that it comes off weird or suspicious. One of the annoying hypocritical things about the medical system imo. "

Because the whole thing is under an evergreen tree, I need to use shelves so I have space for everything.

Sure you'll draw some nonlands, but if your deck is designed to curve up from turn one then odds are good you'll be able to cast something for each of your post-MLD land drops. You are playing after MLD, it's just another way to change the game choices. I find crawling back from no mana to be entertaining because even I don't pull ahead it's usually not whoever was in the lead before, but it's a lot like a lottery. This is coming from a guy who runs 33 lands in his decks.

The right way to play is to play the game. That's it. You can durdle, you can gimmick, you can swarm, you can destroy things, but they are ALL ways to play the game. If you don't like the way the game is played, don't play the game. I'd say only about 40% of the people I've used MLD against didn't like it and the rest were decent players who rolled with the punches of the game. I've always seen MLD haters as the crazy type of people that would ban something like [[Terrastodon]] just because they didn't like what happened when someone used it affectively.

Nulla di che, non avevo niente da nascondere. Mi ha dato molto pi√π fastidio che sbirciassero nel telefono come dei pazzi, tutte le foto, i messaggi, aprivano app a caso, controllavano tutto a casaccio.

"This. Kids are insurance. For all the trouble they cause, they're worth it when you're 69 years old and have a heart attack. Who's going to call the ambulance, your neighbor? Is the neighbor going to dress you, feed you, organize your medications, talk to the doctor, take you to physical therapy, pick up your rent, get you groceries? Who's going to just talk to you so that you don't go insane? Kids can be an asset, an investment. They might even strike gold and make both of you rich. This moaning about the poor getting in over their heads seems less about a concern for the poor as much as it is a disdain for the poor. I'm still trying to work it out.

I was reading some old posts on /r/medicine the other day and ran across this exchange about daughters. I won't include the user's names because its a pretty old post: 

&gt; I had a patient who, the second I walked into the hospital room, the two daughters at the bedside wrote down my name carefully ‚Äúso we get your name right when we sue you.‚Äù Rather than getting defensive, I sat down and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk. Tell me what‚Äôs bothering you.‚Äù Thirty minutes later, both of them are in tears hugging me, telling me that I‚Äôm the best doctor they ever met, thanking me profusely. The student working with me was awestruck.‚ÄúI did nothing particularly skillful in there,‚Äù I told the student later. ‚ÄúI listened to two daughters who care deeply for their father and desperately want answers. The lesson from this case is...‚Äú Student: ‚ÄúWe should listen to our patients more?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat? No. The lesson is be on your guard whenever you go into a room and see daughters at the bedside. You‚Äôre about to get rocked.‚Äù

...

&gt; My doc frequently states, ‚Äúbad things happen when there are no daughters around.‚Äù

...

&gt; For sure. My nurse thought I was joking, **but every terminal case we have worked, it‚Äôs always daughters running the show**. I have one patient with three daughters, all university professors. He will live forever.

The increased timeline between approving and starting a new housing project increased in the last six years and is behind the real estate bubble.

"Yeah, we've gone over all that.  538 was a slip of the tongue, but it was made clear here:

&gt;Every state gets a free 2 votes, that's because every state gets 2 Senators.  After that, they get a number of votes in accordance with how many representatives they have, which is in turn directly tied to their population and gets adjusted every 10 years with the census.

Gotta read all the words, what I was saying was pretty clear.  Directing the argument to one miscited number (which accounts for only 50 of the 538 electoral votes, FYI) is near strawman.

The *only* issue that's ""unfair"" is the 2 Senate votes, and yet the anti-electoral crowd seems to think the best way to fix it is to roll the 2 votes into the population numbers and increase California's votes by an extra 109, because that makes any sense at all.  Why?  Because the United States is a republic, not a democracy.  There is not one founding document of this nation that calls it a democracy. 

Why is that?  

Well, it's not a democracy because our founding father's were smart enough to realize that a democracy is dangerous to the rights of minorities.  
In a democracy citizens exercise power directly. In a pure democracy, 50% of the group plus one more citizen determine the laws. There are no protections for minority (mathmateical, not racial) rights. Minorities have only those privileges granted by the good graces of the majority.  
If this was a democracy, Cali and NYC would leverage a HUGE advantage in  *every* election, period.  Everybody else in the United States may as well not vote.

‚ÄúDemocracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for dinner.‚Äù - Ben Franklin

""A democracy is nothing more than mob rule, where fifty-one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty-nine.‚Äù - Thomas Jefferson

‚ÄúRemember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.‚Äù - John Adams

I'm sorry that occasionally a handful of states doesn't get to steamroll the entire country, but I'm glad it's the way it is.  We ALL deserve representation and a chance to be heard, not just ""big city Democrats.""  Anyone that asks for the electoral college to be done away with, is asking for the diminishing of minority rights.

Anyone who is actively advocating doing away with the electoral college is only doing so because they are a member of the privledged majority and don't care or understand the impact to the minority.

Hence this isn't a democracy, so I don't even know why we are having this discussion.  Our government protects the states, as it should because let's look at your Montana statement:

Montana is dead last in terms of people per seat, at one per 1 million people and you'd begrudge them 2 bonus seats?  CA has 1 seat per 704,000 people - by the Wyoming/Cali logic, Montana should get a few more seats, but I don't see anybody advocating that.

Regardless, the two votes aren't tied to landmass as was the original statement.

"I've reinstalled it, and run the check. It's now throwing up a yellow ""warning"" triangle next to the USB 3.0+. it didn't show this the first time I ran it.

Following the troubleshooting guide here: [https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4045777/windows-10-get-help-with-pc-compatibility-in-windows-mixed-reality](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4045777/windows-10-get-help-with-pc-compatibility-in-windows-mixed-reality)  
it says this: 'If the list includes an ‚ÄúeXtensible Host Controller‚Äù item that does *not* have ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù at the end of the device name \[...\] you‚Äôll need to uninstall it.'

I did so, and rebooted, but it's just showing the same one again, without ""Microsoft"" at the end. The troubleshooting guide says to do the same thing until it works. If it fails, add a PCIe USB card. I guess I'm gonna try uninstalling that one and rebooting a few more times.

What confuses me is that this was not a problem the first time I ran the compatibility check. The only thing I've done differently is that I tried to update my USB drivers earlier.

I've tried plugging the bluetooth adapter into the PC, no difference. I can't borrow a bluetooth adapter from anyone, though I found a local store that sells them for $35, which is going to be a last resort. Do you know where the list of compatible adapters is? I've looked for it, but I haven't been able to find it. I've tried moving the headset USB cable to a different port, no change. I've unplugged every non-essential USB device.

Since its not necessary to be quick with controls in this game, the only positive I have for using PC is mods (especially on KOTOR 2) but they are playing on PC still. So I don't see what's wrong with them playing on a controller. I mean, except that it's a PlayStation controller and kotor never came out on PlayStation. "

"&gt; Are batch editions of Amiibo rarer than buying the same ones

Batch editions? I guessing you mean like the multipacks, right? If so, then yes because they tend to be underprinted and not restocked as often, if it all.

Apart from toon link, are there any Amiibo's that have been replaced with new poses/styles?

None of characters have been replaced with new poses and styles. It's a bit confusing but multiplies of the same character can appear in different series of amiibo, with different poses and such. But they are considered different amiibo altogether even if you can use them for the same functionality. 

Like there is Smash Bros. Mario, Super Mario Series Mario, Odyssey Mario, 8-Bit, Gold/Sliver Mario etc. for example. They're all Mario and scan all the same in most games. But each one counts to a different series of amiibo. 

&gt; Do you consider the Amiibo cards to be part of a 'collection'?

There's no universal answer to this one as each collectors looks at it differently. Some collector's consider them as much as a part of amiibo like all the figure-based amiibo. Others consider the cards as a different set of collectibles part from the figures but under the amiibo name. 

It's completely up to you to decide if you want to count the cards or not."

"a^(2) \+ b^(2) = c^(2)

, so in square:

a^(2) \+ a^(2) = c^(2)

,that gives you

2a^(2) = c^(2)

,apply your length: 

2a^(2) = 45^(2)

2a^(2) = 2025

divide both sides by 2

a^(2) =2025/2

a^(2) = 1012.5

 Square root both sides to cancel power of 2

a = 31.81980515 this is your side of a square

Dwee sweater: ugh. I am really embrassed to say this, but my head almost doesn't fit through that tiny tiny neck hole. And it was a torture to take it off. It was really warm and fuzzy, but I think not being able to put on/remove easily is problematic for me. Also, this sweater shreds more than my cat...

Barry sweater: I like it! except that it's a size too big(ordered in my regular size S). I will wait for the XS to come back in stock and get it.

\- Tops:

All the tops are very thin, and the v is lower than I'm comfortable with (if you don't add another button you can easily see the bra). All the tops fit my shoulder very weirdly...

The only top that wasn't extremely thin was the black one. I like the material but my boyfriend thinks it looks like old people clothes.

I had gotten together this desert-themed, kinda mixture of Egyptian and Faerun mythologies with a little bit of special Lovecraftian flavor. 

The PCs would be working as mercenaries and disposables for the paladins running the main town, the supposedly last survivors of a cataclysmic event ripped from Warhammer Fantasy - the Webway Gate explosions. Essentially, the PCs would slowly piece together the grand conspiracy deep inside the paladin order to bring about the rule of the Chaos Gods, who are ruled by Tiamat in this world. They would sneak through ancient ruins of a Dragonborn empire, scout out Dwarven enclaves hiding from the rest of the world, and get rare spells and components from deadly trapped castles. All this would lead to a climactic showdown at the gates, which would open to reveal a prosperous solar system that had abandoned the planet for dead - welcome to the Multiverse, boys!

Eventually they would meet Therai the Mad, a warlock of the Great Old One known as the Void Dragon. H would guide them through non-euclidean hellscapes and mind-warping puzzles while slowly feeding them hints about the conspiracy (I had thought at the time that he was in on it, but it was funnier for him just to be messing with the whole thing for a laugh.)

Along the way they would meet a quirky cast of characters such as the raunchy Tabaxi caravan master Dawn of Wealth; the mysterious Dragonborn noble Carvallak, who was flung forward in time when his stasis coffin expired; and the innocent-but-stabby nameless kobold assassin that dogged thier missions at every turn...

Then it just enters you for each drawing. I do a 10 draw subscription with the same numbers every draw. I get an email if I win. So you don't even have to check the numbers, it let's you know and just deposits your winnings into your wallet.

"Yo ElwingNachtzeit, 

Let me tell you what I know.

Yes the effects of having girls notice you is real. I have no idea how to explain that scientifically but just take it that, they can sense that there is something different about you from other man who indulges in fap.

Now let me be honest. While on nofap, your urges around women may not come into a complete control. If not, if might make you even more hornier. What happened to me after 2 months of nofap is that while I do become more interested in REAL PHYSICAL women, I no longer objectify women - they are not just boobs, butts and something for sex. I begin to appreciate them for their personality, their endeavours, their facial features - as human beings rather than curvy sexy sex dolls. Perhaps, this might happen for you - I don't know if you are just on noporn or nofap.

One final note that might seem relevant for you is this. You are suppose to feel thirsty for women. You are a 25 year old grown men with ability to reproduce - it's only natural. What I will tell you is to channel your energy into learning how to pick up women. Read a book called MODELS BY MARK MANSON. It's honestly life changing. Understand that you are suppose to feel thirsty for sex, nothing shameful, it's just being human so rather than controlling your urges, focus your energy on making yourself someone interesting to pick up them grils. 

Read the book. I hope this is helpful. "

But Xi has arguably the largest economy in the world and is officially, rather than just practically, leader for life.  Plus China is masterful as soft power abroad, but hard power at home.

"&gt; You started out saying ""it's entirely an issue about your wallet"" to ""it's about sticking it to Obama/winning""

I'm saying that their stated reasons are entirely financial, not about health.  Their ACTUAL reasons are just sticking it to Obama.

&gt; I mean, that's kinda just the nature of services from the government. Individuals might use them in different amounts, but the usefulness as a whole to society outweighs it. You could make the same argument for police, schools, roads, fire departments in that each person's use of those services is uneven. However they are all seen as pretty necessary to society to the vast majority of people.

Yes, this is the fundamental debate involved, and I'm nothing if not consistent.  I'd love to see as many roads as possible privatized (the highways, really, not the city streets). I see a fundamental difference in police/fire/EMS compared to basic health care, and that's that those things are emergent conditions.  If you were talking about only providing health care in the event of a sudden trauma, then sure, we'd be getting somewhere.  But the fire department doesn't come do periodic check-ups on your house.  They don't provide everyone a free fire extinguisher (maybe some do).  The cops don't install a security system for you.  They're there for emergencies, not routine maintenance.  

&gt; How do you pay for pre existing coverage without an individual mandate or subsidies?

The honest answer is maybe you don't.  Maybe it's time we rethink how we handle these things.  Insurance is exactly that:  It's insurance against something going wrong, so that it doesn't bankrupt you.  It's not supposed to be a scheme where some company takes a huge loss just so you don't have to pay as much for a service that you already know you need.  I know it's easy to view insurance companies as these greed machines, but really, how much sense does it make to say to them ""Hey, you have to pay for this $200,000 treatment, and only collect $200/month in return for it.  If you go under, that's your problem for being so mean.  You have no option to say no to this.""? 

It is no different than if you towed a completely demolished Ferrari up to the front door of State Farm and said ""Hey, I know I don't have any coverage with you, but I'd like to cover this car for its full value.  You can't charge me any more than the guy with the Civic, and also I need you to cover this right now.""  

So how DO we address this?  You need a $200,000 service, and you don't have $200,000.  How would you deal with this in any other case?  "

"Tick populations boom and bust with different seasons (mast) in our oak forests. Mosquitos hatch and move much more easily to mate with the sterile males that get released. Ticks mate in a convenience type interaction, they can‚Äôt fly or jump and find mutual hosts.  Most juvenile ticks are found in mouse or rabbit dens their first year and move from there. 
Survival rate in the Wild varies from low to none which is why thousands of eggs are laid. And disease transmission is upon bloodmeal, not through birth like some mosquito diseases. 
To make dispersal of sterile males into a tick population work you either need to put one on each deer, rabbit and mouse you find and hope it works. Hope opossums don‚Äôt get to them and hope they don‚Äôt fall off or quest elsewhere. This is a lot of work by a lot of people throughout huge areas of PA game lands $$$. 
You get more bang for your buck through culling deer in high tick areas, eliminating gypsy moths (good luck) which the mice feed on besides acorns in masting areas. They also have medicated feed bins for deer that kind of roll frontline onto the back of their necks when they reach into the feed buckets.  This has the problem of either raining off the medication or not enough dosage to each deer for fear of hitting fawns or something someone eats with Uber dosage of meds.

"&gt;Stealing art from MtG and devs destroying the game with new expansions being the main turnoffs for me.

First part was done by the artist not Cygames themselves.

Second part is a major circlejerk in this subreddit, where 90% of people want to just complain and wash away their salt. In fact, in actuality, the last several expansions actually saw great meta changes and relatively great balancing. The majority of the classes see play, and even some ""meme-y"" decks are more than viable and stand their ground.

&gt;the game looks dope

It is.

&gt;I love that it's beginner friendly so I could possibly have it as a side game

I love it so much I have two accounts and it's the only game I play, as in not even other games on consoles/PC.

On the other hand, it's somewhat reasonable for you to think that, since she's largely occupying the space you're renting in the house, that she'd be more of a sub-tenant to you than a full tenant in her own right. I think your friend split the difference and went for a much reduced rate of rent. That's reasonable, though I think you're free to try to negotiate an alternative arrangement if your landlord/friend is amenable.

"Previously throughout the Arrowverse ""The League"" has always been short for The League of Assassins. I don't think she is talking about the Justice League as there would likely be no need to mention that separately of the people who would likely be members.


Oliver's quip to the press last season about Bruce Wayne when being asked if he was the Green Arrow along with the newspaper mentioning a Wayne-Tech merger, and the other newspaper referencing Batwoman leads me to believe that Bruce Wayne may have been exposed as Batman and retired on Earth-1. Otherwise Olivers mention of him make no sense from an in-universe perspective. My guess is that Batwoman takes up the mantle (without Bruce's blessing) because she believed in what he stood for and hears about the other cities heroes on the news."

"Exactly what I was on about before (BisGaming here, now BisVaping). We have focused SO MUCH on the ""safer than tobacco"", ""helps quit smoking"" on products which are NOT cessation products in the first place, we now have the ignorance that actually, nicotine is just an option.

Full stop.), treat it like breathing steam. Can't outlaw clouds! Better regulate that rice maker! Now, it's just an ""option"" to use nicotine. ""Vaping is great. You know, it's, people can say they don't believe in this stuff, but cosider smokers.

And then what? Sleeping forever to run away from our soon to be infinite boredom? (I wasn't taught we would become gods but I don't want to take care of a whole world anyway.)

"Well in order to answer this question, I believe you have to ask yourself first, ""why did I start doing drugs in the first place?"" Everyone is put in different situations, whether it be peer pressure, curiosity, etc. So everyone has different reasons, but what I have learned from my family that doesn't do drugs at all, is that they just have no interest, or are uneducated, or are restricted by religion, or have a bad perception on drugs, etc. i can't even imagine trying to explain shrooms to someone who has never even drank alcohol, it would be something out of this world, and it is, what I'm kinda trying to say is everyone is different, it's not abnormal that people do drugs for &amp; it's not abnormal to never do it in your life, that's just how humans are, do I believe they should at least try it? Yeah fuck it yolo lol "

"I‚Äôm a current Cornell student as well, so I can chime in here. I bring this up all the time and usually get mixed responses, maybe for political correctness, but there is a huge amount of self segregation here. I think Cornell‚Äôs attempts at encouraging diversity and inclusion may have inadvertently caused it - there are different dorms that students who identify with certain groups can choose to live in (one for black students, a Latino living center, one for Native American students), and various programs like the office of diversity initiatives, black student union, society of Hispanic engineers, and a million others. I think these caused students of certain groups to only mingle within those groups because that‚Äôs who they live with and do extracurricular activities with. I pretty much only ever see black students hanging out with other black students. And it‚Äôs certainly not racism or discrimination on the part of other students - Cornell is a very progressive campus."

If you plan on visiting major cities often, especially for leisure, top end Hyatts are amazing.

If you are having a lot of paid travel, a common scheme is to hit globalist (60 nights), the swap to another program (Sparriott or Hilton).

Edit: I also see you mention point values in other comments. Yes you get more points via Hilton, they hand them out like candy. 1 point is not of equal value between Hilton and Hyatt. 25-30k puts you in a Park Hyatt room, 95k in a Conrad (at Max pricing)."

"Agreed, I totally understand leaving one model as a placeholder for now but I'd really enjoy seeing all the different models available and, as you say, exploring the cargo holds.

I think my singe biggest 'major new feature' wish for the game is Procedural Dungeons - it would add depth to so many things in the game that are currently really just flavour.  They don't have to exist ""in"" the main world, they can live in an instance (similar to our Freighter Base) that you access through an airlock or similar door system that hides the loading a little.

There's a lot of benefit from the procedural nature of it too -   as an example, if you had proc-gen Freighter Hold designs, you can have ""flavours"" of those with different moods, textures, hazards, and rewards, generated with rooms similarly to something like the Chalice Dungeons in Bloodborne:  

‚Ä¢ Crashed Freighter (damaged and decayed)  
‚Ä¢ Active NPC Freighter (functional and normal, either from visiting a friendly freighter in a system or boarding and raiding one)  
‚Ä¢ Abandoned Freighter (derelict drifter flavoured like abandoned buildings/stations)

And that's just freighters.  You've got a flavour of Ancient Temple for each race, that you might find the access door to under some ruins.  You could go full-on with different cave systems, maybe found inside large asteroids."

A major renovation like the New 3DS probably won't come out for at least 2 more years, if we ever get one. So if you don't care about those slight changes, you may as well get one now."

"Well up here in central Scotland I found my first 5 of the season on August 19th when the temps were below 19 degrees in the day. Didn't take much rain either. I managed to get a few trips worth by late August and struck gold mid-September. I then had one more bountiful hunt and since then I've not been motivated to go out. Got my fill so I've retired for the season with a good few doses left. I reckon they're still out in full swing where I'm at - I don't hunt actively any more but I always pick 1 or 2 on my way to the shops to see when it becomes too cold for good growth.

I reckon once they're out, they're always out and morning dew is sufficient at keeping them going with long dry spells. Make sure you're always branching out and finding new spots (microclimates and shit)! Branching out helped me tremendously this season. Never thought I'd be able to find huge flushes as early as I did this year.

I used to wait for rains but this season changed my mind. If there's morning dew where you're at, try going out and see if you can find any! Happy hunting, dude!"

"I‚Äôm coping this from a nested comment I made so this ends up in your inbox dear DIL.  

Senior living is very expensive if there is any medical incolvement at all. Assisted living in my area can be 4k a month for a shoebox studio apartment in a bad place. 7k a month for a one bedroom in a good place. And state law limits what we can do health care wise, so for more advanced care you either have to hire a separate company for specific tasks, or pay even more per month and live in a skilled nursing facility(nursing home) the cost for geriatric psych for those who act out dangerously because of their age and limitations is financially crippling, and once any sort of an issue is documented, it will be harder to get placement.
I could very easily see that Doolittle pulled some shit like always, and she and SIL cannot afford an increase in care, or that physically/medically she needs an increase in care, or just the regular cost cannot be afforded and facility is evicting (happens all the time, as does someone moving in and then after their year contract moving out because insurance didn‚Äôt pay as much as the family expected and they cannot afford it, so they go to live with the kids)

Adding in that you absolutely can refuse entry to anyone to your house. There was a MIL who convinced a hospital that she was going to her son‚Äôs place on discharge, and they told the medical van that showed up to not even unload her, and take her back to the hospital. Yes it is a family member, not a transport company, but the result is the same. You do not have to allow her inside, or let her move in at all. "

I will but I won't decide what it'll be until the end of this year. This year I've blown away my goal and will end up reading as much as I did the previous 3 years combined. So I'll need to reevaluate what a sensible goal will be.
"The evidence is that he would probably never be able to beat Blake, Gay, Gatlin, Powell, etc unless he was also doping. The margins in pro athletics are so slim that it's just not realistic to think he wasn't also on gear."
"I also wanted to add something that just occurred to me. Say a person DOES (whoopsie daisy all caps, where are my manners?!) start a relationship under Venus RX and in 4 months it fails and produces heartbreak. But then that negative experiences becomes a catalyst for greater evolution and understanding of self. You would stop that learning experience altogether from trying to stop it from happening at all. That is the Venus RX lesson for some--that things fall apart and we grow through that. To be overly cautious and just not do things is not how we learn. So even then, when the bad thing does occur which you say ""odds are"" it will--you are wrong in your calculus that it still cannot be a rich experience, one that leads to greater good."
I think the question is more because most people don't have memories from that age so it can be confusing why youd have PTSD from a traumatic experience that you don't remember.
"Alright, then, let me spell this out for you: I have no ethical problems with violence against the Trump regime. I think that it‚Äôs sufficiently evil that war would be preferable to its victory. I actually do think that Trump is, in fact, Hitler.

"It sounds like these guys just literally sampled the drums from Justice's 'Phantom pt2'.
 
How Justice created them? I'm not entirely sure, but I remember they said in an interview (from way back) that they've just used the kick and snare from the stems of an old remix they did when working on their album '‚Ä†'. I think that this is what eventually became they're signature drum sound.
 
Based on the sound of it, I think it's a sampled Oberheim DMX kit, with some extremely tight gated reverb on the snare and heavy compression on all the drums together. The kick is most likely layered with a deep tr-808 kick for more bottom end and the snare sounds like it's layered with a clap sometimes. I also think there is a lot of heavy tape saturation on it (probably just by overdriving it on actual analog tape), or it might just be distortion from over-compressing the signal.
 
I hope this helps."

"Meetups are very one-off. You need something where you can be part of a team, or a regular, that builds familiarity while having another purpose that's not specifically social. 

I moved for work away from my SO and we were long distance for 10 months. To be honest, I both relished all the me-time, and loathed the days where I did nothing but work and be home and only talk to a food delivery person. So I: 

- Joined a sport team (kickball, we were terrible, the game wasn't fun but I did see people on a regular basis who were friendly)

- Started going to a yoga studio and a local bar/cafe 2-3 times a week (people who work there and other regulars would see me after a while and chat)

- I volunteered at the food bank (even if it wasn't very social, it feels like a good use of spare time)

I also reached out to anyone I knew who seemed remotely open to hanging out, even if we didn't really have that much in common. There were some weird times, but it was better than staying in and not doing anything and I did make a friend that I keep in touch with now and again.

I would think a good place to start for you is volunteering, also because it'll help you build your resume while you're in school.  It just takes a massive amount of initiative to get started but once you have momentum and start seeing familiar faces it gets easier. "

Another potential reason is to keep the planet under control without expending a large fleet after the enemy has been bested. Ground forces can also take out small cells of enemies with less collateral than an orbital strike, or if say on the planets surface is some sort of defense mechanism(I.e. a huge railgun that can obliterate capital ships) deploying a number of dropships to neutralize the threat would be better than sending a capital ship. Honestly it depends on what the motives and specific conditions of the war and planet.

Speaking of filing method, I am borrowing heavily from [Tiago Forte](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/the-p-a-r-a-method-a-universal-system-for-organizing-digital-information-75a9da8bfb37/) and I have structured my ""system"" this way:  


**!nbox - my inbox**

  
**10\_projects - active projects and support material**

* \[project code\] Project Name

**20\_areas - Areas of Life/Areas of Responsibility -- Roles I have in life that need stuff filed away**

* Health (all my personal health records, diet information, etc.)
* Family (folders for everyone who lives with me)
* House (documents related to the house we bought)

**30\_reference - My personal Wikipedia/data store -- articles, pdfs, audio, whatever**

* js (javascript resources ... I'm a web developer)
* gifs (my pile of reaction gifs)
* wallpaper (my pile of wallpaper images)
* fonts 
* psychology
* cooking
* etc.

**40\_logs - (I break with Tiago here) - different lists and logs**

* reading (reading list, books I've read)
* media (music &amp; movies to check out)
* journal (a collection of daily scratch pad notes I use to organize my day)

**50\_memories - scans &amp; audio with extra meaning - photos &amp; video have their own systems**

This is just a folder with date stamped files. Pictures of my kids artwork. Audio of a speech I gave. Personal memory stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

**90\_shared** \- Since I keep all of this in dropbox, this is just a catchall for when I have a random file I need to share with a link. it goes in here.

**99\_archive** \- old projects, retired Area folders. Stuff that feels like clutter, but for whatever reason I don't want to delete.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

A system like this has some obvious drawbacks (note links are very fragile. not a great looking interface (hello file manager). search is OS dependent. Collaboration is ... iffy) 

For me, however, I'm just enjoying not worrying about the perfect app anymore. I can just use the app that opens/works with that file type.  


And since it's all in Dropbox, I can use that app on my phone (and a good text editor) to access it on the go.

**Article**:

&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese spies often eavesdrop on President Donald Trump when he uses his unsecure cellphone to gossip with old friends, and Beijing uses what it learns to try to sway U.S. policy, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing current and former U.S. officials. 

&gt; Trump‚Äôs aides have repeatedly warned him that his cellphone calls are not secure and that Russian spies routinely eavesdrop on the conversations, but they say the president still refuses to give up his cellular phones, the Times reported. 

&gt; The officials said U.S. spy agencies had learned from people in foreign governments and by intercepting communications from foreign officials that China and Russia were listening to the president‚Äôs calls. 

&gt; The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Times report. 

&gt; China has a sophisticated approach toward the intercepted calls and is seeking to use them to determine what Trump thinks, whom he listens to and how best to sway him, the Times reported, cited the officials. 

&gt; Beijing particularly is trying to use what it learns to prevent the current trade war between the two countries from escalating further, according to the newspaper. 

&gt; Chinese officials rely on Chinese businessmen and others with ties to Beijing to feed arguments and viewpoints to Trump‚Äôs friends in an effort to influence him, the Times reported, citing the U.S. officials. 

&gt; Concerns have been raised on several occasions this year about cellphone surveillance activity in the Washington area. The Department of Homeland Security said in a letter to several senators in March that it had observed activity in Washington consistent with mobile subscriber identity catchers. 

&gt; An FCC commissioner said at a meeting the issue was serious and the surveillance tools could be used by criminals or foreign actors. 

&gt; The Washington Post reported in June that a federal study found signs of sophisticated cellphone spying near the White House and other sensitive locations last year.

"Currently taking roughly 48g a say, spread over three doses, so about 16g per dose. Along with 2g phenibut (used to be more but I'm currently tapering). I'm working with a clinician to taper off of both drugs. She recommended tapering off phenibut first since it will be quicker, and to try not to increase my kratom dose. Haven't really been following that but my dose hasn't really gone up by more than .5 since then. 

I use a little over half a kilo every two weeks, so a kilo per month. My habit (combined with the phen) costs me roughly $200/month. It really sucks, and I can't wait to be done with it. 

Be careful with kratom. If you're not careful or already have a problem with opioids or drugs in general, addiction can really sneak up on you. Personally I can't pinpoint where I went from using it once in awhile to using daily, to being entirely physically dependent on it. 

Be. Careful. "

"Exactly. And if you're completely familiar with your own body, you will feel more comfortable and confident in owning what you like.

A forewarning though, if you've never had sex; some men will *definitely* be offended if you try telling them what you like and how to do it. That, is a *huge* red flag.

"Just one? Ports can easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars (even simple ones) and after Nintendo‚Äôs 30% cut many games at a $5 price would need to sell far more to break even. That‚Äôs not likely for a port of an old game, so it‚Äôs priced at or near  its launch MSRP. 

Many games also have a physical version and there is typically pricing parity. This means that digital and physical cost the same price, even though there is a far smaller profit margin on physical games. 

Another reason is sales. If your game launches at $5 that doesn‚Äôt leave you room to discount. Sure you can discount it to $4, but that only saves the consumer a dollar. For most that won‚Äôt be enough to push them over the edge and they‚Äôll keep waiting for steeper discounts you can‚Äôt afford to give. "

"The issue here is not that AntiFa or radical right wing organizations are sanctioned by the Democrats or the Republicans. What's happening is like what happened in the 1970's - 1990's when the climate of right wing politics got more and more radical, movements sprung up because of that, and eventually you end up with Tim McVeigh blowing up the Murrah Federal Building not because the RNC sanctioned it, far from it, but because the political climate allowed for a crazy supremacist like McVeigh to be emboldened and indoctrinated to terrorism. This is what we risk. The increasing toxicity of the climate will embolden and radicalize partisan aggravators (this is more common on the Right, but it will happen on the Left as well) and we'll end up with incidents like OKC, Columbine and the murder of Alan Berg.

"&gt; Yeah man, my four year old loves ""LEGITIMATE MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH SITES‚Ñ¢"".

Yes, and your four-year-old apparently also has the mental capacity to take legitimate interest and learn about marine life.

&gt; Except for the fact that you're watching an actual real whale with the incredible ability to be trained. That's part of what makes them cool, smart and amazing.

""Incredible ability"" my butt, all it takes is a few behind-the-scenes shock therapy and they're the most obedient puppies you've ever seen.  Anyone who was really interested in marine life would be more interested in the natural interaction between whale and the environment and would condemn training practices.

&gt; Yes. You can be a kid and get excited about cool animals by watching them do tricks in person.

Yes, ""excited by cool animals,"" not ""genuine fascination.""  I watch a guy do cool magic tricks and think that it's fun, that doesn't mean that I'm now hooked on magic.  Find another form of entertainment if all it amounts to is ""it looked cool."""

"I don't know what you do for a living - but take my comment as an explanation of some of the mechanics that writers use in writing fiction, not so much a personal opinion of preference.

Certainly, you're not wrong for having a preference, and people that say your preference is wrong are being dumb.

But I am a professional writer, I get paid to write because I understand certain mechanics, and what you are saying is not JUST an expression of your preference, but rather your personal preference wrapped up in your understanding of the ""proper place"" for various writing tropes, etc.

""the character is broken down in a very real way in a story that wasn‚Äôt hers, just so we know the bad guy is REALLY SPOOKY before he fights another character. That‚Äôs the comic book device I don‚Äôt like.""

I think your focus on this framing of the device is a result of your preference at work.

The truth of how the mechanics work is... more complex.

The character IS broken down in a very real way. In fact, arguably, she's broken in a way that goes BEYOND the villain's intentions, in a way that is deeply personal on a number of fronts.

She is exposed, both emotionally and LITERALLY, her physical vulnerability emblematic of the emotional vulnerability that is IN NO WAY PERSONAL to her tormentor(s). 

It doesn't matter that its her comic or not, because comics are episodic. The story-lines are connected, and as a result of this canonical history that spans multiple artists and writers, this terrible thing happened to this character in all possible worlds (where this incident is actually canon - multi-dimensional and alternate realities notwithstanding). This is not a throwaway moment for the character. She has real issues regarding her relationship with Peter that are CONSTANTLY being referenced in these comics. 

This is about more than just making the villain scary. 

It's about making the hero human, and thus, eminently relate-able. 

It's about reminding us that ALL of these characters should be valued, because they can be taken away, without warning, and without fanfare. 

The same is true for Goliath in Civil War, which, similar to Cap, was more akin to a theme of martyrdom. Goliath was significant because his death blurred the lines of right and wrong to such an extent that someone that was all heart had to ""break the rules"" while someone who is all head had to stand up for them.

That was the reason why Cap's death was so powerful - it was the end of the ""blurring of the lines"". Cap was ALL GOOD. He is the stand-in for virtue that Superman is for DC, just as Tony and the Punisher are emblematic of the ""cruel calculus"" that at times is necessary to save the world from itself (which is one of the reasons why I love Doom so damn much, because he's BOTH of these things in a very flawed human). 

For your own enjoyment, because I honestly believe this will add a new dimension of appreciation for these works... consider that perhaps what feels CHEAP about these examples isn't that it's bad writing. Consider that perhaps what feels cheap is how unfair these experiences are, and that because these characters are supposed to be IDEAL, that making them real, vulnerable, and subject to what is sometimes absurd cruelty is yet another way for you to empathize with these characters. To connect to them. 

To relate to them.

As for the Squirrel Girl thing - here's everything you need to know. Dr. Doom was not always a major bad ass, and would often get put into absurd situations in older comics.

Squirrel Girl commands squirrels.

She defeated Dr. Doom, the dude that was a contender for Sorcerer Supreme, that can out invent Tony Stark, literally conquered Earth and all of reality on more than one occasion, and stole the powers of Galactus, the Silver Surfer... and as far as I know... the only man to ever successfully conquer Wakanda. 

And the girl that commands squirrels defeated Dr. Doom in Central Park.

Now, I'm willing to cut writers a lot of slack... but if that isn't phoning it in, I don't know what is. :p

Seriously, Goliath Black Cat... their ""cheap"" losses ain't got nothing on the defeats the only hope for mankind has had to endure."

"Yes! 

People get caught up in the ""Recycle"" part of the 3 R's (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), without realizing that recycling was never supposed to be the action most emphasized. It's much more impactful from an environmental perspective to first *reduce* your overall consumption; first asking yourself if you even need to have or consume this thing (Do I need another brand new red lipstick or black leggings? Probably not. I probably already have something the fills my needs.). 

Then if you do need to consume or use or buy something, try to do so by *reusing* something you already have (creating rags out of old t-shirts instead of buying sponges from the store), or that already exists (buying clothing secondhand). 

Then, if you truly need to buy a brand new thing that you didn't already have and couldn't find secondhand, at least try to *recycle* whatever results from your consumption.

You're right. Recycling is not the answer. Or at least it's not the whole answer. Reducing and reusing should come first."

"Other orgs don't need to expand like this because they were already ahead of the curve. By no means am I hating on Hecz when I say this, but in terms of expansion, OpTic was behind most of the other big teams prior to Infinite taking over. In the past year or so OpTic has picked up a league team, an overwatch team, a dota team, a pubg team, a fortnite team, a new gears team, and another new csgo team. On top of that they have added multiple content creators. I'm not saying this is necessarily a good thing, but in terms of growth and expansion, they are just catching up. 


And I'm guessing most of the reason Hecz never did this stuff is because of funding and lack of manpower. 

Like I said, growth for the sake of growth isn't what OpTic was built on and thats why so many fans are against it, but I'm sure it would be hard to sit back and watch other teams make moves to better themselves without trying to do something to catch up. "

"So if A is not square, then AA\^T A\^T A will not be invertible? 

Oh, of course- if A is m x n then the rank of A cannot be more than min(m, n).

That brings up another question, which gets into Markov chains (tangentially).  It turns out that P = AA\^T is a stochastic matrix, and what I want to compute is the sum of P\^k from k = 0 to infinity, which is (I - P)\^-1 assuming that inverse exists. If (I - P) is singular, does that imply that the power series diverges?  I think so- if that series converged 

&amp;#x200B;

M = I + P + P\^2 + ...

M(I - P) = I - P + P - P\^2 + P\^3 - P\^3 ... = I

&amp;#x200B;

Which means that (I - P) is the inverse of M and that M = (I - P)\^-1 which is a contradiction.

"&gt; &gt;     If armour had been worn, many of the fatal wounds to the torso and head would have been prevented
&gt; 
&gt; The real factor in this is shields. Shields prevented the overwhelming majority of wounds. People don't realize armor was the ""oh crap I screwed up and exposed myself"" failsafe.

Bill (1892) comments on the large number of arrow wounds to the arms, with many being due to the soldiers attempting to protect themselves with their arm from the incoming arrow. Shields would have been very useful in those moments.

Archers do have a slight problem with shields, since the bow is a two-handed weapon. Thus pavises, shield-bearers, shooting from behind the shield-wall. Also specialised archers' armours like these Siberian (Koryak) armours from 1901:

"he was fired.......likely for many many reasons. My theory is that the police report Pole had Karine file against the man who supposedly leaked the nude pictures of her was found to be bullshit. Pole leaked the pictures himself after accusing Karine of being unfaithful during the tell all and wanting a DNA test after their baby is born . If the man in the pictures is innocent of leaking said pictures, its about to blow up in Poles face and he could be charged with slander.....TLC will want to distance themselves from the shit storm. With Pole, each new thing is creepier than the last. I honestly hope that Karine and her family will realize that enough is enough with this psycho. She needs to stay in Brazil with her family and raise her baby......if she is set on a life in the US one day, keep looking, because DAMN.....anyone would be better and safer than Pole."

"While true under mathematical definitions, when people say vector, they nearly always mean a (1,0) tensor and use tensor for the more general object. I mean, it may be mathematically correct to call a scalar a vector because you can add them and scale them by a constant, but no one actually calls them that.

I was specifically talking about how the energy momentum tensor can often be thought of as the outer product of the momentum 4 vector and a sort of density 4 vector."

"I work in dry cleaning.  We are relatively close to a town full of old money and there is not a whole lot of competition around us.  We offer a service to dry clean/wash and press bedsheets and comforters and we charge crazy amounts... Like close to $20 a sheet, $6 a pillow case and, depending on the size up to $60 for a comforter.  Unbelievably we are flooded with bedding right now.  

To me, the idea of pressing a bedsheet seems ridiculous to begin with (you get maybe one night where it isn't wrinkled?)

But anyway, I've come to the conclusion that once you're so rich you basically are just looking for ways to spend money.   Only way I can explain it.

I told my friend I was thinking about buying a second hand pair of leather boots and she flipped out calling me a disgusting murderer despite me being vegan and her being omni. She decided meat for nourishment wasn't unethical but killing animals for fashion was completely repulsive.

It made me realize she's been heading towards crazy for awhile and I just hadn't seen it.

That said, I can totally see sexist motivations in her teacher doing this. We have a doctor shortage, which is set to get much worse, as the result of 50% of women either leaving the profession or switching to part-time within ten years. Women are about 50% of med students. That's a &gt;25% attrition rate. That's a massive fucking problem if you genuinely care about medicine. Or, about the $500,000 in tax payer money each individual's medical education is partially funded by.

**Article**:

&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic leaders in Congress said on Wednesday that President Donald Trump‚Äôs call for unity after suspicious packages were sent to leading Democratic figures ‚Äúring hollow‚Äù because of his past statements that condone acts of violence. 

&gt; ‚ÄúTime and time again, the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions,‚Äù Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives top Democrat Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. 

&gt; They cited the Republican president‚Äôs ‚Äúsupport for the congressman who body-slammed a reporter, the neo-Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville, his supporters at rallies who get violent with protesters, dictators around the world who murder their own citizens, and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people.‚Äù

Honestly, I think that you're projecting your own values onto him. 

&gt;He skipped his high school prom. He doesn't drink and he doesn't smoke.

So what? This is all true of me as well, and I'm not saying ""no to life"" or whatever. It sounds like you don't know enough about him to know why he makes such decisions for himself, so it's kind of shitty for you to call him a no-lifer for this. The two of you probably have radically different ideas of how to enjoy life, and it seriously seems like you're judging his actions with your values. Unless he's hurting you or himself, stop the judgement.

In that trend, maybe rather than telling him something, why don't you ask him instead? Ask him about how he spends his time, if he's maybe asexual, if he's waiting for the right person, and if so, if he maybe thinks that the right person is \*gasp\* *you*. Maybe you're right and all he secretly wants is to get laid, but it sounds like you haven't even considered the possibility of the opposite: that he's perfectly happy with his virginal, introverted, healthy life, has plenty of hobbies/fun work to fill his time, and doesn't want sex or a relationship.

"Bottled water. 

Now, I'm not saying it isn't worth it to buy water when you're thirsty. A lot of the time it IS absolutely worth a few bucks to make sure you're staying hydrated and every now and then I do this too. What gets me is that more people dont make a regular habit of bringing a water bottle with them when they go out to do just about anything. I always bring mine with me places and it's really not much of a nuisance to just hold it when you're shopping since you can rest it down just about anywhere and nobody will take it because people don't really steal cheap used water bottles or even really want to touch them in the first place. 

If you have a backpack, strap-bag, or purse, it's even easier since you can usually slip it in somewhere it stays upright and is still accessible. Same goes for bike riders: slide it into that little rack between your legs and there's virtually no chance someone is gonna get thirsty enough to see a water bottle on a bike and think it'd be a great idea to smack their own lips down on the same orifice as a random stranger.

If and when I lose it, I never feel bad because it's just a $2 Gatorade bottle and I'm not at all attached to it and after several months it's usually about time to buy a new one anyway. Tons of people just throw away their bottles after using them once so if someone in your house does this you've pretty much got an unlimited free supply as long as they're willing to set them aside for you to wash/disinfect and reuse.

"&gt; That said, there were also areas where the limitations of the hardware held it back.

"It is sad. It'll be interesting to see what changes the new government makes. I like Mahathir because he has a reputation for not having much tolerance for religious zealots. That said, his appointment of the education minister was controversial because the minister was previously a member of PAS, the Islamist party. Most people mock him because his policy changes have thus far been fairly meaningless (e.g. changing the color of school shoes from white to black), trying to implement mandatory swimming lessons, etc.), but as a parent, I think those are the day-to-day policies that the old government had simply been ignoring. But at least he hasn't introduced any demands for more Islamic education in our schools. Also, we should keep in mind that the Mahathir government never really expected to win the general election. Their only goal was the give the old government a run for its money. So they never really set out with any predetermined policies for what they would do if they won (which is pretty funny when you think about it)."

"To a certain point, it's not good to obsess over implementations - aka \*how\* a class do something. What matters is \*what\* a class can do. Interfaces help to reassert that point.

Another advantage of interfaces is helping to avoid the diamond problem when dealing with multiple inheritance in C language.

&gt;But I dont really understand how an interface provides this, because it  is still connected to methods defined in the specific classes.

Not always. In an education project maybe. But in a professionnal project maybe you are mocking stuff for your unit test; maybe that interface is just an api for a a soap or rest client; maybe your concrete classes are just a bunch of  proxyfied code. Those ""specific classes"" may really well just a figment of your imagination, and more often than you think. The **point** is it's important to separate (decouple) your interface contract from your implementation. Think of it as an exercice."

Yep. That and the end of the Fed's zero interest rate ""funny money"" lending to bankers, so they could turn around and buy Treasury Bonds to make free money off government interest payments.

I don't know how on earth this is still upvoted, but that's not what happened.

In financial markets, there is a gap to be earned between short term money and long term money. That's how banks make their money. They borrow short term and lend long term.


Under normal conditions, the Federal reserve affects rates by buying/selling short term bonds and tri party repos in the open market.

During/after the financial crisis, they did just that, to push rates as low as possible. But because the fed didn't consider this enough, they started buying up long term bonds as well (QE).

Why is that relevant to your statement? Because by lowering the rates on longer bonds, and making sure the gap between short yield and long yields tightens, the fed made it **less profitable** to buy long term treasuries with short term money. Historically unprofitable, in fact. The Fed did this intentionally, to push banks towards lending

Just because you could borrow short term at 0% doesn't mean that it was a particularly profitable trade.  The gap (steepness of the yield curve) is what matters. It *seems* like free money, but it isn't. First of all, there is risk involved, because you have to roll over the short debt, perhaps at a higher rate in the future (again, the risk/reward was historically bad here). Second, banks have a limited amount of money they can borrow against their equity capital, they can't just borrow as much as they want. If they had bought long term treasuries (again, at a historically bad time) instead of lending money, they would have had abysmal returns. "

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

(This is going to be a very long post)

Background:

I  am in my first year living on campus at a state university, and this is  the first time that I have lived with non family members. I previously  attended a community college and drove from home to school and then  back. My living space is a suite; it‚Äôs a long hallway with three  separate rooms, which should have two people each in them, and a kitchen  at the end of the hall.

As  I said, each of our rooms should have two people staying in them, but  my roommate upgraded to a nicer dorm at the start of the semester, so I  have been lucky enough to have my own room. Another one of my  suite-mates has probably only been to his room three or four times  during the year. This leaves one of my suite-mates, John, with his own  room. The only room with two people in it has two exchange students from  the Netherlands. So four of us share what should be a six person space.  Both of them will only be here for half the year. Lets call them Bob  and Jack.

When  I moved in, Bob was the first person I met. He seemed nice enough, but I  immediately noticed  he was extremely talkative and quite loud. Nothing  wrong with that, I thought. I met Jack shortly after. He is a really  great guy and a good friend. The two of them had already met each other,  along with some other Dutch students, as part of their exchange  program. Before school started we had a week to settle in, and the four  of us hung out a lot. We also hung out with some of the other Dutch  exchange students. During this first week I learned that one of the  Dutch exchange girls had pretty bad anxiety problems, so Jack helped her  whenever she wasn't feeling well. Lets say her name is Jill.

The  first couple of weeks of the school year passed without incident. About  a month into the semester, some of the Dutch kids took a weekend trip  to Chicago. They shared a couple of rooms together, and after going out  for the day they would come back and have some drinks. After the second  night, Jill started feeling like she was about to have a panic attack.  While Jack tried to help her calm down, Bob started pressing her on why  she had anxiety. She said that she had always had issues with it, but  when she was back home she was able to control it better because she had  a group of friends to talk to about it. Bob continued pressing her,  asking if she had a boy who she talked to about her problems when she  was home. She said yes she did, and at this point apparently Bob went  off into another room and left her alone. This interaction made Jack  somewhat upset, thinking that Bob's questioning was rude, but he didn't  say anything to him directly.

As  Jack tried to help her calm down, Bob got onto Google and looked up  articles about how anxiety ""isn't real"" and sent them to Jill. He also  texted her about how everything she was going through was ""just in her  head/she can get over it"". He also apparently sent a sort of  ""screenplay"" that he made about Jill and the guy she would talk to back  home. In this he talked about how this guy was just making Jill feel  ""fake anxiety"" so that he could talk to her.

Needless  to say, the whole group was pretty livid. The Dutch kids did their best  to stay away for him for a week or so. During this time, Bob came to me  to talk about it. He gave his version of the story. Eventually I  figured out that the story he told me was filled with half truths, as I  later heard the actual account of what happened from Jack and Jill. Even  without getting the actual story, I was straight up with Bob and told  him that I thought it was really messed up what he did, and that he  should apologize. This was the first time that I thought something could  be up with Bob.

After  a few weeks, Bob had somewhat apologized and the Dutch kids started to  let him hang out with him again. Jack said that they started feeling  badly for him because he had been part of their exchange program, but he  admitted they still were quite unhappy with him.

About  a week later, Jack, Bob, and I where hanging out with two girls from  our building. We were just talking for a bit, and everything was going  well. At one point Bob changed the subject, asking the girls the girls  who they liked. I assumed he was just trying to be flirty, but he  started acting really strangely when they said there wasn't anybody they  could think of. He started talking about how ""young girls like you two  should always have a crush"". They kinda laughed to each other and then  he said ""Why are you two laughing? I know there is only three reasons  two young, supple, girls like you would be laughing; you're laughing  about drugs, boys, or sex."" He continued, saying ""It's got to be one of  those three things! Tell me what it is!"". We all became pretty  uncomfortable, and Jack and I tried to change the subject. He continued  to try and push the girls, and eventually we all decided to head back to  our rooms. I would put some other things that he said here, but I don't  want to write down anything unless I can 100% remember what he said. I  just found this interaction extremely creepy.

When  I initially moved in I had longish hair, which I had dyed over the  summer. It was supposed to come out differently then it had, (eventually  it settled into being blonde) so I went and got it cut off. Because I  had it dyed to the roots I had to cut my hair very short.

Fast  forward another week from us talking to the two girls. When I arrived  back at our suite, there was some light-hearted jabs from Jack and Mike,  and they talked about how I looked different. Most of their jokes were  pretty good! We were sitting around just bantering, and then Bob came  in. He had a couple of good jokes as well, then at one point he said I  ""looked like a crackhead"". I thought okay that was a good roast,  laughed, and forgot about it. (I literally just had short hair and a  beard. I don‚Äôt look/act/dress like someone who smokes crack. While I  might not be appearing on a GQ cover any time soon, I don't think I'm  that unattractive of a guy. I am pretty secure with how I look. This is  important later on.)

Next  day I'm walking back to my room from class, and I see Bob walking my  way. I say hello, and he says ""Oh what's up Cracky, smoke any crack  lately?"" I just laughed it off, but I couldn't help but feel that he was  trying to make it personal for some reason. A few days later he kept  saying essentially the same thing. At this point I told him to stop,  because the joke wasn't really funny anymore. Once again I felt that he  was going beyond just banter and trying to make it personal.

That  weekend Bob, Jack, Jill, another Dutch kid, and I went out and had  drinks. Eventually we ended up back at Jill‚Äôs apartment, were we decided  that we would hang out for a bit. When we got there we sat down on some  couches and someone suggested playing music. At this point Bob asked to  play a song. Once he picked a song, he sat on the same couch as me. He  was being rather loud, but I was aware that he had been drinking, so I  wasn't going to kill his fun. I was seated at one end of the couch, and  throughout the song he kept scooting closer to me. At one point he  started waving his hands in my face and yelling the lyrics in my face.  Then he started calling me ""Cracky"" again, along with making remarks  about how I was ugly or whatever else. I pushed him away and just kind  of ignored him (I didn't want to start a fight). He continued doing this  and started calling Jack a ""suck-up"" when he suggested that Bob just  sit on the other side of the couch. Eventually the other Dutch Kid and I  left back to our rooms.

(I feel that this next part is important to get a perspective on Bob‚Äôs personality and how he treats people.)

Since  the beginning of the year, Bob has been leaving messes everywhere. He  will leave kitchenware and food just strewn about the kitchen. He hardly  washes anything and doesn't ever throw any of his trash away. He will  leave messes for so long that the food on the plates/bowls essentially  calcifies. My roommates and I started the year by taking turns cleaning  the kitchen, even though Bob was the one mostly making the messes. We  agreed when we first met it would be unfair to have one person do all  the cleaning in our suite. Eventually we stopped eating at the house  completely because we would end up washing 1-2 of our dishes and 10+ of  Bobs. This is in addition to cleaning up his trash. One day I washed  Bob‚Äôs dishes for probably 30 minutes and then politely asked him to just  try to run water in the bowls when he was done with them. He said he  would, and I thought that was that. Later that night I walked out to get  water and saw 3 or 4 bowls caked with food sitting on the table.  Oftentimes Bob will take Jacks food (eggs, yogurt, etc.) and will eat  well over half of it without asking. Bob also will essentially flood the  bathroom when showering, and doesn't flush the toilet, even after  shitting. Recently he has been knocking on the door as soon as I step  into the restroom (we all share one bathroom) and telling me to hurry  up. This has happened multiple times just this week. When we asked Bob  to stop doing these things he said that he would try, but it was hard  for him because he has ADHD.

Two  weeks ago the Dutch kids went on another trip, but Bob wasn't invited. I  stayed with my friends elsewhere on campus that weekend. John stayed in  our suite and informed Jack and I that Bob had moved their beds  together because he thought he was going to have a girl over. This was  after Bob explicitly told Jack not to touch his bed when he was gone.  Jack also has found his stuff moved around recently and he thinks that  Bob might be going through his stuff.

"Here is how charcoal works, you input heat energy to  start the charcoal, charcoal burns on it's own until its ashed over white, charcoal gets used up turns to ash.

You are starting at the second step with too much fuel.   I  would rather limit the amount of fuel burning rather than limiting the airflow.  Closing the vents ain't gonna stop that inferno you have started.

  I bet it would only take 5 coals for to get your grill to max out at 225 and then fade back.   So there is a thing called the snake or minion method where only a few coals are actually hot, over time these coals use up their fuel to heat the grill and to start the next round of coals and so on. 

 Instead of using the basket, you line the bottom of you grill in charcoal so it burns like a snake head to the tale.  You can use the basket, but just have to use much less fuel.   The trick is to maintain the balance of old coal to the starting of new coal.   

The most frustrating thing to me was the amount of energy it takes to get new coals to kick off if I didn't get have enough contact with the burning ones.   My trick is to always have a supply of coals in the chimney starter already ashed over to throw in if the temperature gets too low, but just a few to get the temperature back up. "

They have a kind of publishing branch that through that they get ownership rights to series that they then make anime from. I don't remember the full details but that is how they got Evergarden. It actually won in some author contest they hold but being in it and winning gives them the rights to it as a requirement letting them make it into a anime if they so choose. MAid dragon wasn't a part of  any that and was purely a 3rd party property that they made because  the higher up liked it personally. Most of what they make now is what you'd call in house more or less.

"Part of it is the suits they wear. They have specially designed gear that helps their body support the weight. They also wear belts to keep their insides. . . well inside. The other thing is the adaptive nature of the body. These guys have been training with weights for a decade or more in most cases. So, the body slowly adapts to the stress and builds denser bone as well as muscle. 

The top guys were usually athletes before they started training for this. Eddie Hall was a swimming champion as a teenager. Brian Shaw played basketball in highschool. Dave Tate and Jim Wendler played football. The list goes on and on. The point is, even before they trained for power lifting or strong man they took them to to adapt their bodies to the physical demands of high effort training and performance. They built a foundation. "

**Article**:

&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that threats of political violence have no place in the United States, promising a full investigation into suspicious packages that were mailed to prominent Democrats and others. 

&gt; ‚ÄúThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice. We will spare no resources or expense in this effort,‚Äù Trump, a Republican, said at an event on opioid abuse. 

&gt; ‚ÄúIn these times, we have to unify, we have to come together, and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.‚Äù 

&gt; On Wednesday, the Secret Service said it had intercepted suspicious packages sent to former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Packages were also reported to have been mailed to CNN, billionaire George Soros, and other frequent, public targets of Trump‚Äôs scorn.

"Maybe I'm too cynical now, but I can't take it was a genuine effort by the company trying to care about their employees.  Often, it's a very cynical and an ""oh we're so clever and sneaky to do this"" attempt by the company to screw workers out of more productivity.  The standard on-site perks (coffee, food, gym, etc) are a perfect example of this.  They're all designed to encourage you to stay at work longer.

As for weeding out the good from the bad, I've found this hard because firstly, I'm almost always being interviewed by a manager, someone who will not be having the same experience of said culture as me.  And secondly, the amount of them that lie in interviews is just...mindblowing.  So often I've had a lot of cross my fingers and pray moments when I accept a role."

"Don't. I work in college admissions, and this isn't unusual, and we (and your future advisor) plan for it. I'm not usually directly involved with advising students, but I handle a lot of data, and 'Undeclared' is common, and encouraged if a student is unsure.

With any college I've worked at or attended, there's a block of required classes that aren't major-specific that you'll have to complete anyways. Get started, and take your time. While the classes are general, the professors involved often are *not*, and their specialties aren't hidden knowledge.

Ask after class. Shoot them an e-mail with questions. Get an idea if the thing they've quite literally dedicated their careers to is something you'd want to do too. 

Additionally, there's other options -- taking cheaper gen-ed classes at a community college (if it's local to a 4-year college you're interested in, they're often able to give you a 1:1 class credit comparison for later transfer), or looking at non-college education in trades, if you find something specific you think you'd enjoy.

"Lets say that both tables start in A1.

This should go in Sheet2 B2:

VLOOKUP($A2, Sheet1!$A$1:$C$5000, 2, 0)

This should go in Sheet2 C2:

VLOOKUP($A2, Sheet1!$A$1:$C$5000, 3, 0)

The logic is pretty simple, the first input of the formula is the search key, basically what you are searching for in the other table, the second argument is the table in which you are search for the first argument, in your case I ""selected"" the data, it's better to use the whole column, just in case your table grows bigger. The third argument is the number of the column in which the result is. So if you look at the sheet1 table, you are searching for John Kerry ($A2) in the sheet1 table ($A$1:$C$5000) and want the result from the second column for ID (2) and third column for step (3). Last argument is a true (1) or false (0) argument, when you want exact matches you go for false, when you want aproximated matches (works only with interval of numbers) you go fot true.

There is better ways of doing the number of the column argument such as using MATCH function and better formulas than VLOOKUP [As INDEX(MATCH())], so I would take a look on these if I were you.

Lastly, take in account that VLOOKUP has some restrictions, 1) you are always searching for the search key in the first column of the table and, 2) If there is more than one result for your ""search"" the formula will always return the first result

"The Dragon sword that you have works best with its Complete set - You need the full set 7P bonus to get the max out of it.

So basically you can try 6P Dragon Ninja set + 3P Izanagi Grace.

So dragon Sword + 5 Piece dragon ninja Armor pieces.

Secondary Sword+Primary and secondary Ranged = Izanagi or Amaterasu grace.

If you have the smithing text for the dragon sword, I'd recommend you to forge the sword until you get one with a star skill - Either Flowing Shadow or lai Quickdraw.

I recommend you to use Flowing Shadow cause it's one of the best sword skill there is. Also Equip the sword mystic art to increase back attack damage from the sword tree.

On the Sword at maximum familiarity, you need Change to Attack A+ (of your highest skill - Heart and Skill in ur current case), Familiarity Damage A+(You can only get A+ on etherial weapons upon rolling the stats with 3 divines), Pierce Guard 13.9 or 14, Final Blow 24.9% (4 usable slots apart from Set, star and locked stat).


You can use any non set secondary Weapon, primary and secondary ranged weapon of your choice. You can go with Amaterasu Grace if you need additional life else Izanagi for increased damage. Amaterasu can be farmed from Marabashi mission - Keep doing it until you have all the pieces. Izanagi grace is abyss only (You have to enter Abyss floor 34, defile a bunch of items, kill the bosses in floor 34,35,36 and exit the floor after killing the 37th floor boss - You may need to save scum for better results).

For the ranged weapon, get Agility Bonus A+ and No guard break (aiming)

Given that Dragon set gives you unlimited Shuriken's, you can inhert Thrown weapon Damage and thrown weapon X2 damage on all the armour pieces and charms with thrown weapon Damage.

But I personally prefer Ranged firearm reduction. You can get upto 75% reduction which is a huge deal for this build as it's a glass canon build.

Get Amrita absorption (increase damage) on helmet (increase life - If you use Izanagi grace), surrounded (increase damage) and status ailments (increase damage) on the other Armor pieces.

Tweak around to your liking and see what works out. Reply if you have any questions.

**Article**:

&gt; SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell intensified his outreach to U.S. lawmakers over the summer, a review of his public calendar shows, even as President Donald Trump stepped up his attacks on the Fed and on Powell himself. 

&gt; Powell had at least 33 individual meetings with members of Congress in June, July and August, surpassing the 27 meetings he took in his first four months on the job, monthly calendars posted to the Fed‚Äôs website show. All told, he had more than triple the number of meetings with lawmakers in his first seven months compared with his predecessor Janet Yellen. 

&gt; Most of Powell‚Äôs meetings in recent months took place in person on Capitol Hill. Over two particularly intense mid-August days, he met with seven members of the Senate Banking Committee, charged along with the House Financial Services Committee with overseeing the central bank. 

&gt; Powell met with slightly more Republicans than Democrats, reflecting the overall makeup of Congress 

&gt; The calendar does not say what was discussed, nor who initiated the meetings, and a Fed spokesman declined to comment. But Powell told Marketplace radio in June he sees ‚Äúwalking those halls‚Äù in Congress to meet with lawmakers an important part of his job. 

&gt; All the more so as Trump lobs increasingly pointed criticism at the Fed and its interest rate increases, which began under Yellen and have continued under Powell, her Trump-appointed successor. 

&gt; Trump made his first public comments signaling dismay about his pick on July 19, when he told CNBC he was ‚Äúnot thrilled‚Äù about the Fed‚Äôs rate increases. In August, in an interview with Reuters, he demanded the Fed help out on the economy.. 

&gt; This month he has called the Fed ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and a threat to economic growth. On Tuesday he told the Wall Street Journal he ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù regrets appointing Powell. 

&gt; Orrin Hatch, Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, on Wednesday defended Powell, telling Bloomberg News, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with everything they do but they are still pretty good people.‚Äù Hatch is among the members of Congress with whom Powell has met. 

&gt; Meanwhile, Powell and his colleagues have continued to raise interest rates, and rarely does a week goes by without several Fed policymakers giving public remarks about why rate hikes are necessary in the face of an economy with unemployment at a 49-year low and inflation near the Fed‚Äôs 2-percent goal. 

&gt; Congress mandates the Fed to pursue full employment and stable prices. 

&gt; Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester repeated on Wednesday that Trump‚Äôs public criticism does not affect policy decisions. 

&gt; Fed policymakers acknowledge that increasing interest rates even just a few more times will likely slow the economy and increase unemployment, but that, they say, is a reasonable price to pay for keeping inflation contained. 

&gt; ‚ÄúEveryone should be allowed to criticize us and question whether or not we are undertaking the right actions,‚Äù Chicago Federal Reserve bank President Charles Evans said earlier this month. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs where the chairman of the Fed and the rest of us go out in public and talk about just why we undertook these actions, and hopefully people understand that.‚Äù

"Did I? Time is money. A 7700k overclocked to 5GHz would take about twice as long to render out a 3D project in Cinema 4D. So a render that takes 8-12 hours with my shiny desk weight would take 16-24 hours with a 7700k. And there goes my ability to work in the day and render while I sleep. And there goes a day lost to rendering that I could've been getting another day of a job done. In other words, there goes one day of pay. Now let's say I make a the same as a Burger King employee, say $12 an hour. Now let's say that I lose two days of work each week because I'm running a 7700k. Losing $96 a day, twice a week, for a year adds up to $9216. Now let's say that 3D modeling pays a little better than working at Burger King... Do you see where I'm going with this?

I started the thread to say I found a way to leverage the 2080 Ti in Rust, not for a pissing contest. I get your comment was meant as an insult for wasting my money like an idiot. I'd be running an overclocked 8086k if my computer were a gaming PC or gamed enough to justify building a dedicated gaming PC. My PC does just fine for gaming though. I'm finally getting 60fps on Ultra in GTA V which my old 1080 Ti could never come close to so I'm a happy camper.

I screamed really loud (sorry upstairs neighbors) and started to brush my head really hard to get the moth off. Well, I must have done it harder than I thought because then I caught a movement and the moth dropped...INTO MY LAP!!  I jumped out of my chair and screamed again (again, sorry neighbors). About a second later, I realized that I was being over dramatic and got really embarrassed even though I was home alone.

"It took me a while to get into at first as well, but now it's probably (almost definitely) my favorite album of all time. Not sure if this will help, but I'll link some cool stuff to check out for each track that really made me fall in love with the album.

First of all, listen to the [Pioneer Works](https://youtu.be/YJNi7aRwUzU) versions of the songs. Seems like this album is really meant to be listened to live, and this is hands down the best recording. I probably listen to it in one form or another every week. It's better than the album (to me).

- 22 (OVER SooN) - [Rock the Garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ5X8OelEgs) - A pretty straight up version, but most of them are. I just love the atmosphere for this performance.
- 10 d E A T h b R E a s T - I fucking HATED this song when I first heard it. I felt like it didn't make any sense on the album.
  - [Stevie Nicks - Wild Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPEhIoKeTg0) - This is the song that's samled in 10. I had a small Fleetwood Mac kick after this album came out and absolutely fell in love with this little song. Only this live version is any good because unfortunately the studio version is way different.
  - [Pioneer Works Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJNi7aRwUzU&amp;t=690s) - The drums in this version sound a lot more natural. I love watching Matt McCaughan go absollutely apeshit on the kit.
 - Also, try listening to this shit on the freeway and drumming along. It's a blast.
- 715 CREEKS - This one also took me a long time to get into.
 - [This live version](https://youtu.be/OOGnPsSikEQ?t=65) really helped me feel the emotion of the song and the backing ""vocals"" sound like a goddamn church organ which is really cool.
- 33 ""GOD"" - I liked this song pretty early, but have a couple more live versions you should check out.
 - [Cork Opera House](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19n_kwJ-2ZmNE-fRwbvStQ8YZtXcQDZho) - Pretty much universally loved on this sub. You can find the audio using that link. Justin left a lot of samples at home for this set and I think it's super cool. Also, it starts with the more disorienting sounds at the begging that pan back and forth, so listen with headphones because it's a really neat sound.
- 29 #Strafford APTS - Probably the most ""normal"" song on the album. 
 - Wanted to share the [Hollywood Bowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGCHlE00oeM) version just because I think the beginning is funny. 
 - [This version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTK4NB-JAuk) is also pretty cool because you can see Sean Carey manipulate Justin's vocals live. (small keyboard on top of the piano)
- 666 - Yessss. Gotta listen to the [Eaux Claires 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA7F4zioJcQ) version. It was the first time they ever played it and it has a little extra punch that you don't normally get anymore.
- 21 M00N WATER - Not really anything for you here unfortunately...
- 8 (circle) probably my favorite song of all time. I loved this fucked as soon as I heard the bootleg version of the album with all the Facebook messenger boops.
 - If you do drugs at all, my recommendation is to get super high and just watch the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPsBFPX_yU4). It's awesome. I don't know why, it just is.
 - If you don't! [This version](https://youtu.be/_f2-88pyRtU?t=49) is also VERY cool. Not something I listen to all the time, but definitely a cool change of pace.
- ______45______ - [Rock the Garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfaVHfKxlYA). Performance is wonderful. Also, the editing here is super cool.
- 00000 Million - Honestly, I still haven't found a live version I like more than the [studio version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FqojM1TYqo). It's so beautiful."

"Don't think AMD 15P is going to be realistic, it's already down 43% this month. I'm pretty big on PC building, and these are my opinions that I'll say below.

&amp;#x200B;

I first started building in 2016, when AMD only had the FX-4350 ($150-200) and A10-5800k, which were on 32nm dies while Intel had the i5-3570k ($210) at a comparable price, which was a 22nm die, with AMD at a stock price of \~$7. AMD has made huge strides in the processor department, making the RYZEN chips comparable to Intel processors compared to the large single threaded performance gap of two years ago. It doesn't seem like this now, but my point is that AMD has made a huge improvement in their share of the desktop and laptop market. In the graphics department, they've stayed a step behind or on par with NVIDIA. While I feel that it was overpriced at the \~$40 mark, they definitely have growth potential to stay pretty on top of things.

&amp;#x200B;

My whole reasoning behind buying the NVIDIA ""dip"" was because there was no big news happening around them and they were already down 4% for the day so I assumed they'd make a small rally by EOD like with previous days, which I was very wrong on. So there was some reasoning behind it but I'm pretty much an idiot"

What other skills do you have, or can you hire out? These days, it's not that hard to set up a side hustle to bring in some extra money, especially if you are online-savvy. Look around, see what you can do. Even a little dropshipping store reselling stuff from AliExpress can bring in some much needed dough quickly - at this time of year, if you pick a trending item and run some ads to bring in traffic, you may find that's all you need, because people are eager to buy!

&amp;#x200B;

There are lots of other ways to make money online, only you can decide if that is the way to go. Alternatively, maybe start using your sales skills to sell other stuff ... do either of you have any hobbies that can double as a side hustle?

For pretty much anything, you'll need time. Is your flooring biz job a typical 9-to-5 that doesn't allow you to do anything else, or do you have flex hours?

All the best! There are plenty of opportunities out there - I'm confident you'll find something that works for you!"

Gus doesn't derseve to be holed up in a room any longer because you think the owner is a douche. You say you like the cat. Clearly the old and no vet visits isn't an issue for you since you *agreed* to take Gus knowing all that.

You are leaving Gus in a shitty situation because you no longer like who owns him. That is an asshole thing to do. 

If you truly feel you can't own him without being a horrible owner, take him in to a humane society. A humane society should focus on socilising Gus and ensuring health checks so he can go to a good home. But he's 12, it will be harder for him. People don't want an elder animal, they much rather adopt the babies or young ones. While some people do adopt senior animals, its not usual.

You say you want ""pure happiness"" but adopting from a human society might not do that. The animals in there aren't there because they lived a nice life. They are in there because their life has been shit. You will need to be more gentle and patient than usual even with kittens. Because they had such a rough life and are traumatised. I expect you will need to do the same thing with Gus. 

The only difference is you can put a face to the human and are completely aware of Gus's history.  Get Gus out of there. 

TL;DR Get Gus out of there. Gus the cat is the only non-asshole. "

**Article**:

&gt; (Reuters) - A Republican-led U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday held the second of two unusual hearings during a congressional recess in an aggressive push to confirm President Donald Trump‚Äôs conservative judicial nominees including to a liberal-leaning California-based court he often criticizes. 

&gt; Democrats, who mounted an unsuccessful effort to block Senate confirmation this month of Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, have slammed the president‚Äôs fellow Republicans for holding the hearings. Only two senators on the 21-member Judiciary Committee, both Republicans, showed up for the hearing in Washington on Wednesday in which four judicial nominees were considered. 

&gt; Democratic Senator Patty Murray, who had asked Republicans to postpone the hearing while the Senate is in recess ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional elections, criticized ‚Äúthe shameful partisan path they have taken on what has always been a bipartisan process.‚Äù She accused the Republicans of a ‚Äúmad dash‚Äù to secure confirmation. 

&gt; Two of the nominees considered on Wednesday - Bridget Bade and Eric Miller - were picked by Trump to serve on the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which handles cases arising from several western states including California. 

&gt; Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, said the committee scheduled the hearing dates with the agreement of the panel‚Äôs top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein. She disputes that. 

&gt; Trump has repeatedly criticized the 9th Circuit, which has a majority of Democratic-appointed judges and has ruled against his administration in major cases including his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries. The ban was later upheld by the conservative-majority Supreme Court. 

&gt; Trump and Senate Republican leaders have made judicial nominations a top legislative priority, as the president seeks to turn the federal judiciary more conservative. 

&gt; (For a graphic showing Trump‚Äôs impact on federal appeals courts, click: tmsnrt.rs/2PPsGtM ) 

&gt; The part of the hearing focusing on Bade, a magistrate judge from Arizona, and Eric Miller, an attorney in Seattle, lasted only 20 minutes. The two senators present were Orrin Hatch and Mike Crapo, who presided over the hearing and quizzed Bade about the proper role of judges and asked Miller about Native American tribal sovereignty. 

&gt; The hearing advanced Trump‚Äôs goal of quickly filling judicial vacancies. Trump already has appointed 29 judges to federal appeals courts, an unusually quick pace, and has moved some regional appeals courts closer to conservative control in an ideological shift that could benefit his administration. 

&gt; The other nominees considered on Wednesday were Karin Immergut as a federal district judge in Oregon and Richard Hertling for the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which handles legal claims seeking monetary judgments against the U.S. government. 

&gt; After facing a later vote in the committee, the nominees must be confirmed by the full Senate, controlled 51-49 by the Republicans.

I'm not discouraging anyone from quitting a program that is working for them. Most of the people I have seen failed to maintain their sobriety while I was attending two 12-step meetings  a day for a year. Good people, bad program. I ended up running a steps meeting (reading and discussing one chapter at a time) every Saturday after my sponsor - who originally ran the group - relapsed and moved out of state. The pattern remains the same.  
  
I quit because I didn't like Gaslighting people, telling them they were in denial of having a chronic, inbred, progressive brain disease before they could get better. I'm sure not running any diagnostic tests looking for nonexistent biomarkers indicating their biological predisposition - which isn't a predetermination - to addiction. It should be considered malpractice. 
  
""You say that pretending addiction is a disease is harmful. How so?""  
  
It‚Äôs harmful in several ways. The most obvious is that it convinces people that they have a lifelong, inbred, progressive disease, when in reality they have a behavioral problem which they can overcome. What would all the people who have quit smoking ‚Äî a majority of smokers ‚Äî do if they believed they could never quit smoking on their own? In addition, by claiming that individuals are ‚Äúpowerless‚Äù and that substances are ‚Äúpowerful,‚Äù the disease concept provides the rationale for all sorts of government intrusion into people‚Äôs lives.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution

The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution is part of the Bill of Rights. It prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. In addition, it sets requirements for issuing warrants: warrants must be issued by a judge or magistrate, justified by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and must particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.

Fourth Amendment case law deals with three main issues: what government activities are ""searches"" and ""seizures,"" what constitutes probable cause to conduct searches and seizures, and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed. Early court decisions limited the amendment's scope to physical intrusion of property or persons, but with Katz v. United States (1967), the Supreme Court held that its protections extend to intrusions on the privacy of individuals as well as to physical locations. A warrant is needed for most search and seizure activities, but the Court has carved out a series of exceptions for consent searches, motor vehicle searches, evidence in plain view, exigent circumstances, border searches, and other situations.

Mas Canosa's lawsuit takes issue with the fact that FDLE did not create formal rules for municipalities, only a document outlining ""best practices.""

The lawsuit cites a decision earlier this summer in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government entities, including police departments, generally need a warrant to access cell-phone data regarding a person's whereabouts. The decision was considered a victory for privacy advocates and leads Kruckenberg to believe license-plate data is ""the next progression in that line of thinking.""

""There‚Äôs long been this argument in the courts that whatever you show off to the public, whatever is available in public, you have no privacy interest in that,"" Kruckenberg says. ""For the first time, the court said there‚Äôs a limit.""

Also, what was massive about it compared to the 1.4 BILLION spent to support Hillary?

Speaking of billions, that much was spent to give Trump free media exposure as well by the corporate media some of it under the direction of the DNC and Hillary's campaign within their so-called ""Pied Piper Strategy"".  Toss aside a little bit of that Russia hysteria and make way for some other facts involved.

Keep in mind that this will not, on its own, re-create the exact map. It will also depend on any NewGRFs, scripts and other add-ons loaded, and what their specific settings are. Even then, there  will still be small differences. 

A better option may be to either save it as a heightmap (preserves land and sea levels/shapes, loses rivers, cities etc.), or save the entire game and then, if desired, make edits in the scenario editor."

"So first things first, I haven‚Äôt played the Spyro games for quite a few years and the first thing that took some getting used to was the new controls. My only suggestion to Toy For Bob is to add an option to make charge L3 instead of square. Movement overall felt a little off. Yea it still controls relatively the same but it still felt off to me. I also noticed I kept bumping into stuff rather frequently while charging.  

When I played back in the day I remember chasing egg thief‚Äôs by charging and jumping at the same time. That doesn‚Äôt work in RT, well it works but it‚Äôs slower than only charging.

The game overall is beautiful and I can‚Äôt wait to play the whole thing. I only can hope they add the ability to charge with L3 as it makes keeping the camera steady much easier. I know you can use an active camera but I like the freedom to look as I please. "

have the best economies. I never said anything about a ""perfect socialist state"" as I believe that we need a mix of

**Article**:

&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs planned U.S. Space Command should seek to develop ways for the country‚Äôs military to operate in outer space, White House advisers recommended on Tuesday, with the government hoping to secure approval for it by 2020. 

&gt; The National Space Council, a White House advisory panel, recommended a review of existing legal issues for military space operations and unveiled proposed legislation for Congress to create and fund a separate space agency to oversee commercial activities. 

&gt; The council‚Äôs recommendations were made at a meeting on Tuesday at the National Defense University in Washington. 

&gt; Speaking at the meeting, Vice President Mike Pence said the White House will include funding for the Space Command in the budget proposal next year, with the goal of getting approval from Congress so it can be in place by 2020. 

&gt; Pence said the National Space Council and National Security Council will review space operational authorities ‚Äúto ensure that our warfighters have the freedom and flexibility they need to deter and defeat any threat to our security in the rapidly evolving battlefield of space.‚Äù 

&gt; A lack of centralized leadership and accountability threatened U.S. ability to ‚Äúadvance our national security in space,‚Äù Pence said. ‚ÄúThe time has come to stop studying the problem and start fixing it.‚Äù 

&gt; The Trump administration in August announced an ambitious plan to usher in a new ‚ÄúSpace Force‚Äù as the sixth branch of the military by 2020. Such a change, which the Defense Department has estimated would cost $13 billon in the first five years, must first be approved by Congress. 

&gt; Pence said at an earlier Washington Post forum that China and Russia have established similar space forces. ‚ÄúThis is what our competitors are already doing. And the president is determined to make sure that America leads in space, as well, from a military standpoint,‚Äù he said. 

&gt; Critics, including some Democratic lawmakers, have said the creation of Space Command is an unnecessary and expensive bureaucratic endeavor that would simply shift work already being done well by other services like the Air Force. 

&gt; The proposed bill would also create the Bureau of Space Commerce under the U.S. Department of Commerce to liaise with industry representatives and organizations, according to a copy provided to Reuters. It also calls for $10 million per year for five years starting in 2020 to fund the commerce arm.

Plus, I feel like it opens the door for GameFream to be greedy: What if they made an evolution exclusive to a game that costs money? Adding a silly gimmic in the spin-off that adds to the evolution process is fine, making it exclusive I‚Äôm not that okay with."

Sound very liberal to brush aside the abuse problem using ‚Äúthey are are brothers‚Äù as an excuse.  We are forgetting that the fact someone is in the clergy means we should treat them with a higher standard and not give them a pass. Bergoglio has refused to address the abuse problem because he‚Äôs afraid of the real issue being brought to light. The clergy has this problem because families sent their gay sons to the clergy in the 60s and now all the sudden priest abusing little boys is a big coincidence. I think it‚Äôs obvious there is a faction within the church that seeks to constantly cover up and avoid issues such as the abuse scandal. And so unfortunately your old priest may just have the same goal.

"I think this is a really good question. All studies online show that amputees live shorter lives, but those studies all have obvious correlations with diseases and injuries (e.g. you lose a leg to diabetes so you‚Äôre probably gonna die sooner regardless of amputation). Also there is many other obvious correlations, e.g. you live in a wheelchair so you don‚Äôt exercise much.. What if a completely healthy person had his legs amputated and kept exercising and kept living healthy? Theoretically it just might increase life expectancy.."
Another desperate cry for attention
"I agree that there's freedom from hunger and freedom from lack of shelter.  But there's also freedom from other more subtle constraints, and the subtle constraints are those that are more terrifying.  

&gt;I guess my main disagreement with your claim is that it pre-supposes not only that the ultrarich are chained to increasing their wealth beyond what a (relatively) passive return would give them, but that this constraint operates on them to a greater degree than it does to the other 99% of people.  

So right now what investors do is they find young founders willing to take all the risk and give them money.  The founders are the ones who can change the world _because_ they don't have money, because they don't have to balance a portfolio of investments where they expect a return.  The founders are getting a raw deal but they get to take a risk and maybe make a real dent.  

Investors are known to be herd animals: what's considered a safe investment is basically considered safe because investors all talk to one another.  They're not _actually_ better at making opportunities appear or capitalizing on them; they're more of an ambient money device.  

This all functions as a series of rudimentary checks on businesses and handholds for people getting into the start of a business.  It makes a lot of sense and functions remarkably well.  

But it relies on letting investors think they have special insight in the future of the market, when really they're just... all gambling.  Smarter gambling than Vegas, but gambling just the same.  You pick 20 companies and hope 1 of them makes it big enough to wash out the loss of the other 19.  

All about managing risk.  It's smart.  It keeps the money safe.  

And it's none of the hard work and none of the bravery and none of the world-changing.  

Do you see?  **If you want to change the world, you cannot have money to start with.**  "

It's like if someone doesn't like hamburgers and they don't go to Burger King, and you ask them ""but do you go to McDonalds?""  No, they don't like hamburgers.  Why would they have anything to do with a hamburger joint?  The reason for the atheism is presumably because the idea of believing in something without some kind of proof or rationale isn't how they roll.

"well theyre set up in the exact opposite way

one is super strong and fast, great observation haki  and hasn't been hit in years

the other is a total tank, never tries dodging anything, has strong armament and takes a million hits but just keeps going like a damn terminator

so maybe katakuri would keep hitting jack and jack couldnt hit him, but it would be a stalemate

say he can fluster katakuri to cancel out his future sight to get some hits in, id say jacks damage potential could definitely do some solid hits

but if katakuri started doing his serious attacks im pretty sure he could get through jacks tankiness, as legendary as it is

hard call, id say from what we know now, katakuri wins with a lot of difficulty and a long fight

"I'd say the opposite. My chest really popped once I hit 4 plate bench. Training on a planned progression on the main 3 lifts provided me an easy way to know that I was providing progressive overload to myself and actually growing rather than treading water. For anyone not already at an elite level getting stronger will make it look like you are stronger. It doesn't matter whether that's a new 10RM or a 1RM.

OP doesn't even mention bodybuilding vs powerlifting but that's what I'm going to assume he's comparing. I'm not sure how Strongmen train in the lead up to event, but they do a lot of conditioning so I'd suspect they're quite happy to work in high rep ranges anyway. The only time bodybuilders and powerlifters really train that differently is in the lead up to a comp, a powerlifter does a peaking cycle to extract all of their muscular ""potential"" (that's the only time they're really serious about high intensity lifting) to get the highest 1RM they can and the bodybuilder does whatever they need to to maintain their muscle mass while cutting hard. 

The rest of the time they both do a lot of work on hypertrophy, both want to build as much muscle as they can because once you've naile technique and all the other neural adaptions, more muscle = stronger. The powerlifter is probably slightly more tied to the big three lifts, but there's nothing bad about them from an aesthetic point of view either. For a power lifting anecdote I've just finished 6 months only doing safety bar squats because I'm only training for a push pull event, and wanted to mix it up a bit. So even then it's flexible. "

Try Doom &amp; Destiny. Once paid for it can be played offline. Great mobile RPG.
so the curve must be really fat right? 
"I can agree that they should remain predictable. Maybe they could just keep the same exp from them, except instead of giving you straight up exp make it give bonus exp (the current proposed change would be bonus exp but at a reduced rate; they could just keep the same rates though then you can be doing actual Div training to level up, but at exp rates that aren't ass, and at the end of the day you'd be getting the same benefits from the cache, in terms of total exp gained.)"

"The economy shifted to a service economy (blame stagflation) and technology, open trade agreements, and foreign competition (Cold War policies, inevitable recovery of the world economy, Farm crisis) eroded blue collar jobs. We produce less so there is now more economic value on ideas/services and less on skills. This means that if you want to become/be middle/upper-middle class you need a college education or to learn one of the skills/trades that are still valuable.

&amp;#x200B;

Trades are still a viable option for middle class lifestyles, but there are increasingly fewer options for unskilled/uneducated workers. No coal mines to go down into, no steel factory to work in. Etc. "

I think this was very well done. In the case of Meruem can it be said that all thought the name was originally chosen by the queen as a sign of her plans for him as you said  alll the trials that he had to go throught to earn that name repesents him recaming it compeltly for himself as an individual against her intent? After all he never knows what his name means or that his mom intend it symbolizes him as the ruler of the world and he dosent care to find out what it means. He sees it just as proof of his existence as an individual outside of his born role as the king and dies seeing it as such.

"So you are giving conflicting comments. Earlier you said Israel has made mistakes, and now you are saying they are blameless.

I'm getting a heavy handed vibe from you. It's pointless of us to discuss a middle east solution, they are the only ones who can fix this. However I will say if Israeli leadership has your holier than thou attitude and pretends they are blameless, there will never be peace. If one side doesn't conquer the other, than they need to work it out themselves."

"My experience exactly. I went for a friend's wedding in Vegas, but I don't go back, because feeling that desirable is addictive.

I'm fairly popular, I have two groups of ~10 friends that I love to death and a girlfriend who makes me unbelievably happy. Life is good.

So understand when I say that the sudden sense being desirable like you have (and, unfortunately, probably never will be) is immensely addictive. You go in thinking it'll feel fake, but it really doesn't. Those girls are good at what they do.

On a tangent, I made good friends with a stripper who was waiting for her shift to end, even though she was fully aware that my wallet was empty and I wouldn't be coming back. She was actually putting herself through the local police academy.. I can't remember her name (I presume it was a stage name anyway), but I hope things are going well for her."

"The new chat box is utter garbage, a slap in the face of every player, a shame for a once respectable game company. /u/Magyst Relay that unfiltered to the dev team.

Whoever was responsible for releasing it in this stage of development needs their butt kicked. (i.e. fired). Relay that to the higher-ups.

Just think for a moment how users would react to software quality as rotten as Fortnite's in Operating systems or Productivity software. They would boycott it, and rightfully so, because it is just not usable.
The same standards should again be applied to games. The dev team needs to start treating the players with respect by conducting proper QA and not releasing unfinished pre-alpha garbage."

"Controversial opinion time: A team that can't compete with the best shouldn't be given a guaranteed slot to Blizzcon.  And minor regions have proven, time and time again, that they can't compete.

Let's go through some of the other major tourneys of past years, and see the highest placement that minor regions obtained in them.

* 2015 World Championship (Blizzcon): Highest minor region placement is Taiwan in 8th place....out of 8 teams.
* 2016 Spring Global: All minor regions eliminated in group stage 1 (9th-12th).
* 2016 Fall Global (Blizzcon): All minor regions except for Taiwan eliminated in group stage 1, finishing 9th or below.  Taiwan was eliminated in group stage 2 and finished 6th.
* 2017 HGC Western Clash Phase 1: Latam finished 8th with an 0-4 game record, ANZ finished 7th with a 2-4 game record.
* 2017 HGC Eastern Clash Phase 1: Taiwan and SEA both finish 0-4, tied for 7th-8th.
* 2017 HGC Mid-Season Brawl: Only ANZ gets out of group stages, finishing in 7th-8th place.
* 2017 HGC Western Clash Phase 2: Latam finishes 0-4, and ANZ finishes 1-4.  8th and 7th respectively.
* 2017 HGC Eastern Clash Phase 2: Taiwan gets two slots and finishes 5th and 6th, SEA finishes 1-4 in 7th.
* 2017 HGC Finals: All four minor region teams eliminated in group stages, finishing 13th-16th.
* 2018 HGC Mid-Season Brawl: Taiwan finishes 0-5 in groups and in 12th place, ANZ went 1-4 in a 10th place finish.

It's true that minor regions need a chance to play internationally too if they're going to grow, which is why I'm in favor of giving them back their spots to the Clash like they had in 2017....but frankly, they should have to *earn* spots to the Mid-Season Brawl or to Blizzcon.  Slots shouldn't be given away to a minor region team unless that team has truly proven they're of sufficient strength to be there.  And I don't think there's enough of a body of proof yet that minor regions should be there.

If I can find the time, maybe I'll elaborate on my own thoughts for a better system for minor regions that will hopefully give them more experience *without* giving them free passes to the MSB or Blizzcon....but work is kinda kicking my butt right now, so I don't know how soon that'll be."

"For your situation my guess would be that he really is just trying to keep the peace. It sounds like she is difficult to deal with and it is just easier to let stuff go than fight. In custody situations the woman has benefit over the man just because she is the mother so he may not want to risk more custody battles. Plus more disputes are often sensed by kids and causes them stress even if it‚Äôs not done in front of them. My ex and his children‚Äôs mother were always at each other‚Äòs throats. it was really sad to see the effect it had on the kids even if they didn‚Äôt hear it. Being vindictive bred more vindictiveness to the point of vacations being ruined. 

I can relate to a degree. This really isn‚Äôt directly about step parent issues. Sometimes I feel like I am held to different standards then his ex-wife. Like she got away with so much over 10 years but it‚Äôs not tolerated with me at all.

"&gt;Have you really used ''they'' for specific individuals all your life? 

Absolutely, I use ""they"" to refer to a single person all the time. It's actually not that awkward in use.

""I was supposed to meet with a friend on Saturday, but everything fell through. They said they were going to be late, but they had to let their cat out first. By the time they arrived, I needed to leave. I miss them already.""

&gt; Do you refer to your mother as ''they''?

Honestly, I do switch through usage pretty frequently. Sometimes I will use ""she"", others I will use ""they"".

----

I would posit that how often someone uses ""they"" for single pronoun use might be regional/dialectical.

It's possible that you are from a region or culture that uses it less frequently, so it sounds awkward when the word is said. I would be from a region that uses it more often, so I would naturally use it anyway."

"Yeah, but I've seen too many movies about trans people starring cis people, written by cis people, and directed by cis people. They just don't understand what it's like and more often than not have a harmful depiction. We hate being correlated with our assigned gender and nothing feels more like a slap in the face is seeing a cis women play a trans man or a cis man play a trans women.

Honestly, we have a good idea as what harms us and what doesn't. An ounce of misrepresentation can lead to years of torment and repression. My first experiences with trans women was from Ace Ventura, Silence of the Lambs, and an episode of Jerry Springer where the crowd boo'd and shamed a trans woman without ever considering that listening to her might give them different ideas as to what it's like. You want stories about trans people, hire trans actors, there's quite a few."

"Gilroy has spoken before about what a mess *Rogue One* was in when he came on board, and has basically taken credit for saving the production.  In the other interview, some months ago, he said some pretty damning things, including, IIRC, that (at that point) the main characters had no motivation whatever and that nobody seemed to know what the film was supposed to even be *about*.  I remember this causing quite a flurry among those who were still claiming it was all ""just normal re-shoots"".

Now, of course, what really matters is the finished product, not what it took to get there- however, in this case it blew some extra holes in the narrative that everything was happening for the best in the best of all possible Disney/Lucasfilms.  Which is a thing- it appears some people are fans, not so much of any particular movie or of *Star Wars* in general, but of *the company*, or else of the general concept of ""New Star Wars"" or ""Disney Star Wars"".  Or something.  I can't really pretend to understand it.  I know these were also the ones who consistently welcomed director firings as a sign of quality control and had complete and utter meltdowns when *Solo* flopped.  Yes, that was partly because the latter was being attributed to TLJ backlash, but there was more to it- there were plenty who just couldn't bear to contemplate  the thought that the ""powers that be"" were capable of *any* mistakes of *any* kind.  Weird."

"I would run box spring support slats perpendicular to the way you will be laying.  As you have it designed, all of your weight will be concentrated between the two supports (assuming two people will be in this bed).  Most box springs for king beds are actually two twin box springs.  In this case, the only support your box spring will have is on the sides which is not good for the box spring.  With proper slats, you can ditch the center support, and add a cleat to each side rail.  I've only had one bed that had a center support, but it was a ""leg"" attached to one of the box spring slats, not an actual rail.  If you do want to keep the rail, I would still add the slats, but make sure the slats lie on top of the center beam."

**Article**:

&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Medical treatment will be more widely available to opioid abusers while mailing illicit drugs will be more difficult under a measure to fight drug addiction that was signed into law on Wednesday by U.S. President Donald Trump. 

&gt; In a year more typically marked by partisan gridlock, Trump signed the rare bipartisan package passed by Congress earlier this month to tackle a problem that led to a record 72,000 drug overdose deaths in 2017. 

&gt; The legislation expands access to substance abuse treatment in Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled; cracks down on mailed shipments of illicit drugs such as fentanyl, a synthetic opioid far more powerful than heroin; and provides a host of new federal grants to address the crisis. 

&gt; The Senate passed the measure by a vote of 98-1 in September after a 353-52 vote in favor in the House. The bill had 252 bipartisan cosponsors in the House, more than almost any other bill in recent years, according to website GovTrack Insider. 

&gt; Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency last year, which enabled the government to respond more quickly to crises. But addiction experts, advocacy groups and Democrats said the administration was not doing enough. 

&gt; On Tuesday, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Patty Murray released a U.S. Government Accountability Office report that they said showed Trump‚Äôs emergency declaration fell short of his promises. The report said the government has used few of the powers it could use, under the declaration. 

&gt; ‚ÄúHand waving about faster paperwork and speeding up a few grants is not enough. The Trump administration needs to do far more to stop the opioid epidemic,‚Äù Warren said in a statement. 

&gt; Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said the criticism from the senators was ‚Äúpredictable and unfortunately very partisan,‚Äù noting that both voted for the opioids legislation. 

&gt; In addition to educating the public and expanding access to treatment, Conway said the administration was also focused on securing the border with Mexico to stop drugs from coming into the United States.

"Like all your points. The chair they took from the crime scene seems to be the most telling evidence I‚Äôve seen so far. I‚Äôm new to this so not sure what I‚Äôm able to say or not say only giving my assessment of some things.

I‚Äôve seen it posted where the neighbors thought the gun could be a shotgun bc it was so loud. This chair has splintering on the seat which would only have been caused by a handgun. If a loud handgun my guess something like a .44 magnum revolver. That gun is extremely powerful and loud. 2 shots were said to be heard in succession. Possibly 1 shot was a miss and struck the chair. The other shot likely the kill shot to the father. It doesn‚Äôt state anywhere I‚Äôve seen that the mother was shot as well unless I missed something so she could have been killed by another method.  That chair could still have the bullet imbedded in it - significant evidence if so.

I tend to think this wasn‚Äôt random. Someone planned for this, at least parts of it. Scenarios could have came up that weren‚Äôt originally planned for such as Jayme being present or the father being home and it changed the course of the perps initial plan.  All speculation but I can‚Äôt imagine something as sinister as this would go exactly as planned.

I also like the ATV theory. Many quick escape routes possible with an ATV. They even make quiet ATV‚Äôs for hunting purposes. The vehicles of interest could have been the only ones pass on a single video evidence they have in the timeline they‚Äôre looking for - they could be involved or they could be just a passerby from wherever the video evidence came from.

All theories here but I would welcome any comments if I‚Äôve misspoke at all."

It might be if the thing that was annoying is nerfed out, but I've already seen some cases (like Villager's slingshot) where it seems to be just as aggravating.

The one single thing I am most scared of, however, is Little Mac not free falling after his Jolt Haymaker anymore. He was already super frustrating in a good player's hands on for glory, so straight buffing him sounds like a nightmare. At least he should only appear on Omega stages, assuming we get to fight on both FD and BF variants online."

"I think on some level cooking is seen and used as a way to express interest. Like, the main character will cook for a character she likes or the love interest will compliment her on her cooking. I have to admit it feels great when someone I love (platonic or romantically) compliments me on something I cooked. That said, hate when female characters who can't cook are the punchlines of jokes, it's an essential life skill for any adult and not something that should be expected just because you're a certain gender.

You also often see in Japanese media where characters will make bento for each other or share a homemade lunch, and how that often gets tied up as something only close friends or people who are romantically linked will do (or in some cases it's done to repay a favor).

And when you have a group of characters who are living in the same town or house/dorm, cooking and meals serves as a good reason to get them all together. It's a very social activity in most any culture. It's also easy to establish interesting new facts about a character or reinforce previously established traits by how they cook, how they eat, what foods they like, etc. Maybe they're usually sloppy or seem unreliable but they're excellent cooks because they had to take care of siblings. Maybe a stoic character is surprisingly picky about eating a certain veggie. Maybe they drive the point home that the no-nonsense kuudere really is no-nonsense because he/she just has basic ingredients to make the same 3 meals in their kitchen, as they eat only what they need to survive. There's just a lot of potential with meal scenes, so writers often fall back on it.

I don't really hate cooking or meal scenes, but there are times when they drag on. Has a lot more to do with the writing and what they're trying to achieve in the scene, if it's a well-done character building moment or serious discussion is going on it's a lot easier for me to not even notice it's the 25th kitchen moment of the game. Black Butterfly was definitely kinda like... ""oh, good. They're cooking again. :|"" but given the setting there was only so much to do, lol. "

"Ever played Fallout? It's simple; if the origins were nuclear explosions (as mentioned on Lapa vlog) multiple degrees of radiation were caused on the world. The higher the radiation, the worse.

The unfortunate ones who were hit by high radiation, weren't so lucky. Some straight died, others turned into ghouls. There's also ""levels"" of radiactivity on a ghoul. Some of them are still capable of acting like a human person, however their skins deteriorated. This also means they adapted to radiation, but only partially because it was too strong. Most ghouls completely lost their mind, barely alive, as zombie-like thingies. They're vicious, and attack any living being on sight.

NOW, I know why I cannot ride long distances on the scooter, NOW, I know why I am 'crippled' for 05 minutes after I get off the Burgman; having to hang on it him, to keep from falling down. Thus it is also a question of how much longer I can ride a scooter-any scooter, before I am 'Unsafe at Any Speed"" (hint thats a book title).

It's a good idea to keep checking, but dollars to donuts, they won't find any particular cause. The only real thing to check for is a pituitary problem, but the prolactin was not high (pituitary tumor usually causes that) and the TSH was (I am guessing without a range) okay. Beyond that, the question becomes whether or not you are capable of having kids because TRT carries a small but real risk of causing permanent infertility. "

"Allow me to share some information since many opt to knee jerk whine about everything instead of actually exploring the gameplay systems already in place.

There is a tiered mission system in which you get offered higher paying missions as you complete earlier tiers. The following were taken directly from 3.2 live


Tier 1

https://i.imgur.com/uh0Qgu8.jpg

Tier 2 

https://i.imgur.com/WkbZL8e.jpg


Tier 3

https://i.imgur.com/gMHiGZF.jpg

Tier 4

https://i.imgur.com/FHE6VK2.jpg

And those are just from the General-Mercenary category of missions. There are other categories with up to 5 mission tiers and not to mention the unlockable mission givers (Eckhart and Ruto with more coming in 3.3 and beyond) that always offer you missions as soon as you spawn in a server (hint: you can hop servers over and over and you'll keep getting offered new missions from those NPC mission givers IF you bothered to unlock them).

The same thing applies to other aspects of the game like mining for example. If you are going around mining every single low quality rock out there instead of devoting time to PROSPECT (gee what a concept) you are going to have terrible earnings per time invested and deservedly so.

This is all from a single mining route that I've mapped out on Yela in total it's about an hour or so worth of gameplay. 


https://i.imgur.com/KaUH6qT.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/5KRJUgy.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/Qpj5Ir0.jpg


I'll let you do the math and consider that was not as profitable because the Agricium concentration on those rocks was low. I've mined rocks that are 11%+ and you get 9-11k from them easily.


https://i.imgur.com/cCvIxnZ.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/o03Ctib.jpg


But I suspect that regardless of any information some people are spoonfed they will still whine with entitlement expecting welfare handouts.

P.S: And I'm also completely ignoring the Drug lab trading runs because I never run it as I consider that place another form of welfare that should be removed from the game.

P.P.S: I should do a video on one of my 3.2 mining runs so people can see it done."
I reset mine recently and now it kinda just does whatever it wants thinking typos are words.

"&gt;If you don't know how can you say there isn't any?

Isn't any what? Gods? I never said there wasn't. I said there isn't any good reason to believe in them. That's perfectly compatible with my lack of knowledge about the beginning of the universe.

&gt;It's anyone's job who cares to think about it.

No. Not really. My mind if finite and will eventually die. I'm not going to spend my time thinking about all the possible causes of the universe without some place to start. And as of yet we don't have a place to start. I'm certainly not going to start with unsubstantiated claims about gods."

Flint and steel was essential. Basically we would switch from our sword to our fns so quickly you couldn‚Äôt even see the flint and steel in your hand and put a fire where the player is standing exactly, all this in like 1 second. This took me a whole month to learn I swear to god

Bow strafing was really hard too. We would shoot an arrow, dodge the arrow the opponent shot and block our swords really quickly to reduce the damage dealt.

Whether or not you win is very dependent on what deck you're up against. I lose against mono red probably 99% of the time but by contrast win against merfolk decks by the same margin. It does decent against control decks because you can often throw out more rat colonies than they can remove.My average wins in constructed with the deck is about 4.8, not the best but enough for infinite grinding and better than any other deck I can afford right now. Playstyle is simple, get out lots of rats (mostly only need 4) then throw one of the blues down and get the win.

"&gt;Have you really used ''they'' for specific individuals all your life? 

Absolutely, I use ""they"" to refer to a single person all the time. It's actually not that awkward in use.

&gt; Do you refer to your mother as ''they''?a

Honestly, I do switch through usage pretty frequently. Sometimes I will use ""she"", others I will use ""they"". Depends on the situation.

----

I would posit that how often someone uses ""they"" as a single-person-pronoun might be regional/dialectical.

It's possible that you are from a region or culture that uses it less frequently, so it sounds awkward when the word is said. I would be from a region that uses it more often, so I would naturally use it anyway."

I have a question:

&gt;... here comes a moral reason. Many porn stars and amateur starlets have a quite shitty life, with drugs and stuff. You could watch two documentaries: Hot Girls Wanted, and After Porn Ends. Even by watching free stuff, you contribute to that shit. To lives being ruined. 

What would say if somebody responds with ""Well, I don't watch porn per se. Instead I just use the gonewild subreddit and just beat it to pics/gifs. Girls post their own stuff and I don't see how it contributes to anything bad."" 

Rationally, I agree that porns does harm regardless if it's produced by a company in which the porn stars are usually abused/mistreated/taken advantage of or produced by the users themselves (as in some NSFW subreddits with mostly original content (OC)). However, I sometimes find myself giving the benefit of the doubt to the NSFW subreddits. I don't do it that often (at most twice a week) but do it nonetheless."

"Terse always wins for me.

A really illuminating example is Verilog's `begin` and `end` which are the `{` and `}` of the language, delimiting block scopes.

Which is more legible?

This:

    always @* begin
      if (foo==2) begin
        do_stuff;
      end else begin
        do_other_stuff;
      end
    end

or this:

    always @* {
      if (foo==2) {
        do_stuff;
      } else {
        do_other_stuff;
      }
    }

Personally I find the long keywords to be extremely noisy compared to the symbolic versions.  But at least I don't have to type `semicolon` I guess.

As an aside, the terseness/verbosity spectrum is not absolute - it depends on the audience.  What's ""terse"" for someone used to programming in Java is way different than for someone used to programming in Perl.  So if you're designing a language to appeal to people from a certain background, keep that in mind."

"Couple of legal principles and misconceptions to clear up:
- Every original song has two separate properties covered by copyright ‚Äî the sound recording (traditionally owned by the record label) and the music composition (usually owned by the songwriter/composer but frequently licensed and administered by separate music publishers)
- Minaj‚Äôs song doesn‚Äôt use a ‚Äúsample‚Äù (which would be an excerpt of the copyright protected sound recording) but it does infringe Chapman‚Äôs copyright in the musical composition.
- Since she doesn‚Äôt use an actual sample, Minaj could actually have replayed the entire Chapman song (music composition) without Chapman‚Äôs explicit permission by invoking the compulsory license that US copyright law provides for (and paying a statutory rate for this) BUT the compulsory license doesn‚Äôt permit you to change the lyrics.

Some additional points:
- This arrangement of ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù (Baby Can I Hold You Tonight) would be very familiar to reggae fans; a Jamaican singer called Foxy Brown (not the rapper) released this very arrangement (including the drum, piano and bass instrumentation by reggae producers Steelie &amp; Clevie) in the late 1980s. It was a massive hit in reggae circles; this and Brown‚Äôs cover of ‚ÄúFast Car,‚Äù was how many reggae fans (including this one) got introduced to Tracy Chapman whose folk arrangements of the same songs didn‚Äôt really get urban radio or club play. 
- If Minaj wanted to make a really ballsy play, she should have sampled the Foxy Brown version including the lyrics (actually it sounds close to a sample) and then claimed the compulsory license. If Chapman had either licensed the Brown arrangement (or hadn‚Äôt previously sued to prevent its release in 1989) it‚Äôd be more difficult for her to win against the new Minaj version (which is essentially the Brown arrangement).
- On the fact patterns, it‚Äôll be hard to get substantial damages since Minaj‚Äôs version wasn‚Äôt commercially released. That‚Äôs typically the mixtape loophole (not an actual legal protection but just a practical limitation where commercial impact and intent is harder to prove). Chapman might have better success with a claim for statutory damages, which could go as high as $150,000 if she could prove willful infringement."

* Omelettes. Eggs are super cheap, get some cheese at Costco, gyoumu-super, etc., load up on veggies that are in season. If you're trying to cut calories Aeon has low-fat shredded cheese.

* Greek yogurt--Aeon or make your own by draining commercial yogurt (gets rid of the whey which has most of the carbs in yogurt). You could mix with Calbee's ""sugar-cut"" granola that might fit your needs depending on how much you're restricting carbs.

* Brine some chicken breasts and grill them (they're too dry for me without some sort of brining/marinating). 

* Mackerel, Sanma, tons of delicious oily fishes all around you.

* Katsuo-tataki on a bed of greens; katsuo-tataki was on sale the other day here for ¬•81/100g. It actually freezes okay so stock up when it's cheap.

Warframe, unless DE and their parent company grow to be a truly colossal AAA conglomerate the likes of Activision-Vinendi taking in billions each quarter, is in no position to strip their prized jewel bare and delicately reassemble it.

Seriously though; set your ping limit to 100 so you can usually host yourself and have others join, or run with a clan/premade. Migrations are not that common unless you're putting yourself in positions where they can happen (white connections, playing with ransoms, being toxic/encouraging toxic behaviour).

I agree that they suck. They're the singular most frustrating aspect of the game, beyond any grinds or RNG. But they're core to Warframe's growth as a cost-cutting measure, and without them and our peer-to-peer system, Warframe would've been a lot more expensive to start playing, as in, 'not a free-for-all at game.' And that would've killed it immediately.

"&gt;Why would a non-white individual from another planet want to perpetuate racism towards blacks?

I had enough trouble getting my mind around the idea of racism (such as we know it today) existing in the far future. (the story did not explicitly state it but implied it.)

in answer to your question: perhaps because s/he did not want her people to get along with white people and thought that Rosa Parks enabled that to happen.

&gt;Why would a woman want to perpetuate the ideals of a time in which she still wouldn't be equal to men? 

perhaps she might like the racism and put up with the sexism for long enough to accomplish her task. perhaps she might even like the sexism, too. (how about female suicide bombers? they kill themselves in service of a sexist society, don't they?)

&gt;Father's Day had a time traveler (namely a companion) cause the problem, so if it wasn't a third party, who would it be?

perhaps a time traveler sympathetic to Rosa Parks. perhaps, as in ""Father's Day"", the Doctor, against her better judgement, allows her companions to meet Rosa Parks (or even see her from afar), which then, for some reason, causes history to alter. 

&gt; And artistically, that the Doctor's fight mirroring that era's fight is completely valid and normal. To say it's propaganda simply because they made the most obvious choice is kinda silly.

to say they made the obvious choice more or less indicates that you have some awareness of sort of propagandistic purpose the episode served. works of fiction not intended for propagandistic purpose, if written well, contain surprises. they don't make the obvious choices. 

""Rosa"" had a) a villain (which, as I have shown, it did not need to have) and b) a white, cisgendered (presumably) white male villain. any other choice would have undercut the propagandistic message. you would have a *Doctor Who* story concerning Rosa Parks but not necessarily a work of propaganda."

"Every human now has a maximum ""Empathy"" score."
"""Strategy Game with Barries"" seems like not a great tagline for people who don't know what Barries are.

Before Rules to Start maybe an overall summary of what the goal is or something. Is it two players, three? What do I want to accomplish to win? (Oh, I see you get around to that at step 6, but it's nice to mention it at the start so you have context for everything else you read.)

When you put the boards together, which sides should be together? (I guess the boards are the things with the fatigue zones, but I don't know if the front line is the side with the fatigue zones or the opposite, or the top or what.)

We put two boards together, but now we place 6 Barries on the Board. But now there's only one board? Do you mean I can only place them on my board? 

What's a Barry range block? I thought we were placing Barries, now we also have to place range blocks? (Oh wait, you mean Barries have a property named range, and you're using blocks as a measurement of distance. I eventually figured this out but I'm leaving my first impression here so you can learn from it.)

What are the Number Tiles for? Do I choose which number to put under which Barry?

Push the Barries past which line on the board? You mean the fatigue zone?

The ""Turns go like this"" you list all the actions, but you should organize the information about those actions according to that. You're listing everything in these lists of 6 entries per page but describing turns is worth organizing as a sub-list, where you list each action you take, and any info important to that action together. So for example all your stuff under How to Attack should be explained inside of the part of your turn where you attack.

And if Barries in the fatigue zone take 5 Damage, that should be mentioned in whatever part of the turn that takes place. Does that count as a status effect, so it takes place then? And you need to say whether you restore health first and then deal damage or vice versa, or some other order, because there's times where that could decide whether they survive or not.

When do I move my Barries forward? You didn't actually list that in ""Turns go like this""

""Repeat if there is still space"" Space where? What if my furthest-forward Barry isn't in the same lane as his furthest-forward Barry? Do we go past each other since there's space for them to move, or do I have to stop there no matter which lane it's in so the ""front line"" is straight across?

Can I ever have two enemy Barries in range at once? Do I get to choose which one to attack? You mention ""the attacked enemy"" but didn't say how I choose which one I'm attacking.

I notice in Rules during Battle you mention the prospect of an enemy being knocked into the Fatigue Zone, but neither there or in How to Attack do you actually say how or when do you knock them back.

In How to Attack 4 you say what to do if you knock them out, and then in 5 you say it's the opponent's turn. But earlier you said if you knock them out you can roll again. Right here, between 4 &amp; 5, that's where you should mention you can roll again. That's where it makes sense to mention it.

The way you describe hit points is a little confusing.

&gt; ""Mark how much damage was taken by subtracting the current Hit Points (HP) from the Maximum Hit Points (MaxHP), or by removing Armor if there is Armor.

If I have a Barry with a Max Hit Points of 30, then their current Hit Points should also be 30. If you subtract 30 from 30 you get 0. So now their current hit points is zero? So next time I subtract 0 from 30 and then it's 30 again?

But then right after that you talk about instead of subtracting from Hit Points you were supposed to be recording damage and if the damage gets higher that MaxHP they're knocked out. But Armor still works the other way? I think either subtract from both or count up for both, keep it consistent.

Plus when you said remove Armor you didn't say how much Armor I should remove.


EDIT: 

So I think the most important is organize according to the actions you can take in a turn. Rules during Battle doesn't really mean much because the whole game is a battle, right? How to Attack isn't good because you have separate stages during your turn for ""roll die for attacking"" and then ""actually attack.""

(And I'm reminded you have between those, check battlefield/activate Trickery. You don't mention Trickery anywhere else, so I don't know what that's about, and what am I checking the battlefield for? Is that really one stage or is it two? First check battlefield, and then activate Trickery?)

Plus you're saying Barries can move before attacking, so then list that in actions you can take each turn.

So yeah, make an absolute list of actions you can take each turn, with a clear unambiguous sequence. Absolutely everything the player can do, it should be very clear at what stage of that list do they do it? Moving? Put that in the list. Roll again because they knocked someone out? Put that in the list."

"The Malala point is Islam not right-wing. Muslims believe in holding women back, the right believes in equality regardless of race, gender, or religion. 

And I could easily bring up leftist terrorist groups, such as ANTIFA who has the same ‚Äúanti-fascist‚Äù ideology as the Red Army Faction had who kidnapped, bombed and assassinated people.

You have leftist politicians who constantly promote violence against the right such as Maxine Waters and Hilary Clinton. Conservatives never promote violence. 

I‚Äôm not denying there‚Äôs right-winged extremists, but we disavow them while the left praises ANTIFA and BLM. "

"Dude, never go back to her. If she didn‚Äôt care enough about being there for you at an incredibly low moment then she doesn‚Äôt love you. Part of relationships is being there for your partner for difficult periods. It‚Äôs not always going to be attractive. It‚Äôs not always going to be beautiful. It‚Äôs not always going to be happy. There‚Äôs going to be periods where you aren‚Äôt as attracted to each other. But a strong relationship where there is unconditional love and mutual respect for each other is the foundation that will allow you to support your partner during those times of trial.

This hits close to home for me as a girl left me for someone else the night my mother died earlier this year. It‚Äôs a permanent breaking of trust that can never be fully repaired. It‚Äôs also a demonstration of a serious lack of respect from your SO. Imagine if the situations were switched and you broke up with her right after a close family member passed? Cut your losses and move on, someone even more special and worthy of you is out there waiting."

I have been wondering if this might be strategic, actually. One of the only times in recent history where the president's party bucked the midterm trend of losing a significant number of seats was 1998, during the height of the Starr investigation, and a lot of people blamed the impeachment drumbeat for Republican losses that cycle. There just wasn't an appetite in the country for impeaching Clinton, and it hurt them.

Anyway, I'll be interested to see whether prominent elected Dems start talking about it more after midterms."

"Per Wikipedia
&gt;These policies are commonly associated with supply-side economics, referred to as trickle-down economics or voodoo economics by political opponents, and free-market economics by political advocates.

""Voodoo economics"" and ""Trickle Down"" are mere political jargon used to criticize was is essentially Supply Side Economics, or as I like to call it ""economics.""

The financial industry doesn't use the term ""voodoo economics"" because we actually know and understand economics. We don't need to add political modifiers to discuss the actual disciplines of economics (i.e. game theory, financial economics, micro/macro, etc..)

&gt;I wonder why you chose cancer to show the superiority of the US health care system, rather than all diseases: GRAPH 2013

&gt;Also the US has a high rate of mortality related to health care itself: GRAPH 2002-2007

I use cancer because it is the bleeding edge of medical research and has been for the last 3 decades. When you need life saving healthcare for an acute disease like cancer, America is still the place to go.

The first graph you cite is more related to American diet and lifestyle than the American healthcare system. ""disease of the circulatory system"" aka heart disease. Per the CDC:
&gt;Americans at Risk for Heart Disease
High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About half of Americans (47%) have at least one of these three risk factors.

&gt;Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including:
&gt;Diabetes

&gt;Overweight and obesity

&gt;Poor diet

&gt;Physical inactivity

&gt;Excessive alcohol use 

The second graph is also somewhat related to diet because the study it is based on uses heart disease as a weighted factor when deciding which deaths are amenable to health care. 

&gt;We also included ischemic heart disease, hereafter referred to as heart disease. Consistent with earlier work, we considered only 50 percent of heart disease deaths as amenable. This decision was informed by a recent comprehensive review of the evidence that suggests that 40‚Äì50 percent of the decline in heart disease mortality in industrialized countries can be attributed to improvements in health care. 21,22 Throughout this article, the term amenable mortality thus always includes 50 percent of the deaths from heart disease.

The major issues would be fricatives and affricates, clusters, coda stops, and the vowels. There are also prosody issues since it's a machine gun language, and rising the pitch to mark questions wouldn't feel intuitive at all.

Tar√∫ne (central dialect): [hi …ªi:‚Åød¬≤.se - w√§t is hi …ªi:¬≤.…æi·∂Æ…ü - hu:¬≥ is hi - tis ‚Åøde.p√§…™‚Åød¬≥.se ·µêb√∏t hu:¬≥ ti:·∂Æ…ü¬≤.se tis is imb√§ ä…ª¬≥t√§‚Åød - hi ·µêba…™t¬≤ ·µêbi som¬πw√§‚Åød ‚Åødej¬≤me‚Åød  ù√§…™c¬≥ - wy ·µêba…™t¬≥ ‚Åøda…™¬≤we…ª ‚Åødow¬≥ inde fy:¬≥ty…ª - jes... now]

The biggest issue here is the lack of phonemic contrast between voiced oral and nasal stops - ""might"" and ""bite"" are homophones. &lt;in the&gt; get merged because /i‚Åød:e/ would be read as [inde], close enough.

An epenthetic /e/ pops up to render syllables (C)V(C). Northerners would add an [h] in any syllable lacking an attack, or force them together if the word before ended in a consonant.

English stressed syllables are a bit longer, so the speakers might be tempted to use long vowels. This is fine... except /e:/ and /o:/ get broken into [√§…™] and [√§ ä]. Southerners don't do that, but they might render English /√§…™/ and /√§ ä/ as [e:] and [o:] instead.

[…ªi:.…æi·∂Æ…ü] assumes an English dialect with flapping. If they went in a time machine to their prehistory (our time) and ended in Scotland, they might use [ri:. îi·∂Æ…ü] instead.

Word starting /w j/ is realized differently depending on the dialect - [v …£] for Northerners, [Œ≤  ù] for Centrals, [w j] for Southerners. But even in Southerner speech there's a slight fricativization, so it would still feel off.

For most part velars would become palatals. They might be tempted to use uvulars instead? 

Their intonation would be really weird for English speakers, like they're ""singing"" due to the pitch accent. 1 = high vowel, 2 = rising, 3 = falling. Everything else is taken as low pitch."

"Let me tell you my perspective....

About a year ago I went from a 60 hz IPS monitor to the Dell S2417DG. I was so excited and thought I was going to see a HUGE difference in frames and my KD ratio would instantly double. Once I started using it I couldn't tell a difference in my frames. I checked over and over to make sure I had the monitor setting correct and the Nvidia settings correct, but still couldn't notice anything. I searched online and came across a website with spaceships that would detect a 144 hz screen and to allow you to see differences between various refresh rates. Everything checked out fine and there was a noticeable difference between the 144hz line of spaceships and the 60hz line of spaceships. Regardless I kept using the monitor.

However, now if for any reason my monitor is only displaying 60 fps I notice it nearly instantly. The mouse cursor seems to just skip across the screen vs smoothly gliding and games seem choppy. 

Point is, you may or may not notice a big difference, but it's there and may just take you reverting your settings after awhile to notice. "

The report cited suggestions that employees be evaluated instead on the value they bring to their agencies, with continuous feedback between them and their supervisors.

"Every time I'm ever goaded into playing one of these nerdy card games with someone who's obsessed with it, it's just a matter of time before I'm saying ""okay so you win"". Even if I had the greatest hand/deck in existence, they'd find a way for me to lose. I swear they make these games so complicated so you can just make shit up to your friends who don't know how to play when you're desperate for a win. 

They always want to play again. I always suggest we play a new game called ""You Win"", so they can win and I don't have to sit through a bunch of confusing bullshit before they shove it in my face.


Edit: Not actually being serious about this. I don't really say that lol. I'm not a dick about it, I just get frustrated because these games bewilder me. I just suck at card games and I'm horrible with picking up something as simple as 'go-fish'. Some of these card games are so complicated there's simply no chance I'll learn it in one night. And little chance I'll even remember much to go off of the next time.

Ok, here is what is important, at least in my view on organizational skills.

For documents, does your company have a ticketing solution?  If so, see if there is a place within it to keep documents and solutions available for your future reference. 

Schedules -- this is important.  You'll need to coordinate your time on things you'll have to do such as backups, server updates, SCCM, WSUS, software deployment, any task you get -- I feel is important to keep it scheduled on a calendar.  For myself it's Outlook Calendar but OneNote is also good to keep tasks you need to do and notes you have on what you have done so it keeps a paper trail of what you have.  Create a change log for your servers.  This is important -- the change log is there so you can document anything you have done to the server.

Project plan -- that will help guide you when your boss give you a project to implement especially for software deployment.  All that entails is an excel doc to jot down the tasks you need to complete -- a project plan is very important to have.  

Change Control -- these are meetings and documentation reviews with your team.  Set these up so you can explain to your team the changes you'll be making to your systems. Don't do things without documenting because if a change is made, no one will know what was done.  Keep a paper trail of your work.  It's best practice."

Twitter, snapchat, instagram, twitch, kik, tumblr, youtube, hell even Minecraft accounts are all sold on the OG market.

So many people by Glocks just because they're Glocks. Nevermind the fact that most of us don't need a gun that will run with mud all over it (although many others will). They ignore the fact that it has terrible ergonomics and a shit stock trigger. Two if *the* most important factors in buying a pistol

Originally, we were supposed to play 12 this year at the Coliseum, and then the next two seasons, 20 games each. Now, we are playing 21 games at the Coliseum with this change, which means its were we are now playing a majority of games for the year.

"Exactly. Brady was barely on the field in the first half. 

1. Patterson Fumbled, Bears scored.

2. Bears kickoff, 2 plays later Patriots fumble the ball away because Sony Michel was in so much pain.

3. Bears drive and score

4. Bears kick off, and Patterson takes it for a TD.

5. Patriots kick off and play defense.

Later in the game, Bears had their punt blocked and taken for a TD.

So basically Brady had 4 offensive drives thrown out the window because of special teams and fumbles."

"I could be wrong but I believe she would have been meeting with the whole committee. So basically 50/50 conservatives and democrats. The same people that Kavanaugh had to meet with several times. Like when he met with Pelosi on (I think) aug 23, and Pelosi knew about the accusation, had the letter, and had told Ford to get the lawyers she got. (Pelosi and the lawyers know each other). She had this private meeting with Kavanaugh but never revealed any of this to him. 

I think they both deserved to be treated fairly and that could also have skewed my opinions though I hope it didn‚Äôt. 

So I don‚Äôt know if she would‚Äôve been 1 on 1 with each of them but I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôm almost certain her lawyers would have been present as well. And the reason they were doing it to keep her name anonymous is Pelosi and she said the reason she sent the letter in, and the reason Pelosi sat on it for 2 months and didn‚Äôt tell anyone is because she wanted to remain anonymous. So the republicans would try to keep it anonymous (as they usually do these investigations) and that way the other witnesses will be more honest and will want to testify. If they know they‚Äôll get dragged through the mud like all of the witnesses just did, then a lot will say ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù. So keeping them anonymous gets better information. "

"Watching your video an idea popped up;

Your problem consists of increasing range on electric cars and your proposed solution is static charging mechanism that the cars must go through. 

What about on board charging mechanism like a small wind turbine on the car somewhere? (Or 2 or 3 or 10...) When a car is on the highway it goes at least 100 km/h, which means 100 km/h wind, constantly. I'm sure someone, who knows how, could design a miniature wind turbine to stick it in aerodynamically efficient places and feed them directly into the battery. What do you think?"

"The president has the ability to demonstrate his condemnation with action. His actions have defended the murderer at every opportunity. This self proclaimed master of the deal never even tried to use this to renegotiate the deal in the light of this killing of an American resident with American citizens in his family.

The president has condoned violence against reporters in the past. He has hoped these news outlets would fail. He has gone out of his way to attack their reputation.

We have been making excuses for trump's behavior constantly. We are a boiling frog, nothing about this president's behavior is normal and saying he didn't explicitly call for one thing or another disregards his many other crimes and lies. No other political figure could create birtherism like trump did and not be forced to resign. Trump not calling for one of these bombs is not enough to exonerate him, he made his desires clear."

While I think terminally ill patients certainly have the right to die, cases of depression are another story, although I think there should be some wiggle room because some people might be depressed their entire lives and it's pointless to make them go through it.

"My general advice for shaving anywhere is to shave in a hot shower.  Pre-shave, the hot water softens the hair and skin which reduces cuts and scrapes. Post-shave, the hot water flushes the pores better, and draws blood to the surface which aids in healing.

As others have said, over time those ""pimples"" will go away. It's basically your skin reacting to shaving an area you never did before."
"Just to play Devil's Advocate. (Bear with me. I'm going somewhere with this) I'm going to assume that everything you stated is accurate and correct.

That night, three intoxicated people consented to sexual activity.

Why do you think that her intoxication invalidates her consent, but their intoxication doesn't? 

What if the other female in the situation decides that your girlfriend took advantage of her? Presuming she was just as intoxicated, would she not have a case that your girlfriend came to her house, plied her with alcohol, then took advantage of her weakened state?

Can you now see how the police might not view the situation as cut-and-dried as you do?

Regret does not equal rape in a court of law. (Maybe it does on a college campus as a Title 9 violation. Maybe it does in the court of public opinion. But not in the justice system.) 

She got drunk and did something that she wouldn't have done while sober. That doesn't mean that the other person is culpable for her choice to drink or her choice to have sexual relations while drunk.

Now if she were unconscious-limp-totally-out-drunk, that's a different story. Even if she brought the booze, drank and passed out, there's no excuse to mount an unconscious body.

Supposedly, there's video and that will tell the story. If she's an enthusiastic participant who's tipsy, that's one thing. If she's just lying there mumbling 'whatever' that's another.

Have your girlfriend get a copy of the tape. (Saying, ""I want a keepsake of the evening"" will be a better tactic than being confrontational.) If it shows that she was a rag doll and practically unresponsive, then she's got a definite case to take to the police for prosecution - regardless of whether she brought the alcohol or not. The rape is the greater crime.

And, if that's the case, she should absolutely do just that. Unmercifully push for prosecution.

If there is no tape, then it's 'she said, they said,' and there's no way to move forward from a legal perspective.

If there is a tape showing her alert and having a good-ol-time, then they're no more guilty of rape than she is of raping them.

From a legal perspective.

I do wish that situations of sexual assault were clearer. I really do because I understand very well the consequences when they're not. But there's a huge gray area that the law's trying to navigate. Sometimes it doesn't do so very well, but it's the best we got at the moment.

In her situation, she has the blessed opportunity to get hold of a tape and actually see the situation clearly for herself. To know the truth. That's more than most in her position.

If you can't notice it that after you score (sometimes you don't even need to score for this to happen) your players are getting nerfed (taking extra unnecessary touches, playing bad passes, not positioning themselves like they did before) and everything your opponent does is a scoring chance, every clearance goes back to his players, every pass you intercept rebounds back to them, every shot rebounds back to them even though they were unable to create a single chance before then you are just blind or too dumb to realise it that this game is rigged, simple as.

Edit: Just want to add I realise it when the game favors me as well, I scored some shitty goals against a better opponent many times, where everything just rebounded to my players until I scored a goal, there was nothing the guy can do. You can just sense it when the game wants you to score. (if you can't realise it there is something wrong with you, its so obvious.)"

"Not sure if this belongs here but, here goes:

About a year ago, by best friend had a massive crush on this girl. He talked to me about everything in his life. I was his outlet, the person he could talk and talk and talk to. She kind of knew that he had a crush on her, but she didn't know how big of a deal she was to him. He drafted a letter to her saying how much he loved her, and he showed it to me so I could give some advice. I was honest and said it was really meaningful and well-written and that he should give it to her. All of his other friends disagreed, but he went through with the plan. Long story short, it nearly ended their friendship. He was devastated, and his brain went into overtime to force himself to have a crush on another girl. 355 days later, he still calls that day the worst day of his life, and it probably wouldn't happen if I hadn't told him to give it to her."

&gt;You don't need evidence they actively engaged in combat 


Yeah, you do. If you cant, there are other charges but association isn't a crime. You have to prove they aided an illegal act. That's why people are convicted with conspiracy or plotting. There has to be evidence that they were actively doing something negative.

And that's unlikely. So by all means, if they do incriminate themselves in something more than words to the media that can be walked back, then we'd use it."

"My first question I'd ask is why Consul? Have you looked at the built-in ECS service discovery? It's come a long way and is quite good. Consul requires additional things on top of ECS, namely Registrator, to function. While Registrator works, it's not actively developed / maintained, which could create some weird dependency issues down the road. As far as a K/V store goes, SSM is really great and gives you history and granular access control, both of which are harder to get in Consul. You also lose the amazing integration that ALBs have with ECS services by using Consul + a proxy like Traefik or Nginx.

For what it's worth we use Consul + Registrator + Traefik in ECS. It's fine, but had these other things existed when we built the infrastructure, we probably wouldn't have this component and be happier without it."

"&gt; It will always be an ancient record brought to light by a prophet of God.

Except we have apologists now who are conceding that it is a modern production, inspired by God. I think ""always"" is too strong a word here.

&gt; That's what the spirit is for. :)

Then how are we to distinguish between spiritual testimonies that conflict with the testimonies of others? I feel the spirit strongly testify that Brigham Young was a false prophet. This is the same spirit, felt the same way and more strongly and clear besides, that testified to me of everything I ever had a testimony of while I still believed in Mormonism. Perhaps you have never had a confirmed testimony of that particular aspect of the church, but assuming you have, how can our spiritual impressions differ so much? How can we distinguish between the early saints who felt prompted by the spirit, like me, that Brigham Young was a false prophet, and those who felt prompted by the spirit, like you, that he was a true prophet? On what basis can we call the testimony of the Strangites or the people who left the church because of Hiram Page erroneous when we base our own beliefs and opinions on a spiritual impression that both they and we claim to have received the same way? How so especially when at some time in the past, both groups had spiritual impressions that converged on the same truth?"

"I think the meta is pretty good right now. Like you and others have said, the best since Abyss Encounters. There‚Äôs a lot of play, and Glad beasts are a good indicator that the meta is slowing down. I‚Äôm hoping for Akiza‚Äôs ace in the next BOX before KC Cup; a card that splashable and powerful would most certainly see play once the deck restrictions are removed, and as a result could put us into a meta where everyone has to be even more careful about the plays they make instead of ‚Äúput out 3 3000 beaters and hope I win.‚Äù

As a warning for those who check DLM, the tier lists can be slightly misleading. We‚Äôve almost never had more than 5-6 decks on there at any time, and we focus too much on those. We forget that the dozen or so decks below tier 3 are also KoG viable, even at the beginning of the season. You just gotta play your cards right.

"Definitely do the earlier waves with your DPS (I use H!Edward). You will clear the waves faster which means less time for your AI to get smacked.

This seemed to be the biggest tip I've gotten and it helped me a lot.

Otherwise the only thing I notice I'm doing is I always take a friend helper for the 3 uses of a skill (personally i prefer H!Elly friend for burning the boss down). And usually I will use 1 skill on wave 3 to try and clear the mini-boss mob quicker (since the skill is back up for pumpkinking). 

I also get the final stage with about 1:20 left on the clock so you should be okay. Just remember to use your iframes to protect both yourself and your AI as much as possible. Also I use force strikes as often as I can once the boss is angry because supposedly it depletes the gauge faster (i have not tested this to confirm for myself). 

Hope this helps, and let me know if you have any questions! :) "

"Trump has strong business ties to Saudi Arabia. Members of the GOP want to profit personally from $1 billion in sales of arms to Saudi Arabia. GOP members of congress will lose millions if this murder results in the US not selling arms to Saudi Arabia.    

Trump kept defending the Saudis until it became very obvious they did the murder, because Trump cared more about the deals and profits than a foreign government killing a US resident.  

Some people in the US government (in Congress), many US allies, and individuals in the US care very much about this. Trump and his colleagues have acted like they don't care at all that he was murdered, and keep saying how friendship (read arms sales) with the Saudis is important."

"Mod the whole game with Goblins!

Weald becomes the Goblin Forest/Cave. First few rooms represent the forest while the last few rooms represent the caves of the Goblin Nest.

As you said Bandit types are taken over by Goblins, along with most enemy types being variations. The Forest/Cave includes Wolves, wolf riders, and lesser shaman.

The Bosses would be the Greater Shaman (Hag), and the Goblin War-Party (Brigand Pounder) this would be represented by the Goblin arcane archer that Goblin Slayer encountered in the Year One comic who could fire lightning arrows, and his minions buying him time to cast his spells.


Ruins stays as the Ruins more or less. Bosses are now Goblin Champion (Prophet) and Necromancer (Ogre).

Cove becomes Sewers, and Aquaducts beneath Water Town (or City...I forget). Bosses are now Beholder (Siren), and Goblin Pirates (Drowned Crew). Pirate Crew will also have the Albino Croc in it...but since it's suppose to be friendly (I guess?), it'll be more like a mechanic to do proper damage to the Goblin Pirates.

Warrens become Battlefield, instead of pigs running around a meat factory (I never understood what the Warrens represented?), the backgrounds are the battlefield around the Farm. Bosses are now Goblin Lord (Swine Prince), and Goblin Paladin (Flesh).

Boss mechanics stay roughly the same, but animations are changed completely. Goblin Paladin is more about his followers sacrificing themselves for him instead of a regenerating abomination. Goblin Champion's fight is based around the idea that he is destroying the room with his attacks, so rubble is falling like the Prophet fight.

This is just a dream, I wish I was good at modding to do this stuff."

"&gt; Forcing other people to adhere to arbitrary rules is pretty much the definition of oppression.

Which is what these CoCs are doing.

&gt;  It only becomes a problem when they try to discriminate against others based on those rules.

And what Eich was in favor of is only discrimination based on the definitions you chose.  He did not see it as discrimination.  The way they saw it, marriage was a man and a woman by definition.  They declared that a gay man can get married, as long as he's marrying a woman.  Therefore, not discrimination.  Personally, I think that's silly, but the logic is sound and I can see where they are coming from.  The way to fight back against it is not to get them fired from their jobs, but to show them that two dudes getting married has no effect on their lives.  That it won't be a bad thing.  That the principles of adult, informed consent will still apply, so they don't need to fear the slippery slope into nonsense.   If you actually talked to them, you'd find out that the real cornerstone of this was that they have this really weird relationship with the word ""marriage"".  It's like a holy word.   I don't understand it.  But by understanding that *they* believed that, I could see how to convince them that letting gay people get married wouldn't devalue their own marriages.

You need to look past your own point of view.   Try to look at the situation from someone else's perspective.  Instead of shouting them down and dismissing them as a deplorable bigot, try and figure out why they're saying what they're saying.  

&gt; The fact that religious people like to think that their rules should apply to OTHERS is the hight of privilege most arrogant.

You mean like the people pushing these CoCs that believe I must adhere to their worldview or be censured?

&gt; Please explain how I intimidated you. That's just a silly claim.

James Damore was fired for wrongthink.  You don't think that has a chilling effect on free speech?  Firing him was designed to intimidate him and any others like him into silence for fear of losing their jobs.   We have situations with these CoCs like this one: https://archive.is/dgilk   We have donglegate, opalgate, and more.  These are all designed to silence through intimidation."

"My world evolved from my fantasies about being a spartan from Halo. Eventually I learned of the modern militia movement and thought that was the coolest thing ever. In high school, I wanted to be a cop, so my experience with law enforcement has a really big influence on my world. Fresh out of high school, I dropped the grandiosity of my world and realized that 1)most ppl think militias are fat guys playing army/impersonating police, 2) the scope of a modern military invasion is terrifying, and 3) the militia would have to fight an aggressive invasion one tiny cut at a time.

These realizations and my education in college got me to reimagine the militia as a new type of charity (not unlike hero agencies in My Hero Academia). They also made the conflict between the militia and the invading Chinese more interesting and drawn out. In planning for the books, I realized that the militia needed a serious edge. I got the idea for them to retake a captured Area 51, where they meet their first extraterrestrial being.

In college, I also began to study philosophy. I use the events and characters of my main story arc (which follows the leaders of the Arkosian Militia) to make observations and run tests on the nature of power, political ethics, war, and plenty of other philosophical topics. 

As someone who loves guns, I also like to include real-world tactics and martial arts. Someday, I hope to take it to the digital world and make it a game."

Even after that the only reason he is even giving me an interview slot is because he knows my mom. I am freaking out how did you even manage to get a response or how does anyone at all get responses?"

I should have mentioned they were breaded and looked identical to the usual strips. I pretty much wolfed the first one down whole without much chewing as I was hungry. The second I ate slower so noticed something wrong. My kids are 7 and didn't know the difference and had started eating before me.

It's hard to find the right meds, but you are doing the right steps.

"I'm not sure how effective any of these will be for such a deep scar but they are the proven effective methods for scars in general and maybe, at the very least, you can lessen its appearance. Essentially, though, what you want to do is stimulate your body into producing more collagen in the area.

* Silicone scar sheets and/or gel: Most gentle but takes a while and you need to be very consistent with it. It needs to be used every day for 12+ hours for several months. ScarAway is an easily accessible brand in the US.
* Glycolic acid peels (30-50%): can be done by a professional or at home with relative safety, as long as precautions are followed. You would do this about every 10-14 days. Makeup Artist's Choice makes peels for at home use. Their sample sizes seem pretty expensive for the 0.5 oz size but a little bit of product will go a long way, most especially if you're just using it on that tiny scar.
* Dermarolling or laser treatment: highly encouraged to do with a professional. I would try the other two and only do this after the other stuff hasn't worked. If money isn't an object for you, though, I think laser would be good for this scar."

I left it another couple days and said I'd give him the skin deposit he'd asked for on his site. I won the ""random"" gamble but apparently I needed to win twice to claim my rewards. Funny thing I had just bet the skin he gave me.

"In 1864, Nevada was trying to become a state in a hurry. This was because Nevadans wanted to guarantee more electoral votes for Lincoln's reelection. But it took a while to get a convention organized and a constitution written, owing to the problems of communicating and traveling in that era. In fact, they finished drafting the constitution with only 10 days to spare. They needed to get it to Congress (in Washington, DC) and get them to approve it, all in less than two weeks, and at the time it took 4 days just to make that trip by train. (And even trains weren't particularly reliable.)

So the Nevada convention had Western Union telegraph the whole 16,000-word constitution to DC. It took two full days for the operator to tap it out in Morse code, and WU charged by the letter, so it cost the equivalent of $64,000 in today's dollars. 

But dammit, Nevada came through. "

"They seems to do it for 2 different but strangely opposite reasons.

1) Lost of power. End game gearing in WoW has gear that directly change your talents, passives and the way your abilities behave in significant ways. The new level capped 120 gear doesn't seem to measure up to the old 110 gear, despite obviously higher primary stats.

2) Too much power. Raids in WoW have too many people and the the players have too many options to circumvent mechanics. People who think this way, find FFXIV's 3 things happening at once / collective punishment mechanics to be appealing.   
There's also in game politics/lore reasons, but personally I think that people getting upset over this is something that is expected from a game that celebrates its player division.

&gt; Blur is an alternative rock band which formed in Colchester, England in 1989. The band consists of Damon Albarn (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Graham Coxon (guitar, vocals), Alex James (bass) and Dave Rowntree (drums). Blur's debut album Leisure (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and Shoegazing and spawned their first UK Top 10 single, There's No Other Way. Following a stylistic change in 1992 (influenced by English guitar groups such as The Kinks, The Beatles, The Animals and XTC) Blur released ""Popscene"" as a stand alone single, this was a commercial flop, but was widely considered to be a crucial turning point for the band's style. Following this, Blur released 3 studio albums in a similar style: Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). As a result, the band helped to popularise the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a famous chart battle with rival band Oasis dubbed ""The Battle of Britpop"". 

&gt; By the late 1990s, with the release of Blur (1997), the band underwent another reinvention, influenced by the lo-fi style of American indie rock bands such as Pavement; in the process, Blur finally gained mainstream success in the US with the single, ""Song 2"". The last album featuring the band's original lineup, 13 (1999) found Blur experimenting with electronic music and gospel music, as Albarn wrote more personal lyrics. In May 2002, Coxon left Blur during the recording of their seventh album Think Tank (2003). Containing electronic sounds and simpler guitar playing, the album was marked by Albarn's growing interest in hip-hop and African music. 

&gt; In December 2008, Blur announced that they would be reforming for the first time since their hiatus in 2003, complete with Graham Coxon, for a UK Tour in 2009. Blur headlined the Oxegen Festival in Ireland, Glastonbury and the T in the Park Festival in the UK, as well as Dates in London, Manchester, Newcastle, Southend and Wolverhampton. The band continues to be sporadically active, releasing the single ""Fool's Day"" and the documentary ""No Distance Left to Run"" in 2010, and performing several concerts in 2012. Two new songs, ""Under the Westway"" and ""The Puritan"", were released in 2012 leading up to a post-Olympics concert which also features New Order, The Specials and Bombay Bicycle Club. In 2015, Blur released The Magic Whip. Read more on Last.fm.

"No. There are a lot of posts about luck here but honestly that is not necessary. Lets look at a couple examples. Regular joe like you goes to school, but just does an undergrad and manages to get into investment banking starting at 22. By his 28th birthday this how it looks for him:

140k + 150k + 250k + 250k + 400k + 420k = 1.6M

Someone else becomes a surgeon. Only start at 26 or whatever, but then makes 400k + a year. Or in some other specialized medical field

Someone could be a programmer at a FAANG company and follows a similar path as the banker, but slightly lower scaling. 

What you're missing is 2 years of promotions and scaling in a career that scales way better in the first place."

So I went to go get take out one day. I sat and waited for my food to be cooked and some guy who was on the really big side just got his order before me. He went to go get spoon fork packet of sauce etc. I got my order shortly after and i went to go get a spoon and a fork which is to the left of him. I didn't touch him or anything and he tells me you're supposed to say excuse me. It was a long day and I told him oh sorry. 

Should i have needed to say excuse me even though he took his time grabbing stuff and I didn't push or reach over him while I grabbed my spoon and fork in like 2 seconds?

"It's also worth mentioning fascia is why those correctives that you mentioned work. The muscular slings are how we harness the rotational power that propels our gait - instead of the body just moving linearly. It's also why we throw/punch/kick/swing a golf club or weapon most effectively in a twisting motion instead of a straight forward movement. 

(Just wanted to throw that out there because so many try to ""debunk"" the importance of fascia and they're not understanding we conceptually already understand that our most efficient human movements come from fascial loading of the kinetic chain via rotation/twisting.)"
"&gt; If any other country attacked their neighbor with slingshots and rocks, nobody would blink if the attacked country fought back.

I think if that country ""fought back"" with actual advanced military weapons, it would be seen as an unjustified response. People throwing rocks is wrong, but that doesn't give you a right to bomb a whole city in response. Jesus christ..."

"Yeah, I really doubt a 200-400 calorie surplus for 2 weeks will equal a 10 pound weight gain.

Plenty of websites will write that about 3500 calories is 1 pound ([which does have many flaws, and is based on the flawed assumption that 3500 calories = 1 pound of fat, but nevertheless](https://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/111114p36.shtml)). If we use this as a rough guideline, and say you were on a 400 calorie surplus every day for 2 weeks, that would be 14 * 400 = 5600 extra calories, which would be less than 2 extra pounds.

There are some problems with looking at the math like that, but there's probably more going on than just your calories being a bit high"

"I'm transitioning to a software developer role at my job, and the team I'm working with uses mostly Java and React. I majored in CS in college so I have a good knowledge of the fundamentals, and I know Java, but have never touched React or even Javascript. I got access to Pluralsight through my work, but all of the React courses there seem to require knowing some Javascript beforehand. Is it normal to learn Javascript and then React, or are there some good tutorials/courses out there for learning them together? I'm fine with learning as I go with my job but I really need to do some kind of crash course of the fundamentals if I'm going to do any front-end work."

It seemed especially unfair to Amy, who had waited for him almost her whole life, finally got to travel with him, and then got told she wasn't fit to be his companion after making a mistake she couldn't even remember.

To resolve the issue, AHTC management which is WP appointed an indpependent panel to act on behalf of AHTC as part of that solution

"\&gt; We need this why exactly? When has saying genocide is objectively wrong ever stopped a genocide?

[The End of World War II in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe).

Allied Forces fought and died to defend the objective value of human life and to end the maniacal slaughter of Jews, Africans and Gypsies, all of whom the Nazis had deemed as undesirable or of no or lesser, human value.

If all human life does not have the same intrinsic value, why should a police officer risk his life to protect yours?

Democracy is founded on the notion that [all human life is created of equal value to its creator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal).  So, when our nation rebukes despots or tyrants, saying:

""What you are doing is wrong and if you do not stop and correct the harms you've caused, we will war against you.""

Are we ""wrong"" for taking the objective stance that all human life has equal value and the right to enjoy life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and should be protected?

Or, are you saying that our perception that murdering people needlessly is wrong is simply an alternative worldview of equal value with those who think genocide is fine?  If this is so, it would seem that you are saying that genocide is acceptable and that it just so happens that our view that genocide is wrong is the only thing that make genocide ""bad""."

"Entropy does not decrease without affecting an outside system. If the cooling apparatus is completely inside your closed system it will not reduce the temperature of the water. A cooling apparatus such as a refrigerator works by taking heat from inside the system and rejecting it to the outside atmosphere. Entropy decreases inside the system in this case, but it‚Äôs not a violation of thermodynamics because it is increasing the entropy of the air in the rest of the house. Same for an air conditioner, which rejects heat to the outside atmosphere. 

In order to cool the water, you must have the exhaust of the cooler be outside of the system. And thus entropy can rise and fall without issue. "

"Kind of reminds me of Elvis Costello, but before he learned how to sing. Not meant as a slight to you, but I think you have a good base and could benefit from a vocal coach. Good luck, friend!"
"Fair enough. It's not really the same as the difference between 1 and 3, or 6 and 7. Basically, if you're the no. 5 lock, you're going to be behind the tighthead. That means you need to providing a certain amount of grunt behind him. For players who aren't used to it, it can be tiring. Henderson has looked absolutely gassed playing there in the past for example.

This sometimes leads to a situation where you have a lock who's being picked primarily for his scrumming. That means people can associate no. 4 locks with being the better lineout operators or offering more in the loose, but there's no hard and fast reason for that to be the case. A lad who can play 5 can play 4, but when you pick two lads who are predominantly 5s, you might notice things like the lineout aren't as strong. You wouldn't pick two Quinn Rouxs in your team, but equally, you might be a bit worried about scrum if you had Toner and Henderson there for 80 minutes as they could tire.

However, there's no reason why a no. 5 shouldn't be good at all those things too. It's just less common, because they can coast into a team easier on just scrum power. For example, O'Connell is the best second row I've ever seen, and he played 5. When I said Ryan can do both, what I meant was that he is brilliant in general play, while also being an extremely strong scrummager. It's why I feel he's an automatic starter. No matter who comes off the bench, he's going to be good beside them.

It's not as complicated as the back row, but a lot more goes into picking the second row than just ""who are two really good locks?"" The balance has to be right. Another factor that comes into it is height. If you have one massive lock, like Toner, it can make the scrum awkward because if the two locks' heads are in the same place but their heights are radically different, you have an awkward bind between the two, and an awkward bind for the 8 at the back."
That's cool

"Prions are notoriously difficult to destroy. I believe they've been shown to sometimes survive on equipment immersed for days in highly concentrated sodium hydroxide followed by high temperature autoclaving. I work in a lab dealing with post-mortem human brain samples, so this is of course a big concern. I wouldn't want our pipette tips and other plastics, even after autoclaving, to be reused or recycled for any other purpose. The only way to safely deal with prions is total incineration, in the process of which your plastics would also be completely destroyed."

"If it was me, I'd be putting as much towards the mortgage as possible.

This gives you the equity that you can use to leverage another house purchase in the future if you want while bringing interest payments down (significantly) in the short term.

IF there's nothing else planned for that $500k, then having it in a savings account is costing you.

Lets say you're getting 3% interest on the savings, but a fixed 12 month mortage will be 4.2%.  You're paying 1.2% interest for keeping your money in the bank.  Slap it on the mortgage.

No you won't be earning money on it, but you won't be paying as much interest.

When it comes to you looking for a owner occupied home, you can use that $500k equity (Not quite all of it, because you'll need to keep 35% equity in the investment property) to look at an owner occupied.

This will be the same whether the money is in the bank, or you use cash.

The 20% on the investment prpoerty surprises me though.  I know it can be done, but it seems strange none the less.  Banks usually require 35% on an investment property and 20% on an owner occupied.

This means you'll only be able to draw down to having 350k equity on your investment property ($200 current equity, and an additional $150k in cash), leaving you with $350k equity for a 20% owner occupied house, banks would be able to lend to nearly 1.75mil on that owner occupied if you base it on minimums and so long as you can prove income to pay both back."

At the end, my point is theoretical. I don't think that examining only the legitimizig discourses is enough to understand social process of exploitation. Processes of exploitation, those that extract, force and demand certain things out of people for socially valuable objectives,  is something thats done to your physical body, and when it's about gender, to certain bodies identified to be of a certain gender. In this sense, men are subjected to different proccesses of exploitation specifically for their gender, just like women are.

More generally I belive we should analyze and critique social institutions from a POV that centers on those proccesses, rather than merely on criticizing social ideologies (which is, by itself, fine but incomplete).

So yeah, probably a lot safer to go for the gradual shoe-braking technique than risk either of those things by leaving the bike where it was or hitting the brakes."

"Glad to help.

Just gonna give you this quick tidbit, I'd highly recommend against the Assassin prestige class. You stop getting caster levels and all your class features stop scaling.

Unless your group tends to play and design purely around flavor, you will end up being a hollow shell of what you'd be capable of compared to the Enigma or Toxitician archetypes.

The Assassin death attack is quite literally one of the biggest trap options in the game, requiring you to spend 3 rounds studying a target, then give them a  DC 10 + the assassin‚Äôs class level + the assassin‚Äôs [Int](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier save (so mid levels 8-10 thats maybe a DC 18 or 19 if you were int based).

Poison is also incredibly bad in Pathfinder, having fixed DCs and being very expensive. Unless you secrete or produce poison through a class feature (such as the Venomfist Brawler, or the Grippli poison, or Nagaji), the DCs will be laughably low without investment, when you're already trying to be a good face, have stealth, and have magic and utility. That's why I recommended the Toxitician, or I'd recommend you look for other classes that explicitely scale poison.

I'd really consider just going full Mesmerist, you'll be able to do a lot more and have more coherent class features rather than a mishmosh of non useful abilities."

That said, you have to remember your provider is a person too. They may not be great at bedside manners but may be incredibly intelligent and always do right by you. Or maybe their last patient was an asshole and they're in a bad mood, or they missed lunch, or they're short staffed and in a rush. Any number of things can make what they tell you come off the wrong way, but ultimately you need to be willing to accept it.

Obviously the ELPs are not fiduciaries, and that's a shame. Dave should be recommending professionals that will do what's in the client's best interests and not their own. "

" The SGI Teachings ""On Seeking Guidance"" Is a Form of Infantilism 

**I am amazed how many intelligent and accomplished people in SGI seek guidance from uneducated and untrained SGI leaders, particularly from top Japanese senior leaders whose only claim to knowledge and wisdom is their position in the organization.

They absolve themselves of their responsibility by resorting to a higher power or authority, a so-called SGI senior leader. Please note that this is not Buddhism.**"

"I worked in a fish store that sold aquarium fish as my first job and was already an established reef keeper back in the 90s,  I saw it all.  Just the amount of dead we saw.  We had a customer bring a heniochis (spelling?  The poor man's Moorish idol) back dead 24 hours after purchasing it along with a Tupperware container of his water and informed us it was his only fish.  Turns out he set up the tank and put about 30% more salt in there than he should have and didn't measure it,  65 gallon so that was fine I guess.    We all dared each other to put the thing in our mouthes to see if it was pickled .  The guy literally bought a hydrometer went home did a water change came back and this time we sold him 3 yellow tailed blue damsels ...(I went with those usually because they are considerably less aggressive and so not as much of an issue to keep later).

Now if it were a freshwater tank at least the fish would live long enough to potentially cycle the tank.... unless he still bought salt water fish to put in there.  I had that almost happen , had the fish bagged but the customer began asking weird questions and it turned out they had a fresh water tank and were buying a tang.    Not good.

Hell, even as far back as Re: CoM Axel is implied to be growing a heart. And Xemnas' true motivations were never to give his followers hearts. At the end of 2 he tries absorbing the power of Kingdom Hearts and it's implied he was always planning to do that. Again, especially in 2FM the additional scenes paint a very different picture.

"The best thing you can do in the very beginning is to go into games and just practice your blinks.

"&gt; How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust.

&gt;**We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was ""legal"" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was ""illegal.""** It was ""illegal"" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's Germany.

"Get the idea of hope out of your head. A passion career is based off preparation, perfecting your craft and demonstrating it. Not to mention networking too. I'd suggest taking a look at your life priorities. Do you want a family? What kind of lifestyle do you want? Could you maintain your passion despite bad management, long work hours and at times barely making ends meet if you could make your passion into a career? 

&amp;#x200B;

These are very important to consider since you may or may not have an exit strategy if you want to make your passion a side hobby or part-time gig separate from your money making career or pursuits. I have a passion for art and comics, but want a family later in life. I like numbers and tech thus am majoring in accounting with a possible double major in Information Systems. While it may not be the most extravagant career, it will allow me to basically fund my hobby which is the exciting thing about it. I may not have had the 10 - 15 plus years in art or comics to draw well, but there as sure are heck a lot of artists and composers, some starving, that could use the employment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say you wanted to make a video game or create your own videogame name. Do you want to work for someone else? Do you want to own it and assemble a team to make the best product possible? Those are also good questions. Keep in mind in your passion industry, heck, anything at all, a group or collaboration on a project with a clear defined goal will usually produce much better results in a shorter time frame than a single person doing it full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Take what I say with a grain of salt though haha. Most of this is from experience and a lot of self reflection on what I personally want out of life. Best of luck! "

I'd probably agree that this constitutes an epidemic, but it's not a *Republican* epidemic, and it's not an epidemic because there are a few of these weirdos running for office. Almost anyone can run.

Like I said in my other comment referencing the Pew data, the problem seems to be that younger people are increasingly more likely to be anti-vaxx for some reason. It's not really a partisan issue, and painting it like one isn't that helpful. At most, the story here is just ""yes, the right wing has anti-vaxxers too"", but that's actually old news."

"The one that scarred me for life was this film on proper hygiene.

Nasty teeth, leprosy.... But the one that was the most horrifying for me was this thing where a guy's skin on his feet basically rotted away to nothing, giving him these insanely long and skinny toes (which were basically bits of muscle with some scabbed flesh over the bones).

Sweet jeebus, thinking of it today gives me major shudders...

And yes, this was mid to late 70s (78ish, I'd wager).

"[Former post here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/originalxbox/comments/9ojbk1/looked_at_the_side_area_of_a_former_toys_r_us/)

So the story on this was a friend and I went to a former Toys ""R"" Us to make a video. Right at the end when we were leaving I looked in the little side entrance they had and saw this box on the ground, buried under a bunch of other stuff to be forgotten about. Many people told me I should have grabbed it so... I tried just that today! The first employee at this Toys ""R"" Us turned Halloween shop was pretty confused at my offer to purchase an old Xbox cardboard box, but I showed him and he grabbed it. He said he had no issue giving it to me, but he had to get the okay from his GM. I came back later and met the GM, who knew me as ""the Xbox guy"" and gave it to me. Her logic was the landlord was going to throw it out anyway, she had no idea it was there, and had no idea that anyone would want it, so she was happy to give it away.

Before anyone asks: this did not come with a console, controllers, cables, or any manuals/promotional material. As you can see, where the S/N info would be there's a big ""FOR DISPLAY ONLY"" note there. In every other way, this seems to be identical to the retail box, except this one was used exclusively as a promotional item. The front of the box has 2 soft velcro pieces stuck to it, and the $149.99 on there is a sticker. That at least helps to date around the time this was last used on the sales floor.

That's about all I have for you, if you have any other question about it feel free to ask. Shameless plug, but if you're interested in the video we shot, [here you go!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xr_-FjeP2c)"

"I think a lot of underhanded douche-ness is missed first season on Dan.  He's quite a likeable character in the following seasons, but if you rewatch season one after knowing its outcome - you see why Chloe is estranged from him and why Lucifer senses the shadiness from him.

Knowing he's responsible for Palmetto, I looked back at season one and saw:

* Pilot - him really digging into her confidence as a detective and suggesting her taking on a famous case might be just too much for her after her big f\* up on Palmetto
* Later in the season, when he finally does agrees to help her with Palmetto, he hides evidence.  Specifically, the key that came up clean (Favorite Son) or...
* He plays completely faithful in helping her solve it - when it's likely only to protect / cover his own ass
* Even after Malcolm kills his old cop partner, even after Malcolm kidnaps him... he STILL won't turn Malcolm over to the police
* He only admits to his involvement once completely cornered by it leading to the Lucifer/Malcom/Preacher murder situation

In the season 1 finale, Lucifer asks Dan what he really wants and it's ""redemption"".  I think the following season's he's simply trying to prove that.

If you haven't seen the 2 extra episodes after season 3, one gives a bit of insight as to Dan's shady past and/or tendencies.

"I‚Äôm sorry you felt my response was condemning but like someone else said  - what you‚Äôre describing is something my adoptive parents would have dreamed about. I was easily 100x worse with lying and behaviour than anything you‚Äôve described.  I‚Äôve also worked with teens on the criminal justice system (most of whom were in group homes and foster care) and what you are describing doesn‚Äôt even touch the surface of troubled teenage behaviour.

I spent 9 months in a lockdown residential treatment facility with a specific adoption program because my parents had no idea what else to do and they were genuinely concerned I might die every time I left the house. When I came back I didn‚Äôt speak to them for close to 6 months. 

Looking back now they were probably right though - I‚Äôve lost approx 15 friends since age 16 to drugs, drunk driving, suicide and various other reckless behaviours. 

You are describing normal teen behaviour - like normal for any kid not even an adopted one with trauma. This is part of learning who you are as a teen and finding your identity. 

Obviously as parents you have every right to be concerned but you should also probably read what everyone else is saying and realize you are over-reacting and that this behaviour isn‚Äôt even close to what I would consider to be a troubled teen. 

Edited to add: I would highly recommend that you and your SO seek therapy and support systems for adoptive parents if you are not already. One of the token moves for adopted kids (not all of course) is to say and do hurtful or illogical things/self-sabotage due to feelings of abandonment and the worthlessness that comes from it. Testing the limits of people who tell us they love us to see if they‚Äôll stick around when no one else did is also standard. I wouldn‚Äôt call the girls ungrateful - they‚Äôre literally testing you to see if you‚Äôll stick through the tough shit. 

Also, it took me years of therapy to realize this was something I did and that it‚Äôs common in adoptees. I still do it without realizing sometimes and have to work really hard to go back and correct my behaviour and actions because apparently fully trusting someone not to abandon me is never going away.

"I sometimes think about how it's possible that the world is only 500 years old. Or 2 years old. Or even just one week old. There's no way to find out.

It's possible that a God created the entire universe just one week ago. He also created all fossils, all history books, and he also ""created"" all memories you seem to have of your life. There's no way of knowing if your memories ever actually happened.

You ate pizza last week? Maybe God created the universe only 2 days ago and made you *believe* you ate pizza last week.

"   Let's say you buy a random crypto, stock, etc today, no thought put into it, and sell it in two weeks. The probability of you profiting or not, in theory, is 50/50 (it's actually not as we know bc there are other factors, but because you put no thought into it it's essentially gambling with 50/50 odds).

   TA is about finding higher probability trade setups. So you use price action, support and resistance, indicators, etc. to find these setups that instead of having 50% odds, have 60% or 70% instead.

   There are no surefire trades. Zero. Every experienced trader knows this. Even if you trade eight 70% trade setups in a row, there is still a possibility you lose every single one. But after 100, 200, 300 trades, you will have made money overall because the odds are in your favor.

   That's the difference between trading like a professional using TA, and a crypto manchild who feels he has to always be right with his calls. Professional traders know they will be wrong many times, and that is a fact of life, but they make money in the long run. Crypto manchilds follow other people's calls and get mad at them when their calls are wrong, not realizing they can always be wrong, and start trading based on emotion instead of a disciplined trading plan, leading to constant losing streaks.

   That is what TA and professional trading is all about; Putting the odds in your favor. Not the Reddit mentality here of profitting from every trade, and having a magic crystal ball that can guess where the market goes every time. That's impossible and no one is claiming that but people seem to act like it is being claimed.

"I think it's more likely that a TV series set in the Wizarding World but not a retelling of the books could happen, and I think it would be even better. My wish list includes:

 ""The Marauders"" which could be setup much like the HP series you described, with one season being one year at Hogwarts but following Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs instead of the Trio. We could see Lily and James's relationship change over time and also flesh out the arc from bully to Head Boy that James goes through. I like the idea of it delving into the First Wizarding War but from something of a distance. Early on in the series it would be kind of in the background and brewing, but the kids would be too young to really see it. As the series progresses we'd see it come to the forefront; stuff like Snape's Death Eater aspirations coming to light and students losing family and friends as Voldemort gains power and becomes bolder. Lupin's lycanthropy and Sirius's home life definitely seem like they could provide for a lot of serious and meaningful story telling.

and

""The Ministry"" (Not married to the title) A workplace comedy about the Ministry of Magic that makes fun of the insane juxtaposition of mundaneness and bureaucracy with magic. It would also be a good opportunity to see more about where the magical and non-magical worlds interact, both with things like &gt;!""The Other Minister""!&lt; and by having some of the main characters be Witches or Wizards that are married to Muggles. If this is set in the present, we could follow low level employees that make references to characters from the books that we know to have gone on to high level Ministry jobs but never (or rarely) actually see them as they are too important to be involved with the people we're following.

"I get your point too. The problem with that is..why not treat them fairly? Treating people fairly even though they haven't treated you fairly won't actually hurt you. I mean stay on your ps and qs of course to keep them from treating you unfairly but what exactly would not treating them fairly accomplish?

And yeah, i agree when it comes to people of color like that they do enjoy the fruits of other people's oppression. At the same time though that's like enjoying a rotten apple while others are starving. Sure, you're getting something to eat but it's tainted.

When it comes specifically to racist white people, ask yourself this. Why is it that white men are both in almost complete power in america while at the same time some of thee most miserable, angry, vulnerable and generally whiny people you're ever likely to meet? Not all white people of course but a certain portion.

I mean make one post about how white privilege exists and you'll have that one category fuming at the mouth to take you out. Well, that's because while other people are actually starving...the food they're eating...is rotten through an through. And they know it.

I'm not suggesting that they don't get fair consequences. No, they're fair consequences are that they feel like it's fair. Put it like this. Lets say you and another person are in a foot race. On the starting line the other person you're racing against changes the rules of the race. Stating that you have to have weights attached to you while they can run the race without any. You start the race and lose expected. Get upset without realizing how much of an impact those weights have on you. So you challenge them again and again an lose every time. You practice and practice. Getting stronger and faster each time. While they sit on their ass eating doritos and stroking their many trophies.

Then one day they get cocky. They then challenge you to a race...without you being weighted down. What happens if your body hasn't succumb to the effects of running with weights on? That's right. At that point not only do you win but you win so well and so fast they'll never be able to comfortably win while you have the weights on again.

So..again....

Why is it that white men are both in almost complete power in america while at the same time some of thee most miserable, angry, vulnerable and generally whiny people you're ever likely to meet?

Yeah, same goes for those who ignore racism/bigotry and those who help racism/bigotry. They know. It might not be surface level knowledge but...they know. Which to me is punishment enough. Hopefully you understand what i'm saying."

"Also, some guy commented about how it was unnecessary to say that I‚Äôm a girl, but he deleted his comment. I already typed all of this out, so I thought I‚Äôd share it anyway for more clarification on my decision.

 I stated that I was a girl to emphasize the double standard on the left. I didn‚Äôt say to automatically prove him wrong. Liberals always say things such as men can‚Äôt comment on issues like abortion because it doesn‚Äôt involve them. This is only true if a man is against abortion. If a man is pro choice than feminist praise him for his progressiveness. So basically liberal logic is that you can only have a valid opinion on certain issues if you‚Äôre in that exact position. So according to liberal logic my Bible teacher shouldn‚Äôt be commenting on a women‚Äôs issue, such as the pay gap, but because he agrees with liberal ideals he‚Äôs aloud to do so. But because I disagree with the idea of the wage gap, my opinion is disregarded and I‚Äôm labeled as sexist and hateful, even though I am a girl."

"The PVP option on map races is restricted to your current session. The notification is a small green circle next to your mini map which tells you to open the world map and join a pvp event. Theyve probably appeared for you plenty, but if you haven't raced against others that means you haven't join just like no one else has.

Once you clear the tutorial seasons and the true game world opens you can join team adventure playlists which is pvp matchmaking. You can also do seasonal events which will rotate every week that should also have actual players.

Overall the implementation of PvP in the game needs a fair amount of work. Unranked team adventure is the most reliable once you can access it, but many players do not like the randomized format or the freeroam aspect.

The besy way to play PvP with control over the content is to join up with friends or find a group online that will get in an online session together and plan out activities."

"Climate science is a huge area of study. Scientific studies generally have a very specific and limited scope, which can lead to contradictory predictions within the same field.

Both could be valid studies, yet have contradictory conclusions."

Also if you notice an INFJ stare.
It‚Äôs part of our cognitive process that we can hardly help. 


Something interesting to me now that I didn‚Äôt completely understand at the time 


I had a FaceTime catfish this year done to me. 

And this is when I payed no attention at all to being INFJ.

But I was on to them right away none the less I had to confirm my fears. 

I saw in the upper right hand corner myself doing the INFJ stare and all the while was aware of my process of reception and when I made up my mind that I‚Äôd figured it out and this is enough. 

Didn‚Äôt even know what an INFJ stare was. 
But after I delved into Meyers Briggs and INFJ personally I knew exactly what I was doing in that extremely off putting chat. 

I found an INFJ on you tube that was explaining his cognitive processes during the INFJ stare 
and I can confirm he‚Äôs absolutely right. 
I‚Äôll see if I can find and share it with you.

"Everybody says this, but it's flatly untrue. Gwyn's _people_ were terrible, as those who follow after a revolutionary leader often are. Gwyndolin is of course running a secret police and using the Church as a means of warping history. Gwyn himself was astoundingly progressive for a gritty fantasy king. He made a ""brutish"" giant like Gough one of his Four Knights. Ciaran looks suspiciously like a former Ringed Knight, what with having fake eyes carved into her mask and those curling horns on her head and around her joints. Gwyn gave a part of his Lord Soul to the Four Kings, who were _human sorcerers_ -- not clerics! He held the Four Kings in the same esteem as his Knight-Captain Ornstein, if not greater!

The only ""bad"" things he did were allowing Seath to run free and convincing the Pygmy Lords they didn't want to leave the Ringed City. Seath of course was his best bet at creating a perpetual Flame, and so the end justified the means. Likewise, the humans were _happy_ in the Ringed City, even if it was essentially a prison. Let's not mince words here -- humans are _monsters_ in this setting. Even though the Dark we see is always on the brink of madness instead of its natural peaceful state, it's still the raw force of _Oblivion_. Men are still kin to Locusts. Unsealed, we're a bunch of all-consuming void-monsters. Frankly, Gwyn was too kind.

Morality isn't black and white, but the power of erasure the true and peaceful Dark brings, like we see in Drangleic, is uniformly destructive and should indeed be fought against even if all the world turns to ash. Siding with the harbingers of Nothing because you're the same species is pointless factionalism. Even the hate-filled monsters of Londor eventually realized that Gwyn was right, even if they themselves are just as petty and terrible as Gwyndolin."

"What worries me is how even if you remove Trump now the damage to your society has already been done. The distrust in the media, in democratic institutions, in your fellow citizens that has been created, the misinformation and conspiracy theories that will linger for decades... 

The world needs a modern, science and ethics based US that takes an active stance more than ever to face the challenges of this century; with climate change, emerging asian superpowers that have a very different concept of society and the individual; technological advancements disempowering huge parts of the population and concentrating all wealth in the hands of the very few, endangering the democratic core of our societies that are already under constant attack by failed states like Russia and SA.

You guys have armed yourself to the teeth to the point that you can never be attacked. But that also means you can not be helped if you allow your country to slide into a dictatorship, unlike 1940s Germany. I know this sounds melodramatic, but the way this administration has shown complete disregard for the rule of law and a democratic order and gotten away with it almost without protest is really frightening."

Title: **Small claims court for property loss**

Original Post: 

&gt; A lady ran a red light and caused me to get into a car accident. Her insurance accepted 100% liability. The insurance company is trying to total my car and only give me $7,000 for compensation. The damage appraisal was for $10,988. Can I take this lady to small claims court for the remainder of the money or is it a total loss?

It had a bug when it first dropped that prevented its punchthrough perk from dealing its second tick of damage as well, leading to really underwhelming PvE damage, though from what little I've used it that seems to be fixed.

"I leveled her to 130. The load-out I'm using is Calamity/Ranger/First Shot Rio. Ranger in support for + 24% pistol damage and FSR in tactical for increased War Cry duration. 

&amp;#x200B;

When fully leveled, Calamity does 24% extra pistol damage and 48% increased impact (first six rounds only, once you shoot your seventh round she loses those buffs). She also gets debilitating shots which works wonders so long as you're mindful of how many rounds you've fired. Near as I can tell, she's built to be a mist monster/mini-boss killer. Pair her with a hard hitting pistol like the beagle, pop war cry and proceed to delete mist monsters in 1-3 shots depending on their level and elemental resistance. Each pistol kill reduces her cooldown of lefty and righty, which you should be using as soon as it procs. It deals decent damage and is great for taking out smaller husks.

&amp;#x200B;

I've only played 3 matches with her so far but I still feel that Ranger is the better-rounded pistol hero. Ranger has phase shift which is pretty much invaluable, and like someone mentioned earlier you'll need to keep reloading once you've fired six rounds to keep her damage consistent. Fast firing pistols like the viper and ratatat are out of the question, but she performs well with the beagle and whisper .45"

&gt; 
&gt; She has suicidal tendencies and i know she will kill herself. What can i do to help, i dont want her harming herself and i dont want word to get out. She told me this about 10 minutes ago and i dont know what to do. Im 15 and she is around the same age as me. What can i do about her father and the pregnancy without word getting out and her harming herself. I cant call 911 because she isnt harming herself and word will get out i really need help on what to do

I don't think so. Faith could be with or without evidence in both religious and non religious context.

&gt;If we find evidence to the contrary we ignore the results induction gives - we've found a case where it is wrong.

What you're doing is EXACTLY logical induction. If you do it the other way around: even though it was wrong in the past, it must still be right, then you're doing exactly the opposite of logical induction. There's no escape of it.

"I've built and then rebuilt my computer. I've troubleshooted issues for myself and for other pc users. I've helped other people through building their own PC.

I have the worst fucking luck on the face of the planet. I will get the dumbest fucking bullshit errors for everything I touch and it will often take hours to troubleshoot them.

One time I had an issue where my internet would disconnect once an hour at the same minute each hour for about 5 seconds (So 12:01, 1:01, 2:01, 3:01). Sometimes this would happen for just a few hours. Sometimes it would happen for days. I eventually found out that the second it disconnected would move up a bit (So 12:01:01, 1:01:03, 2:01:04, etc). If the minute it disconnected rolled over, so it reached the 59th second of that minute and then went to the next minute, the issue would stop for awhile - often weeks. My ISP could not see it on their end. My router and modem were both replaced during this time. I'm still using the same PC at my new place without this issue. So it wasn't hardware related.

I still to this day don't know what the fuck that issue was. I imagine it had something to do with the ISP, I really don't fucking know and almost nothing came up when I spent hours researching it.

Sometimes shit just sucks, man."

"This is something I‚Äôve wanted to do for a loooong time. Specifically the integration of Digimon and DnD, not a separate system. 

Never really made it past the planning stages though, aside from stating out a couple Digimon in DnD, and the basics of a ‚ÄòTamer‚Äô class, which would boost the Digimon‚Äôs raw stats, allow for temporary Digivolution and things like that.

"While impossible to know for sure how many alternate possibilities there are, knowing that they win 1 in 14 or so million is telling. In the real world we don't get together every human on the planet for surveys, but if one in 14 million people randomly selected people from around the world turned out to exhibit a particular trait, we can approximate how rare that trait is. Sure it could turn out to be 1 in 7 billion or even 1 billion in 7 billion but in a vacume that's unlikely with the provided data. So if it does turn out there are 10√ó0.56 to the 34th power realities or some other absurd crap, then the margin for error gets really damn irrelevant while the rate of the avengers winning stays the same.

But you are correct in that the ratio could be way off, it just probably isn't. (Unless I'm objectively wrong. I'm not a statistician, I'm just rationalizing.) Apparently there is a formula that can be used to find the minimum sample size for an unknown total."
"Something to keep in mind, guys... Look at the fill costs. yes. You can earn 1m in 16 hours on a cat, but you have to have 600k in the bank first. Everyones going to start with 5000 creds, and will be hauling hydrogen, and will earn about 11,500/hour. The next logical step is Agri, which is, minimum 4 hours in. Here's the thing, if you go to agri immediately, your betting your entire bank. A smart trader will run no more than 50% of his purse, and a frugal one will run 10%. But lets assume they trade hydro up to 80k, or 8 hours.   


After the switch to agri, they are now pulling 25,000/h. The next logical step is quarts. You should be at a minimum, 150,000 creds before you switch. That's another 2.5 hours to earn the difference of 70k.  


Once at quarts, you're switching to titanium next. We're going by risk/reward ratio. You are earning 30,000/h, and need to get a purse of 242,000. We'll call the difference of 100k for 250k total. That'll take 3.3 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we are at titanium, earning 44k/h. You could switch to fluorine after a run or two, but for brevity, we will wait til tungsten. We are skipping stims, because we want to stay legal. For tung, we need a purse of 420k (Heheheh). The difference is 170k. That will take you 3.8 hours to earn.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we are earning 66.8k/h. Hour next logical step is diamond. To start trading diamond we need 750k. That's  a difference of 330k. That will take almost 5 hours.   


Really, diamonds are the safe stopping point, where you will be earning almost 100k/h. Running drugs for 3x profit just seems too risky. But now, you've climbed the trade ladder, assuming you didn't crash, in 22.6 hours. That number is static, no matter which ship you fly. I think that's a good number. What I don't like how far 1 death can set you back. 10-1 or 20-1 is long odds. I would like to see something closer to 7-1 or 15-1."

"This will be my last reply you're clearly just a misinformed fanboy. The number of times I've seen the excuse a siege team went from Xbox to PC and was good! That team was a PC team that went to console for an easy win then returned to PC. To add on to this little one though; siege barely even relies on aim (eg. it's all about tactics and positioning) so that point is pretty pointless even though you were wrong. The better game to use here would be CSGO but you would never because it died on console because console players couldn't do shit on it. Hell, even a terrible game like fortnite that's casual as all hell console players can't even hand with PC the only way they come close is by putting them in unbalanced tournaments where the goal is to get the most frags in a solo game, but they put the console player into an easy console lobby. I can't wait for that shitty excuse to die out, just like the shitty excuse of I suck at games so everyone better than me is a hacker.

"&gt; The Divide part is splitting people up by immutable characteristics and legitimizing those as vectors to critizice and judge people on. Left wing Identity politics is pretty rampant imo (don't bring up the right I know and they are of no concern for right now).

Edit: I didn't acknowledge this point but I think it is wrong too. The left does not split people up by immutable characteristics, it acknowledges that a wide variety of factors (historical, sociological, etc.) have resulted in forms of oppression specific to the world we find ourselves in. They are contingent on the institutions, ideologies, etc. that preceded them. This is about as far from immutable as you can get. These things aren't fancy philosophical ideas that exist outside of space and time, they are specific to our world as it exists today, as a consequence of what has come before it and they are rooted in the real experiences people have. And most importantly (something you conveniently ignore), we think that things can change. That's the whole fucking point. We don't want to criticize and judge people who disagree with us for eternity, we want to transform the world in such a way as to do away with the conditions that cause oppression to emerge in the first place.

&gt; On the surface they seek equality yet the would they would reject an egalitarian approach. Why does the CoC have the bucket list of characteristics? Unless ""everyone"" for some odd reason doesn't include people of color all of the sudden. Everyone is to be afforded the same opportunity and courtesy regardless of characteristics (immutable or otherwise) not withstanding ability to code. Ask yourself why isn't it somehing along those lines? Because they don't want equality they want ""representation"" and they don't want merit. Why? Because they want to in regardless of skill.

This is simply untrue. The reason code of conducts such as the Contributor Covenant CoC mention particular forms of discrimination is because open source communities are not isolated from the rest of society and are therefore subject to the same biases and institutions (that arose due to a specific set of causes and conditions) responsible for specific forms of discrimination such as that based on gender or race. They don't use vague language like ""everyone"" because the world we live in necessitates that we acknowledge forms of oppression specific to the circumstances we find ourselves in, as opposed to using vague universal language that does not acknowledge forms of oppression that actually exist. It's all well and good to suggest that everyone is equal, but realizing that intention requires doing away with the forms of oppression that are expressed in our societies.

With regard to doing away with ""merit"", I would argue that again this is a misrepresentation of what the code of conduct actually says. The only line I could find in the CoC mentioning merit is that saying that the community ought to be free from harassment of anyone, including on the basis of level of experience. This does not imply that one's abilities are no longer relevant, but rather that those who are new to the community or still learning should be welcomed and treated with respect. If you actually read the whole code of conduct, you would see that it requires accepting constructive criticism gracefully. On what basis would criticism be considered constructive in the first place if not on the quality of code? The point is to not resort to personal attacks when criticizing the work of others, and to help them improve instead of serving as a gatekeeper.

&gt; What you misunderstood is that Infiltration does not mean they come from outside. It means that they are highly motivated activists that ""Infiltrate"" into positions of power. Unearned yet given to them because they scream loudest.

Again, I would like to see evidence for this. For example, if we are speaking of the radical left, (i.e., the anti-capitalist or socialist left), this notion completely falls apart as the point for such groups is to do away with such positions of power in the first place, not to be represented among them. 

&gt;  The far left will decry racism in any field that has under representation of minorities and/or percieved underprivileged groups. However assuming a level playing field one would expect differences in Interests and thus varying percentages across different Fields. There are biological differences between the sexes which can in part explain imbalances. Access to education is also a big factor to consider. This may not cover all of it but a difference in outcome does not logically imply discrimination in the input.

First, I would point out again that if we are speaking of the radical left, this is a blatant misrepresentation of our views. The point is not to arbitrarily place people in positions of power on the basis of some form of discrimination, but rather to do away the the institutions and conditions that cause such discrimination to arise in the first place. 

Additionally, biological differences are woefully inadequate at describing differences in participation in various fields of work. One must consider the fact that we are assigned a gender at birth and from that point forward expected to act according to the gender roles that correspond to our assigned gender. From a very young age, we are taught that certain qualities, skills, and interests are inappropriate for someone of our assigned gender, and are guided into interests that correspond to societal expectations. This does not mean that individuals cannot act against or in spite of this societal pressure, but it does suggest we ought to take into account a social explanation for why there are such stark gender differences in various fields of work.

&gt;  How do they want to fix underrepresentation? Simple just hire more X in favor of Y regardless of merit. The company/project should ""represent"" the entire population after all. 51% of humans are women and so should be our parliament, management team, community.

Actually, we are quite critical of this strategy. There are some liberal groups who push for greater representation in positions of power on the basis of experienced discrimination, but that radical left broadly speaking (as I've already said) is more concerned with doing away with these sorts of institutions altogether rather than seeking greater representation within them. The strategy you described is woefully inadequate and is not representative of the views of a large swath of the left. 

&gt; So what is next: ""only XX% of accepted commits are by Y. Accept my shitty code because I wasn't loved as a child and feel victimized."" 

This only follows from your misrepresentation of the strategies of the left. We don't want you to accept our shitty code on the basis of experienced discrimination, we want to do away with discrimination so that those who currently face discrimination can better participate in the community in question. That doesn't imply that projects have to accept shitty code because of the person who wrote it. Remember, the code of conduct adopted by the Linux kernel specifically states that we have an obligation to accept constructive criticism gracefully. 

&gt; Which puts us in step 3: Regulate. Exert control through Ideological dominance, shaming and authority.

Once again, this only follows from your misrepresentation of the strategies of the left. "

"Apologies if I sounded mad.  I am used to high-impact discussions, and sometimes I forget that puts people off.  But I'm a huge promoter of character acting, so when I get into a CYOA, I get really into it.  That's why it ticks me off when there's discrepancies in the internal logic.

&amp;#x200B;

* Those are a few ways to go about it.  But that seems a tad over-reductive to me, since you'll have to deal with the gangs no matter what course you take.  I think I mentioned it in my original post (maybe not explicitly, and I apologize if so), but the multiple brothel picks are a mechanism to convey the fact that my method for getting out is to amass wealth and power through info trading and the pleasure business.  And I agree with you that much of it doesn't make sense, which is why I was irritated.

1. That doesn't seem to be the way it works, but maybe it's just poorly worded.  I took it to mean that you got one dose and had to acquire more.
2. Point buy system and pure choice systems have different focus at which they excel.  Point buy works better for when you want more nuances/tiers or a larger selection of options, such as the Eternal Arms or the Half Dragon CYOAs.  Pure choice models work better for simpler CYOAs or more open-to-interpretation options, such as the Flower Choice or the Magic Focus CYOAs.  It's not a requirement, but it's very helpful to everyone involved if you pick the right format for the right CYOA.  Since this one is (I think) pretty clearly in the second category, pure choice would have been a better one.
3. If that's what the CYOA intends, then the intro needs to be more specific; the way it's currently set up it's equally valid to pick ""Here's what I have right at this moment"" as it is to say ""Here's what I will end with and here's how I'll get it."""

On top of that, he parrots CNN's shoddy understanding of the false accusations statistics (it's 2-10% of INVESTIGATED/prosecuted rapes turn out to be false-- by the way, that number dwarfs almost all other crimes, and only robbery comes close-- not of all accusations) to put himself on shaky ground to begin with.

"&gt; I dont know why its so hard for canadians outside Quebec to accept the fact that this is not a xenophoby issue

The ""xenophoby issue"" is just a red herring; it's part of the Canadian narrative to discredit Qu√©bec by claiming we are ""racist"" because we want immigrants to integrate to Qu√©bec by, say, forcing them to speak French, whereas Canada would rather have them speak English so we would be minorized further more, to the point of extinction (this policy has been setup in 1840 following the Durham report). 

It's ""very hard"" because, for the Anglos, religion is a way to control people and exploit them; it is just a tool for the more powerful and wealthy to assert their power, so they cannot understand why we would want to prevent rich people to manipulate others, because the very basis of their bourgeois civilization is to take advantage of other people.

By outlawing religious symbols, and thus reducing the influence of religion, you just make it harder for some people to control others and exploit them."

"You can put rules on it. Any that YOU want, because you guys are equitable partners in this relationship. If you can't come to an agreement and follow the rules then you part ways (most likely, usually once one partner wants to open it up they REALLY want to open it up). Figure out STD/condom usage, contact boundaries. Are they just fucking them occasionally or are they dating/texting them constantly too etc. Do you get a veto on who they hook up with, do they have to do it at the other persons place etc etc. To your other point part of our exclusivity in the start of the relationship was ALL old flames, hookups etc were out the door. You can't even imagine how many old flames popped up when they thought she was suddenly single. Even months into dating she was getting random ""wan make sum fuk bby"" texts from random dudes she went to school with. If you wanna build a life with me its time to take out the trash. There is no opportunity to ""be inappropriate"" because there is no contact. Any contact is akin to cheating. There is also a high chance she was cheating and wants to open it up to avoid the mess like you said. My fiancee was having an affair with her boss (a woman) when she also asked to open it up and ""uh, maybe have a threesome"". I was fine with it, except it could be anyone BUT the boss now because you did it in a shifty fucking way. She even switched her number and job to avoid that person once things got a little ""stalkery"".










Anyway. You can also put a ratio thing on it. She is likely to get 10x more guys to hook up with than you will with girls. Maybe she can only become active with someone else once you have a someone too idk. Its hard to measure these things because so many people flake out. You will get accused of cheating ALL the time. The first 2 days I was on tinder my fiancee got a Google voice number texting and calling to let her know I was cheating sigh. its easier for our situation because she doesn't really want to hook up with guys, but with girls so we can kinda put a threesome rule on it. Or at the very least she has asked that she can watch or we take pics vids for her later to get off to. But that's still hard. We've been open for about 6 months and we've only found 1 girl willing to actually fuck me and it just happened to be another girl in a similar situation and she wanted to help us out for my birthday."

Made from PVC pipe, contains a timer (likely a digital alarm clock) to set off the detonator, powder contained in bombs comes from pyrotechnics (fireworks), xrays show probable shrapnel (AP now reporting shards of glass).

All are manila envelopes with bubble-wrap interior bearing six stamps and the return address of Florida Rep. Schultz.

"Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"This guy‚Äôs right. Assuming that OP has no control over when or where an event is and only controls ticket price, he should set the price to maximize revenue. As prices go up, sales go down. This is first day Econ 101 everywhere. That means that there is a sweetspot price that maximizes revenue. Goods aren‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt be priced based on their cost to produce. 

Assume there are two seats and the show costs $1000 to put on. So to break even and make some profit, set the price to $600. But what if we did (really simplified) market research? Maybe there‚Äôs a guy that would spend $1million on a ticket. Then price the tickets at $1million, sell one and make $999,900 profit. Maybe no one in town would pay more than $100. Then price to $100, sell both and make a loss of $800 which is better than the loss of $1000 you‚Äôd make if you priced based on cost.

"None of these examples are any different than the general thievery that goes on in the play store as well.

The one even shows links to Aptoides zendesk instance for reporting DMCA violations. And it sounds like aptoide tries to notify people when it thinks someone has pirated something to their store.

Now, there's an argument to be made that perhaps they're a little too lax in what they allow to upload. But if they respond to DMCA requests, what more can they do? It's a reasonably new store. I remember the early Android Market. It was kind of a shit show as well."

well it turns out he took $50 from at least two other people that night, with no intention of paying anyone back. he also apparently has unpaid loans from at least 3 other accounts. i felt so stupid that i let my kindness and generosity get taken advantage of, but i‚Äôve learned my lesson now!"

"You're a saint if you're still reading this thread but I haven't seen this point of view so wanted to mention it.

It sounds like you and your partner have different priorities on an anniversary. Neither of them seem innately ""right"", to me, and negotiating these things skillfully is part of a successful relationship. It also sounds like your partner has been in an abusive relationship (and I hope he's getting therapy), which means you're negotiating on Hard Mode.

Don't take me as putting the blame on you, here, because I feel your partner's reaction was also unskilful, but I think there are a few things that I think you could have done more skillfully:

I imagine you've known about RDR's release date for a while, and you've known about your anniversary date for a year. :) Asking with about 48 hour's notice doesn't seem to have been necessary. Abusive people love to make ""either you do as you say or you have to deal with my abusive reactions"" demands with as little notice as possible, because the harder the choice is, the more control they demonstrate over their partner. Inadvertently, you've made this request seem more high-stakes than it needed to be.

Secondly, I don't know if you realize it, but by not talking about your feelings about him bringing the console last vacation, you've allowed him to form a reasonable assumption that this was a rule for vacations for you two. Abusive people, again, love to change/lie about what ""the rules"" are, because the more they do so, the more they demonstrate they control the consensus reality of the couple.

Lastly, it sounds like you made a request for an outcome (""please don't play video games"") that wasn't exactly what you were after (I saw your comment about getting a ""burner"" TV so you could both play, which I really commend you for. Especially as you've already ""won"" the argument, I think it's really admirable to try to figure out how to make you both happy). Maybe a more skillful process would have been to go to your partner with your concerns (only one TV, don't want to feel separated during an emotionally significant time for you) and discuss as a couple what you could do to resolve them, having asked for his concerns too? This is a really strong signal that you regard him as an equal partner, which an abusive person will never do.

It's absolutely not your responsibility to change your behaviour to suit him - like I say, I hope he's in therapy working through these things - but given that both you and he have been hurt by this negotiation, it seems like the kind of thing you'd both like to avoid in the future. I see signs in your post that you're trying to act skillfully already (taking space during an argument, trying to to resolve this bone of contention), but supporting an abuse survivor can be very tough and non-intuitive - it took me a long time of introspection after one to lock down and start dismantling my triggers, and even longer to pull down the boundaries I'd put up to prevent it happening again, and if you're not a survivor I think it would be unreasonable for you to piece together how to work through his issues.

If you're still seething it's totally appropriate to ask him to do the emotional labour of making you content again. If you do decide to talk to him about it (which I encourage), can I suggest that the line you use is to ask him what he heard you say, and how he felt, and then to ask him what he thought you heard, and how he think you felt? (Or just tell him, if you feel like it.) Both of these positions are ""true"" for each of you, so the focus isn't to say ""ah, you heard me wrong"", but rather to empathize with the feelings that the other one must have felt having heard these things. I think you might both be surprised by how much of the bad feeling was not to do with fundamental difference of priorities, but by boring old miscommunication.

Enjoy your anniversary and good luck with RDR2!"

"Trump should call for the end of his own violent rhetoric first.   

&gt;The series of explosive devices was aimed at former president Barack Obama, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, former attorney general Eric Holder (then rerouted to congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz) and former CIA director John Brennan (via CNN). This followed a similar attempted atrocity on Monday against billionaire philanthropist, Democratic donor and Holocaust survivor George Soros.

&gt;As detectives get to work, the connections are impossible to ignore. All are individuals that the president of the United States and his allies in the rightwing fever swamps like to demonise, denigrate and deride, and put at the centre of wild conspiracy theories.

&gt;Trump has been stirring a toxic brew of anger, hostility, insults, menace and threats since launching his election campaign in June 2015. At campaign rallies he encouraged physical attacks on protesters and chants of ‚ÄúLock her up!‚Äù against Clinton.

"Maybe look into stoicism? I know I was feeling so angsty as a teen for the same red pill reason. Shit happened and I found a ton of support in various life philosophies. Jeet Kune Do, Confucius‚Äôs works, Existentialism and nihilism, even looking at the barebones to major religions. 

Life is really a ride and I don‚Äôt know what the future holds in the current climate of the world(both figuratively and literally), but I know that my happiness and well being is dependent on me, not exterior sources. Sure all this hypocrisy and strife can be a real bummer but I don‚Äôt let it invade me and my emotions or else I wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep up and I‚Äôd probably still locked in my room as a recluse. Mad love for Emily Dickinson. 

When I take an existential nihilistic approach, it‚Äôs like sure, nothing in life matters. But the fact that I am existing and I seek to find happiness and staying in a content state of mind, I make up the rules. Because there are no real rules if nothing matters, I am allowed to make them up, for so far as I can tell, I can only be sure of my existence(solipsism) and therefor my existence and well being should be guided by my tenants that I set forth for myself. 

If I were to live guided by the disgust, strife, fear, sorrow, greed and lust that surrounds me, of course my well being would reflect that(possibly even more so for Fe types). Our souls are one way mirrors, we can either have the light reflect within us so the outside can see inside, or have the light reflect off of us while we see everything outside of us.

"There's no trap here they literally equated midgets being in the NBA to black people being CEOs. You're attempting to change the meaning of that. That's a physical limitation. A born limitation. There's obvious implications of that analogy.

Now if you want to make an argument separate from the other poster about culture being the issue (lets ignore this culture being impacted by hundreds of years of racism and policies from the US government for a second) let me make an analogy that actually fits. The NBA didn't have many foreigners in it a while back. Seeing this and the opportunity for growth the NBA realized foreigners had barriers to playing in the league (FIBA rules, less basketball training, small amounts of outreach to young children) and decided to try their hardest to make up for that with initiatives to get foreigners interested in basketball. Now the NBA has gone from being 7% foreign players to 25% in the last 20 years and that number is constantly rising."

"So I have a question and I would really love if someone could help me out.

My neighbor has a very beautiful dog that looks a lot like this one but has one blue eye. He is super sweet and never gets any attention.

He‚Äôs always left outside, no matter the weather. He‚Äôs tied up on the side of their house, (the same side that connects to my yard), and nobody ever plays with him or pets him. They also have 2 (maybe 3 now) kittens that always hang out around my house. Neither of them have collars and never go inside and the only interaction they ever get is from me or my other neighbor who is kind of a crazy cat lady.

My question though, is it okay for me to pet and talk to the dog over the fence? Like, legally? I would take him for walks and things if I were able but I‚Äôm afraid to approach the neighbors like that. But if it won‚Äôt get me in any trouble I would more than love to spend some time petting and talking to the dog when I‚Äôm able."

"On subject but off; the first time my husband got the wobbles was when were surfing. He said to me ""my eyes are doing something weird, like I can see and all but they are moving by themself"". This was hurricane swell and busy moving so it took a good 20 minutes to figure what it was as I had measured out our doses the night before. He got excited because of a big day and took double.

Taking too much will definitely cause it. Also all strains are different in alkaloids. I love greens üíò and some yellow. 

We were just out on a fishing trip and for some reason he took that mix and it happened again. Was kind of cute because he saw bites that weren't there for 20 minutes. 

As for solution, always take less if any strain you get first because some are just wobbly to your body chemistry. I almost would not even bother with kratom without greens. His is whites.

There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that the bad alkaloids will stack. What I mean is I see alot of people say they got a wonky strain just to put it back for a month after the ""choice strain"" was out and it was wonderful. I was just reminded of this the other day when I threw up. Was out of the blue because I took less that normal. Was of a new strain combo though. "

"&gt; Why does it matter what the contents of your partner's black box actually are?

It matters because the capacity of individuals to exert sexual and emotional effort can be affected by their expenditure of similar efforts towards other people. 

If I come home from a night out having played Dungeons &amp; Dragons with my friends, I might be very interested in having sex with my nesting partner. If instead I come home after a wild night of sex with someone else, I likely don't have the energy to be enthusiastic about being sexually intimate with my nesting partner. That loss can be very significant for people. 

I completely disagree with the notion that it shouldn't matter to my partner how I spend my time and effort outside of her when it has the capacity to affect the time I spend with her, and I even contend that it always will. Very few of us have the luxury of time. 

&gt;If you want to be completely mercenary about it, you have a ""net gain"" anytime your partner goes off into their black box and has a satisfying experience, no matter what it is.

I do, however, agree with this. Seeing one's partner happy is a wonderful thing. "

"yes illegal immigration does pool the benefits. feel free to google this stuff yourself. when immigrants come in and work for below minimum wage that negatively impacts low skilled american workers and positively impacts people who own the companies that now have cheaper labor. its common sense that we need to tax these companies to redistribute the wealth to those who were negatively impacted. if you accept the very basic premise that an increase in the labor supply will put downward pressure on wages then it‚Äôs easy to reach this conclusion. in sure you could gin up some economic model where over the long term? it helps low skilled workers although you certainly have not made that case. but today, right now, increasing the number of workers is going to make the labor less valuable."

"It's not efficient. It's awful when you look at how many resources you guys put into your military. All it's used for is imperialism and it's doubtful it's even beneficial for the US as a nation because there are increasing numbers of actors that intend to use WMD on you and will when the world ends because of catastrophic climate change (for which the US is greatly responsible, among others). 

The US military has never been truly tested. It's always fought against puny backwater states, emaciated farmers and bearded men in robes. Even WW2 wasn't impressive. All they did was clean up after the USSR already did all the hard work. 

The whole point of the US army is basically create this fear factor but it can be defeated if you have the courage to stand up against it. 

Trump has threatened NK with invasion dozens of times and in the end Trump was forced to submit. KJU totally outplayed him and managed to get himself on an equal footing with the US. A summit like that usually reserved for major geopolitical powers like Russia or China. 

Even Russia is just rolling all over the US with their cyberwarfare. Some say Putin's meddling in the elections was like pearl harbour. I'd say it's far worse - it's a decisive victory in a war against the US. The amount of damage he has inflicted on the US...It'll take the US years if not decades to recover from that. The US might not even recover from it at all."

"It's because Brunei and Singapore are using the UK education system where the focus is mainly on English-based subjects. Although in Singapore, Chinese are the majority but the education system and even as far as the daily language used is still English (singlish).

There are Chinese schools in both Sg and Brunei but the education system still remains the same. Chinese language is only considered as an 'additional subject'.

Whereas in Malaysia, they have Chinese schools that every subject is in Mandarin. Plus Malaysia's education system is more gearing towards using Malay and Mandarin language.  That's why in Malaysia especially the east side, more people are fluent in Mandarin/Chinese language and  Bahasa Melayu MORE than people who are fluent in English. Some don't even speak English at all because they use their native language."

"You aren‚Äôt wrong. My husband‚Äôs a financial advisor and he gets questions about when to allow kids to access their trusts all the time just because of this issue.

But the missing piece in your question is that the parents with these questions often have access to the money in a revocable trust (it‚Äôs their gift, not an insurance settlement) and will tap it on their child‚Äôs behalf for college, vehicles or down payments on homes. Or, they‚Äôll distrubute the interest, but keep the principle in the trust. So, it makes sense to bar access until the child is older, but he‚Äôs never seen one where the child is older than 35. It‚Äôs possible, he‚Äôs just never seen it.

The money management practices of that level of clientele isn‚Äôt necessarily to protect the child from themselves, but to guard generational wealth. It‚Äôs a completely different purpose."

So how in the world did this DREAM TEAM with unlimited money deliver a product with a serious design flaw to you?  And now you cant get a better engineered version 2 because they just fired Iribe and his rift 2 ambitions went with him.  I am really beginning to understand your frustration now.

You  have put all this money into the oculus store, and if/when you leave to another platform to get away from this design flaw, you lose all that money.  What would it take for Oculus to make this right by you?  A full refund of your oculus rift purchase price and a full refund of all the software you bought?


Could you elaborate more why you went with the rift over the other solutions to begin with?  Were you convinced like many others that carmach, abrash, iribe, luckey, etc were the DREAM TEAM and facebook money was unlimited and no way in the world would you have ever believed they would ship an hmd to the public with design and engineering issues?  Or was it something else?  Do you think this design flaw should raise things to the level of a class action lawsuit?  What would give you justice? /u/palmerluckey should personally give you your money back (he has billions) and fix this for you.  I will ask him.  Palmer, help this VR user, don't be greedy.

Schwarzenegger being used to lead generations of young men into bodybuilding is one of the sickest things I've seen in modern society. He was without a doubt doing roids at age 15 to get that big for his 16 year old Body Building contest. No matter how well one trains they're not building a body like that at 16 without roids. So many want to defend their lies and heroes they refuse to have their fantasy bubble popped. Many of these modern Christian stars everyone is praising are doing the same type of deceptive things. Many young men have harmed themselves trying to be like these roid users and pop pastors.

Our teacher really emphasized that point and told us that if we're ever with peers who are too drunk to drive, even though it's technically illegal in California for someone with a learners permit to drive without a licensed driver over the age of 25, everyone getting home safe is more important."

"From my experience, atheism seems to be more of a concept in countries where Christianity is prevalent. In Asian countries, where Buddhism and Taoism are prevalent (Taiwan and China), people don't talk about being atheists. When the topic of religion comes up, people would just say that they are not religious and that would be the end of that conversation. When someone specifically says that they're atheist, it is always in the context of the Christian god.

That's probably why you don't see athesist discussion on deities of Eastern religions.

"RDTSC retreives a register that (essentially) increments with every clock cycle. The general approach is to get that counter, run some code, then get the counter again. You can subtract the two counter readings to learn how many clock cycles passed between the two readings.

Your assignment will be a bit difficult because you have to make your assembly code compatible with the C code that's hosting it. That's just the nature of using inline assembly.

Intel has a [whitepaper about timing code execution using RDTSC](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/ia-32-ia-64-benchmark-code-execution-paper.pdf), which will give a lot more details than I care to write out.

"Half of this episode was boring has hell, the other half was a masterpiece.

I pretty much fell asleep whenever the kids were on screen, but every scene with Korra and Toph was great.

What would have improved the episode for me, is if Ikki had been captured by one of Kuvira's concentration camps, instead of the cringy Earth Empire soldiers. (I really hated them.)

Kuvira's camp could have been filled with all the swamp benders that she had been rounding up as she carved through the swamp. It could have been a relatively PG light-hearted thing - I'm not expecting any Auschwitz parallels. Watching Ikki befriend the swamp benders as they recollect the atrocities Kuvira put them through would have been a really fun story I bet. I can imagine that would be funny.

It would have been cool to see Jinora and Meelo work together to free them all (a great opportunity to make a callback to the floating prison episode in the first show!) with their part of the story ending as a swamp bender directs them to the Banyan Grove Tree, explaining how it connects the entire world, and how they could connect to it to find Korra - perfectly tying into the rest of the episode without changing anything about Toph and Korra's half.

All in all, great episode that I think was a waste of some potential. They could have killed two birds in one stone by reducing the obnoxious humor and giving more insight to Kuvira's war crimes.

**Ingredients**

*Levain Build (From 07:30  - 18:00)*

100% mature levain

100% AP flour

100% whole wheat flour

200% water



*Dough*

95% white flour

5% whole wheat flour

1.8% salt

72% water (28.3 C)

25% levain

1.8% diastatic malt*


**Method**

1. Levain-in autolyse for 1 hr.

2. Add salt, mix using pincer method. Put in oiled bowl and do one set of north, south, east, west stretch &amp; folds then flip. Leave for 1 hr.

3. Repeat stretch &amp; folds, leave for 50 min.
 
4. Repeat stretch &amp; folds, leave for 50 min.

5. Preshape dough into boules and bench rest for 20 min.

6. Final shaping, then put into 50/50 rice flour/wheat flour dusted bannetons. Retard overnight in the fridge for approx 18 hours.

7. Bake in preheated Dutch oven at 230 C. 25 minutes lid on 20 minutes lid off. Needed another 3 minutes so the bread didn't look anemic when it came out (bold bake fan here).




*the high water temperature and use of diastatic malt were to combat the ambient temperature of 18 C in my house. I generally try to maintain a dough temperature of 24-25 C for this recipe. I ended up having to put the dough in a turned-off but gently heated oven for 4 or 5 minutes too to bring the temp up.

"It hasn't even been out for 12 hours yet and we've already had a dozen posts about the prices of ships. Well over half of the economy doesn't exist yet and somehow people think they know exactly how it will all work and that it's going to be bad. Then we have people like you who put incredibly misleading, clickbaity titles to get attention. 

UEC was never meant to be 1:1 from purchase to ingame. If it were, you'd be paying about 40'000 UEC for an Aurora, 350,000 for a Reclaimer or Orion, only 3 Milllion for a Javelin, etc. Im sure you can see the problem with that. In-Game ship values have to be balanced against the ingame economy (which is only half built), not the real world costs of UEC. 

So, rather than talking about ""$220 for an Aurora"", lets talk about 220,000 UEC for an Aurora. Why is that unreasonable? Just using the current metrics (which will likely change) mining in a prospector can make you a MINIMUM of about 5000 UEC every 20 or so minutes. 220,000 / 5 = 44 trips * 20 minutes   = 880 total minutes / 60 = about 15 hours. 14 hours to buy a start ship. Sounds a little high right? That's a High estimate that doesn't factor in refining materials, selective mining, the prospector's saddle bags, etc which could easily cut that time in half if not more. So on average, just using the prospector as a basis, you're looking at 3-5 days (assuming an average playtime of 2hrs a day). Now here's the interesting bit. All of that, every bit of it, is assuming CIG doesn't change ANYTHING. If they lower the price of ships slightly, increase ore values slightly, increase valuable ore spawns/quantities slightly, or a number of other factors, that time goes down. 

Mining isn't the only profession though. Lets say all you have is a starter package with a basic Aurora. We saw a mission being run at Citcon which netted the player 4000. It took him about 30 minutes to run, and he was going SLOW. An actual player who's not trying to show off the game for a presentation could do that in half the time if not better. 4000 every 15 minutes, and you're looking at about 14hrs and you've got your ship's value in UEC to spend. Again, this is using the current numbers which will almost definitely ALL change.

TL:DR, don't look at USD, look at UEC. 220k UEC for an Aurora isn't that bad. Maybe a little high. All the econ-numbers are first iteration, unbalanced, untested (that's what we're here for), and will be tweaked to get better results."

"What do you mean when you say ""side effect?""

The reason we get along with dogs is because of a genetic disposition to emotionally connect to them.  It's symbiotic. We take this a step further, and select out traits we don't like and keep traits we do like when breeding dogs.  This amplifies this emotional connection.

It's just like how most important traffic signs are yellow and red because these colors stick out to us.  There's nothing inherently special to these colors on their own that gives them this property, it's the way that our genes determine how we process and prioritize color, that makes yellow and red more apparent than blue or green."

"I mostly use mine for benching because I squat high bar. 

For squatting. It‚Äôs a little nice just because it‚Äôs a thicker bar. I‚Äôm too cheap to buy a squat bar, so it‚Äôs really only comparable to that because it is a thicker bar (32 mm I think). I‚Äôve used a squat bar and I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs better than having a squat bar. 

I bought it for bench because I wanted a little more ROM with it. The problem is you have to bench really, really wide in order to get more out of the curve. Because it‚Äôs a longer range of motion you have to touch lower than you normally do. If you don‚Äôt it‚Äôll feel awkward. If you‚Äôre weak off the chest (which is probably where 90% of people fail), it‚Äôs going to feel awkward. 

I think it‚Äôs a fine bar. It‚Äôs nice to have, but as a high bar squatter I knew I‚Äôd get less out of it than most people. My main issues:

I wish the knurling was more aggressive. For something that‚Äôs meant primarily for low bar squatting, I was expecting more bite. It‚Äôs annoying to rack/unrack. Would‚Äôve been nice if they had an area with a flat edge so it wouldn‚Äôt roll or sit odd in a rack. Price is ridiculous, but that‚Äôs an issue they‚Äôre not likely to change any time soon"

The bootstrap Christian attitude goes back to Calvinist Protestantism. Hard work and frugality is rewarded by god with material gain. So if you‚Äôre rich it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a good Christian and if you‚Äôre poor it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre sinful and lazy. So it‚Äôs not a big stretch that the poor should always be punished because obviously they‚Äôre bad sinful people. Amazing how the most basic teachings of Jesus are ignored by ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù.

"I raided TBC and WotLK, quit, then came back in Legion. I really enjoyed ""completing"" my character. I had a BIS list for my spec and did the raids that my gear comes from and it felt really good to check off one of my BIS items. It's not the only reason I raid, or even the main reason, but it was still a really good feeling anyways.

Now my character is never complete. Not even close. The closest I can get is legendaries/azerite gear because even though there were BIS trinkets and tier before, they still had to forge with ilvl and sockets and tertiaries to be ""BIS"". And the gear that isn't a trinket or tier/azerite is all mostly unimportant what it is or it's secondary stats as long as it forges up to beat the ilvl of my current gear. There's nothing that I will see and say to myself ""Look at the stats on that! It's absolutely perfect for me, I need to get that exact gear."" All gear is nameless and samey now, only ilvl and sockets matter which is so boring and unmotivating to me. YET I felt pressured to do Heroic raid (not mandatory) every week on my main JUST INCASE something Lottoforged so I could help make prog easier. Same with M+10/15 if I didn't feel like doing it that week I still had to like it was a chore.

Legendaries were good and bad in that regard because I could get my BIS and they can't forge but their acquisition had so much RNG bullshit baggage attached. I got my 2 ST BIS in my 3rd last and last leggos for my spec.

But now Titanforging is even worse because of forced Personnal Loot. I can't even give away gear half the time because of it. I can safely say my raid team is behind a week because of awful RNG loot assignment, there's been so many wasted weapons and trinkets and rings between raiding and M+.

M+ progression is the only thing I can say Titanforging is good for but even then I'm sure they could have made a better system."
"Hey, experienced psychonaut here, is this your first time tripping? I wish you a wonderful time! I'd say to keep these key things in mind.

1. It's just a drug you may feel overwhelmed at times, good or bad, but this feeling will go away.

2. Stay hydrated! I always make sure to drink plenty of water and keep it near.

3. I always take an iBuprofen or two before, helps prevent vasoconstriction, acid always makes my body feel really tight and this prevents that!

4. Have a good time, do whatever YOU feel like doing and be safe :)

"You're forgetting some important details about what happened in the garage.

"I actually agree with most of what cryptogrip said. It is irrelevant but only relevant for people who are obsessed with trends and data correlations. As for Bitcoin‚Äôs price, it has no impact. People won‚Äôt look at a price a year ago and be like...it‚Äôs now lower than it was a year ago, time to sell. I just it‚Äôs FUD or FOMO...tied entirely to emotions and Bitcoin value. If somebody told me Donald Trump would be President in 2013, I would disregard them...just being honest. Of course in a country where rural rednecks in flyover states ended up deciding the election, Trump can be president. And in a very progressive country like Canada, marijuana can be legalized. However, if somebody told me that 5 yrs ago, I wouldn‚Äôt believe it. The current state can really blind your outlook in both positive and negative directions. Well said, Cryptogrip."

Bro this is the 80th time I‚Äôve seen you post pictures of yourself asking for some sort of validation. If you keep that way of thinking up you‚Äôre going to die a virgin. Stop worrying about the way you look and go make something of yourself. You can be a super ugly motherfucker and if you have confidence and have a well put together life girls will come. But this beta boy post that you repeatedly make begging for people to tell you how you look is pathetic and will not make any girl attracted to you.

"I think it's too early to say Curse of Osiris doesn't really go anywhere. As you say Dark Below setup a few elements that were essential to a later expansion. I don't think it's out of the question that CoO will eventually play the same role, even though its TtK expansion hasn't come as soon as it did for Dark Below. I mean, I think that Bungo actually already has the whole story planned out more or less (as partly evinced by the hints at the later DLC we now notice in the vanilla, e.g., Rasputin possessing Ghost and having him say something about ice caps on Mars, in that one Io adventure--the same one that featured the classical-music-playing sleeper nodes of Warmind, IIRC), and that it's only the details of the story (including the tone) that are occasionally being revised as necessary. You just don't start a franchise as big and expensive as this without having a complete story arc planned out in at least broad strokes--i mean, if you don't have even that, then good luck getting anyone to invest a dime into your venture. That being the case, I feel comfortable in saying that by the end it'll be clear that most of D2Y1 was just setting the stage for what was to come. We already see minor hints of this in Forsaken, wherein, e.g., the curse of the Dreaming City is said by Osiris to seem like something the Vex would do (I think the Vex or Taken-Vex are almost certainly involved FWIW), and I don't think that will be the last we hear from Osiris and his Vex-expertise. So, I dunno, maybe what I'm saying is, just wait before you write off Bungo's storytelling, I guess."

All being fair in love and war, I propose also that we can - and arguably should - make semi-credible RWNJ sockpuppets of our own dedicated to posing as them while strawmanning and undermining their propaganda.  It's easier for us because they are the source material in themselves. Can't be hard to lampoon them when they inadvertently self-own all day.

"Sorry for reviving a dead post, but my life turned upside down (not really huge, but I got overwhelmed with stuff) during the past two weeks.

&gt;It's pure hormonal biology. Care to define what you mean by better sex education? People have been trying to stop teenagers having sex for a long time, and don't tend to succeed very well.

Currently, Puritan/religious sex education needs to stop. Abstinence-only education is crap. Teens need better sex education to understand when and when not they should have sex. Consent needs to be taught, contraception should be taught, cause currently most people are only fed ""Sex is bad and you should go to hell."" or something.

By educating people on a scientific standpoint, people are less likely to experiment.

&gt;the laws are there to prevent harm, and if none is occurring then it seems fine to me. In a healthy relationship, why should it be bad that he doesn't want to discontinue a fun part of said relationship?

It'll be better if there wasn't a law. However, he is desperate to the point of trying to break the law, and if his/her parents (one of them didn't know they were sexually active, and would punish him) caught him, he may be screwed for life. He needs to control his urges, that's all.

&gt;Would you be able to explain further why you find teenage sex to be irresponsible in today's world? I'd like to understand your view further. Thanks for the discussion!

For me, I believe that two teenagers hooking up in a trusting relationship (FWB or dating) is far, far better than a one-time fling at a party.

Still, teens who hook up need to follow 3 basic rules:

1. Shouldn't be illegal in that locality/state
2. Should be able to pay for abortions and contraceptives with their own money
3. Should have family that don't care if teens have sex.
4. Taking nudes is fine in an ideal world, but people do abuse that. So people shouldn't send nudes with faces.

That is an ideal situation. Which OP of the post doesn't meet conditions 1 and 3 (not sure about 2 and 4).

If you would like, I can elaborate why I feel these criteria should be met."

"It's even more specific than that. If which was 40 (or 30, 20 or 15) then it'd pass your else if test. So:

    if(which == 10){
        total+=15;
    }else if(which==2.5||which==5||which==25||which==35||which==45){
        total+=which;

"Yes, this is not true. TransferMarkt is listing potential transfer values, not salaries. 

MLS has a $4 million salary cap, give or take. DPs like Vela or Giovinco count for roughly $500K against the cap. ""Young"" (i.e., under 23 year old) DPs like Rossi and Horta count less against the cap. TAM and GAM can be used to ""buy down"" the cap hit for certain players, too. So even though our wage bill is around $13MM (one of highest in league), it actually fits into the $4MM cap. It's a bit like taxable income and deductions. 

Until there is a big TV deal for the league, this is likely to persist with some small inflation adjustments. The cap is intended to protect the small market teams against the big market teams (like us) or teams with spendy owners (like Atlanta)."

"As much as they are your parents you don't need to justify anything to them. It seems that you are not even asking for anything which more of a reason. However, only you know the relationship with your parents and why they have such negative perception of you. Do what you need to do to feel better about yourself. If you want, explain that what you just said and stay centered even if their response is negative. Accept that they may never accept your lifestyle choices and be ok with that plausible reality.

Why did they test your thyroid? Routine or because you were symptomatic?

If you had symptoms, have they improved?

Blurry vision can be a symptom of HYPERthyroid. If that is the case, you might be very sensitive to the medication to go from hypo to hyper in 2 weeks on 25mg. Can you test again? I wouldn‚Äôt suggest throwing the pills out. Ask your doctor if it‚Äôs on to stop taking them or ween yourself down. 

You can cut a pill in half too. I was having heart palpitations and instead of changing my dose, my doctor had me cut one pill in half one day a week. I was still having them so he said 2 days a week. It‚Äôs more of a totality of medication than one or two doses. After a week with 2 half doses and 5 normal doses, I‚Äôm back to normal.

"Depends on how deeply involved in that line of work he was. I‚Äôve seen sources say he was actually a manager, and graphic design *typically* involves having a degree. Worse yet if he‚Äôs *fired* that is a whole other ball game away from simply ‚Äúchanging careers.‚Äù

IMO it's because modern mma wrestling is geared towards ground and pound instead of just controling the fight by laying on top of the opponent like they did in the past.

I think there's *plenty* of room for disagreement here.  Maybe liking certain characters for certain reasons says something about a person, maybe it doesn't.  But it might be worth talking about, depending on which character they relate to and why they relate to her.

Saying, as OP does, that liking any fictional character is automatically free from criticism, seems obviously false to me.  If Rowling introduced a character who started groping some people and was never talked about again, it would be very suspect if someone found that character relatable.  At least *hypothetically* criticizing people could be justified."

since you won't read it I'll offer some of it:

&gt;Results. Gun ownership was a significant predictor of firearm homicide rates (incidence rate ratio‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.009; 95% confidence interval‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.004, 1.014). This model indicated that for each percentage point increase in gun ownership, the firearm homicide rate increased by 0.9%.

Conclusions. We observed a robust correlation between higher levels of gun ownership and higher firearm homicide rates. Although we could not determine causation, we found that states with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearm-related homicides."

"First off, take a week or two off of ranked. Second, find dedicated teammates to grind ranked with. I guarantee a significant decrease in losses just from avoiding the solo queue. Third, stop doing training packs and just hit the ball around in freeplay. A lot of training pack shots are wayyyy too specific and some are just plain unrealistic. I also recommend doing dribble challenge #2 for ball control. Time yourself for 20-30 minutes a day and see how many levels you can go through in that allotted time. I did this for a month when I started to improve my dribbling and used to take 10 minutes to get to level 11 and now I can complete the map in under 10 minutes.

Ranking up is a lot like bulking and cutting in exercise. You‚Äôll gain a lot of muscle (skill) when bulking but you‚Äôll also bring some fat (bad habits) with it. When you hit a wall (aka tougher opponents), you‚Äôll start cutting (getting rid of the bad habits), but you may also lose some skill as a result of having to adapt. And the cycle repeats, until you reach your desired goal."

"If you are loading classes from another assembly at runtime you can only access those classes using reflection not directly as you appear to be trying to. 

The best way to do this is to use interfaces and then construct classes from the loaded assemblies as the interface your main assembly knows and then you can use it via the interface.

If you don't use an interface than the only option is via reflection where you search for the type in the assembly, then search for the method on the type and invoke it via the methodinfo."

"What I did when I was starting with GW2, having seen those same videos etc., was that I went through the core free game. This goes from level 1 to the level cap and includes the base game story telling the story of your character's rise to prominence and their first major legendary battle (keeping it vague for spoilers). So I played that and I played it until I felt that I had gotten enough entertainment/content to justify the purchase price of, at that point, the only expansion HoT. I can't remember exactly, but I think I reached that in the mid 40's. So that's what I would recommend you do to see if you want to purchase the other expansions. With a big caveat...

&amp;#x200B;

The Core Story that you would experience is from 2012 when the company had a lot of ideas that they were trying. Some would stick, others wouldn't. As a result, there are times when the core story can feel like a patchwork of ideas and oddities. In contrast to this, I feel like the early core story has some of the most meaningful choices and branches in the story. Your character creation info matters for those early stories. You can spend quite a lot of time delving into the same race but making other choices to get different stories, and then go into another race and make MORE different choices to get more varied stories, etc. This all tapers off as you get to the end of the core story and sadly has not reappeared since. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I think most fans would agree that this is Guild Wars 2's heyday. High-quality content is coming out at a record pace and keeps all but the most ritalin-infused busy (god, I still haven't gotten through everything in the previous Living World SEASON let alone the last episode!) and entertained. The story has had a notable eruption in quality in the last \~year and it seems to keep doing really well. The most recent content release (a free-if-you-log-in-when-it's-active piece of content) contained some of the most genuinely emotional content and dramatic ramping-up of the stakes that this game has EVER seen.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps."

This is about $50 more expensive than the Samsung, but has gsync...big aesthetic downside is that its a flat screen, which to be fair I've only ever used, but the idea of a curved seems tantalizing... I don't know what the 166Hz means over 144Hz//whether that makes any difference. It's also 24"" as opposed to 27"" (I'm currently using a 23"")

(3) [Dell - S2716DG 27.0"" 2560x1440 144Hz Monitor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/BcTrxr/dell-monitor-s2716dg)  
This would be the priciest option. Basically, the same as #2 but larger. Unsure again what difference 166/144Hz would make with my setup."

"1. This may not have been what OP meant, but I think giving each team 1 and only 1 repeat at the start of sudden death (regardless of how many they had before) won't necessarily ruin how fast the extra time is supposed to go. At most, it would only be 30 extra seconds, which in my opinion, isn't a whole lot for a 30 minute match. I personally am indifferent about this, I see the merits of both sides, just trying to add clarity.

2. I'm pretty sure what OP meant was that there would be a time limit, and like the team Iron Man match, the team with the most points at the end of say 2 minutes wins. I would be in favor of this. I understand your argument about not wanting 1 teammate to carry the other, but keeping it individual scoring without conferring could yield the same thing; you could have one teammate keeping the team alive, assuming the other team isn't doing so hot either. Also, it makes sense for the teams to work together since it's a team match... Like it or not, having one person carry the other is part of team matches. It might not even be carrying too. What if one of the questions is in a category which is a weakness for one teammate, but a strength for the other? That could be seen as carrying, but it's just an example of a team that fits well together. I tend to agree with Samm when he said the Iron Man format is the absolute best way to determine which team knows more. At the end of 3 or 5 rounds where the teams are tied, I would be perfectly fine with the team that wins the Iron Man sudden death winning the match... Chances are there would be less than 10 matches going into sudden death a year / season, so it's not really that big of a deal."

"And you arguing sales numbers is just ridiculous. Video games aren't movies. Good numbers for video game sales dont make that game a good game. Just that alot of people preordered it. Look at thrones. Look at dead man's sky.

You saying ca does it this way so that's the way it should be is an idiotic argument. More people play warhammer for, you know, warhammer than the stupid arcade functions that ca implemented. People would still play warhammer if it didn't have this arcade playstyle. 

How many times have people complained about your functions on this very reddit. The ones you are saying ca is going forward with? People buy the latest tw because it's the latest ""drug"" that people want to experience. They want it because they have friends that are getting it. Alot of people buying a game doesn't mean its features are great. 

I dont like the red and green dots for units instead of banners in 3kingdoms. In still going to buy it even though I know its going to be arcady and streamlined. Just because someone buys a game and inflates the sales numbers doesn't mean they like ALL the features in the game....

Does you arm hurt from reaching so far with these? I mean, i realise he lacks decorum here, but saying you want to punch someone in the face is a little different than promoting people send fucking explosives the clintons. 

And none of this is really unique to trump. I mean just take a look at the 2016 campaigns and youll see it. The blm movement was a necessary movement but  Do you remember the bullshit ""fuck the police"" mentality being spouted from the left? Painting out the republican party as all racists that want to see them all dead so they could secure the black vote. Despite the most publicized cases for blm movement taking place in DEMOCRATIC controlled cities. It has nothing to do with Republican V democratic but it was hillarys marketing tactics to try and promote violent protests during his political campaign speeches.

"That would go against the philosophy of rogue-like games, where you have one life with no second chances. From the Roguelike wikipedia page:

&gt; The game uses permadeath. Once a character dies, the player must begin a new game, known as a ""run"", which will regenerate the game's levels anew due to procedural generation. A ""save game"" feature will only provide suspension of gameplay and not a limitlessly recoverable state; the stored session is deleted upon resumption or character death. Players can circumvent this by backing up stored game data (""save scumming""), an act that is usually considered cheating; the developers of Rogue introduced the permadeath feature after introducing a save function, finding that players were repeatedly loading saved games to achieve the best results.[8] According to Rogue's Michael Toy, they saw their approach to permadeath not as a means to make the game painful or difficult but to put weight on every decision the player made as to create a more immersive experience.[17]

Of course it's important, I was taught that Slavery was the reason why there was a Civil War and that the one of the reasons southern states would sign the Constitution was if they included the 3/5ths compromise. I also learned about the railroads and how it helped with westward expansion and how migrant workers were a large factor in building those systems in the west.

- Spawn hazards on all rows

- Deal 14 damage to random units

- Spawn a random unit for both players (no deploy effect)

- Destroy an enemy (random)

- Play the top card from your deck

- Boost all units in your hand by 1-2

- Spawn a random hazard on an enemy row

Shupe knight is 8 strength

- Gain resiliance

"You need two licenses, both of which have a class that goes with. It doesn‚Äôt matter what order you do the classes in. You need a gun permit, either FID or LTC(if you‚Äôre of age, just get an LTC) which means you need a basic firearms safety class(with live fire for LTC in some towns); and you need a hunting license, which means you need a hunting safety class. The firearms class will go over the rules and regs for buying, storing, and carrying a gun(concealed or in the hunting context). The hunting class will go over the rules and regs for hunting, what when where, what to wear, reporting, bag limits, the whole Megillah. 

Once you have a gun license, and a hunting license for the species you want to hunt, you‚Äôll need a gun for it. You cant hunt deer with a centerfire rifle in MA(but you can hunt bear with one, so figure that one out). You can get a shotgun for deer, and with a small modification use the same gun for turkey and other winged prey. You can hunt deer, turkey, bear with a bow and then you wouldn‚Äôt need gun license.

Once you‚Äôre properly licensed and armed, you need a spot to hunt. This is the part that sucks. You need to find public land that has the species your after, or get permission to hunt private land. Then you might need a stand or blind, decoys, calls, clothing and on and on. Without someone to guide you through all this step by step, you‚Äôre going to spend a crapload of time researching. The good news, i guess contextually its good news, is that it can take months to get a gun license, so you probably arent getting into the woods this year anyway so you can space this spending extravaganza over nearly a year and pick away at your research."

About the process that Derubis uses: he has promotional videos which we watch, and which you can find on YouTube.

Whenever you collect a Derubis, we are obligated to let you know that each one is made to order so it could take a bit of extra time for shipping. I wish I could let you know the real caliber of their ""uniqueness,"" but since his processes are secretive, I can't.  We know he uses chemicals, fire, chainsaws, etc...but how he uses them, well, his secrecy is so that no one copies him.

The mysteries are less expensive because they're often regular (unframed) lots in VERY LARGE edition sizes. If it's a CP mystery, (framed, typically embellished or on metal) then the Auctioneer will offer them at bottom line or with computer based promotional discounts applied. These discounts can be applied at any time, it just makes for good sales theater to offer them on the Auction block.

2. **Parlays Do NOT Improve Your Odds or Your Profitability**: Parlaying those games together isn't going to magically make non-profitable odds profitable - you're still getting the exact same odds in a parlay. The reason you see higher payouts is because you're rolling over your winnings from 1 game to the next. Thus, you have higher risk and a far greater likelihood of losing your entire stake. It has nothing to do with improving odds."

"No ancient ever wrote a complete account of his or her life, including all events and things they said.  They may have written self-edited accounts of various important events, but those accounts inevitably involve some form of self-aggrandizement or reframing of behavior for the target audience.

There is no indication that Jesus would have perceived he was founding a ""major new religion"" as the very focus of his claims was rooted in the beliefs of the Judean people, a perspective shared by all the New Testament authors.  That ""major new religion"" is something that developed later, with a progressive severing of those Judean roots.  Christianity today, even the relatively ancient forms of the eastern churches, would be totally alien and incomprehensible to first century Christians."

Stafford started the season off poorly. Even after the Jets game, Stafford was putting up numbers, but not performing in key moments. Was it off the wall to think that handling a growing family was taking a toll? 

He also hammers Stafford for being a poorly spoken guy to the press. And he is. He‚Äôs not good in interviews, and typically stumbles through them without actually saying anything of value.

He questioned Patricia‚Äôs approach to the preseason. Plenty of people did, even if you ignore the Monarrez piece, it was a well known topic that the team was getting pushed more than usual. And when the team came out that flat in the first two weeks, it was a legitimate critique.

Okay. Why are you so angry?  it sounds like you are very unhappy with yourself. And your life.
"&gt; there should be a system of pre-emptive withholding

Nooo, I can't agree with this. Preemptive withholding is taxpayers giving the government an interest-free loan. It doesn't serve taxpayers interests' to have money withheld from them that they don't even owe yet. Financially, you are better off having a debt to be repaid in the future than having money taken off you earlier than it needs to be.

Also, you're missing an important distinction between income tax and residence tax. Income tax is a tax on income, so as soon as you earn income, you have a tax liability. It doesn't matter what happens subsequently‚Äîmerely earning the income is sufficient to create the liability. However, residence tax is not a tax on income, it's a tax on *residence*. Yes, the *magnitude* of the liability is determined by your past income, but the liability itself is created by the fact of being resident on January 1, not the fact of earning income.

So if you were to introduce withholding for residence tax, you would be forcing taxpayers to give the government an interest-free loan with respect to a liability that may or may not exist in the future. It's one thing to withhold for income tax, where the liability already exists, but it would be another thing altogether to withhold for residence tax, where the liability doesn't even exist yet. 

Given that withholding is never strictly in the taxpayer's interests, the government needs to have a very good justification for imposing it. Arguably that justification does exist with respect to income tax, but I can't see the same justification applying to residence tax, at least while residence tax remains a tax on residence rather than income. 

What I would possibly support is abolishing residence tax altogether and folding the 10% residence tax into the income tax rates. But that would require a huge transfer of financial power from local governments to the national government, which local governments would understandably fight tooth-and-nail. And in a battle between local governments and national governments my instinct is to back the local governments, so it would be a tough call for me.

&gt; you get these odd scenarios where the first year you start working, you don't have to pay any residence tax. Then the next year you get hit with a big bill

That only seems odd if you're an employee who is used to the withholding system though. Don't forget that a significant proportion of income earners are not employees (self-employed, business owners, freelancers, etc.), and thus not subject to income tax withholding. (Admittedly, withholding does apply to some kinds of self-employed people in some cases, but the broader point stands). 

For those people, the *normal* method of taxation (both income and residence) is to get a big bill at the end of the year, once they add up their yearly earnings and file a return. So for those people, there's nothing odd about their tax liability for 2018 coming due in 2019, for example. Whether you consider the ""charge in arrears"" residence tax system to be odd merely depends on what you're used to.

&gt; I wish everything could just be kept more current

*Why*, though? The only reason a taxpayer should prefer withholding is if they have poor self-control or financial literacy. If that's your reason, then fair enough‚ÄîI won't hold that against you. But I don't think it's fair to ask the government to force *all* taxpayers to give them an interest-free loan, merely because *some* taxpayers have poor self-control or financial literacy. I suppose you could argue that residence tax withholding should be made optional, and I wouldn't necessarily disagree with you about that, but I think it's an open question as to whether the increased convenience to some taxpayers would be worth the administrative costs of providing the option.

&gt; the unemployment insurance benefits I received didn't even come close to the total I had to pay in residence tax and health insurance premiums after I was out of work. For someone in my position but without substantial savings - I can see that leading to a very bad situation.

I don't really understand this point. If the total amount you had to pay over the (say) two-year period, including both time employed and time unemployed, was the same, and the total amount you received over that two-year period was the same, then your financial situation at the end of that period should also be the same, regardless of whether you had to pay small proportions periodically or pay everything at the end of the period. (Actually, to be precise, your financial situation should be slightly better in the latter case.)

But you seem to be implying that you (or someone with less savings, at least) would have been better off if you had been paying small proportions periodically. That only makes sense with respect to a person who has poor self-control or financial literacy. For most people, it should make no difference whether they pay 10k/month, for example, or 120k at the end of the year. If anything, paying 120k at the end of the year should be slightly preferable, from a financial perspective (assuming no deflation, etc.)."

When you get your product my suggestion would be to just sit there and roll till you get a smokeable joint, then unroll it and keep at it till you get a joint you‚Äôd love to smoke. Don‚Äôt worry about filters or anything of the like, this will just complicate things. Roll on an angle, take your paper without  any product in it and make a crease starting from the bottom of the left side to the top of the right side. Once you have that diagonal fold in the paper, it becomes easy to load your product in. Make it so there is considerably less product on the left ‚Äúskinny side‚Äù as there is in the top ‚Äúfat side‚Äù. This should be quite obvious if you pre-folded the paper like I said above^^. Once you have this arrangement, begin to roll the top of the paper over the bottom of the paper. Once you have it tightly arranged where there is more product on the ‚Äúfat side‚Äù than there is on the ‚Äúskinny side‚Äù now comes the hardest part. In a decently succinct motion, roll the top part of the paper over the bottom part of the paper using your right index finger ( I just realized I‚Äôm explaining this from a right handed perspective so I hope you‚Äôre not left handed lol!!!). The index finger is key because you can kind of lay it across the pre-rolled joint to tuck the paper inside, once this tuck is achieved then the joint is pretty much done. Just make sure the paper is tucked then lick the adhesive. If you tucked it tight enough, you should have room at the top to lick the whole sticky, if not you either didn‚Äôt pre fold the paper right or you didn‚Äôt tuck the weed in tight enough to be rolled. I don‚Äôt know how to send you a video, otherwise I totally would if you can tell me how . Pre rolls tend to made with trimmings/bottom bags, id love (and tbh I think you would too) if you could roll your own with the best product out there to offer.

"I had a very liberal upbringing myself (I'm 18, so still basically a kid, but old enough to understand myself). At the start of high school, couple years back, I started to get afraid because of the political atmosphere, and I wouldn't say I was turning into an extreme red pill or anything like that, but as a white straight male I was freaking out thinking ALL my fellow liberals wanted my head, down with the patriarchy, etc.

I started dating a brilliant, kind, beautiful Lebanese girl sophomore year, and seeing some of her struggles and caring about her life put me back on what I see as the right track. I'm now certain of my ideals as a moderate liberal (sometimes nigh centrist, I suppose). I have her to thank for keeping me in check when misinformation in the media almost controlled my opinions."

I know historically human skin has been used to make leather, but (and I only have a few weird history channel shows to go on from when they actually did history stuff) isn't it usually used mostly for very thin applications like book binding?  (apparently most major research libraries have some samples in their collection, so there is your creepy fact of the day.)

So, I can see using it for making books, but I'm not as sure for leather armor.  (Blood Magic should totally create human skin bound books for something if they haven't already.)

So, that's my thought on it.  I mean, maybe you could add a 'human leather' that could be used for books?  Books and written books are pretty decent trades for librarian villagers.

"Title: [CA] My younger brother has been stealing money, my parents refuse to do anything about it.

Original Post: 

&gt; I am 17 (18 in two months) and my brother is about to turn 15.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; Just a little background info, since starting high school, my parents decided to start giving me $30 every month in case I want to buy food or something for myself. I used it mainly for snacks and video games and I could get around fine without spending all of it so I just started saving up. 
&gt; 
&gt; A few months ago I started to notice that my money was disappearing faster than I was spending it. I thought it was just me being dumb and forgot about it, but it didn't stop and I mostly ignored it though it was weird. I realized something was up when suddenly $30 disappeared from my wallet. I was almost certain it was my brother and sure enough, he bought a $30 game two days later about which I was informed via email (my brother uses my old steam\* account that he bought from me a few years ago, it still has my email linked to it). I told my mom but she said he probably saved up from his birthday or something and to drop it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now my brother is my parents' favorite child. They basically disowned my sister and don't like me mainly because I'm still in contact with her and I don't agree with most of their views. My brother doesn't do good in school, has obvious anger issues (throws tantrums when he doesn't get his way and breaks mostly my things in the process) and barely ever does what he's told. My mom likes him too much to do anything at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Three months ago I got a part time job because I wanted to start saving up for a car. Me and my parents agreed that they would stop giving me money since I can support myself.
&gt; 
&gt; Last week, $200 disappeared from my wallet. I immediately told my mom who got angry at me for ""not taking proper care of my money"". 3 days later, I got an email from steam again that the total of 200 US Dollars was added to my account. 
&gt; 
&gt; I showed the email to my mom and she still refuses to do anything about it. I don't think I can refund the money and I don't even want to image what my parents would do if I tried. I want to know what I can do here, as I have worked hard for my money and this is theft but my brother is still only 14.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; Just for the record, my parents said they don't want me to have a bank account yet and I can't hide money in my room because I share it with my brother and the only person who could maybe help and look after my money is my grandma, but she lives almost 3 hours away.

Some paparazzi are cool. TMZ seems to post lots of clips where their cameramen provoke some pretty funny interactions with stars. The stars seem to like it when the TMZ guy asks unusual or funny shit.

"Why are they fighting? Are they loyal servants of the bbeg who would die for their leader? Intimidation would be pretty ineffective against them. Do they think your party are the bad guys? Persuasion may not work, depending more on the circumstance. If you give your bad guys motivations for their actions they can react to what your players do. 

Say a minion is fighting because his family is held hostage by the bbeg. A player who tries to intimidate them out of fighting by threatening to hurt them will have a harder time because they're more concerned for their family. But a player who tries to understand the bad guy and persuade him that they can help him might have an easier time "

"I can get that when worded that way.

I personally just saw it as ""to do what we need to do we need to get actual ""power"" in areas so even if this area wasn't really necessary to Corypheus's plot it was relevant towards expanding our realm of influence.  I agree he was a week threat but I liked that I had ways of not focusing on him completely and that the focus was really on my character trying to lead a powerful government (with almost no governing land) to do a thing without having things fall apart.

The edit you put in would've probably been a really good middle ground there.  I don't think we needed more urgency, as I like being able to know despite the big threat I can pretend it's paused due to ""finding leads"" while I go on separate adventures.  Saying that aloud though I can see how I might be in the minority there and others would rather have some level of cohesion that doesn't just tell you to go somewhere else instead of doing the thing you needed to do.  It would have been more cohesive if they made more of a focus on why you're going to places beyond just ""some high up person here asked for your assistance"" and have each area tired into something with Corypheus's plan to them branch out into their own paths.

Would've also helped if there were just more enemy varieties too."

"I just had to do that 10 minutes ago. Even if it just lasted for one month including two weeks of texting prior to dating, I felt I had to do it the right way. I mean I would not have ghosted her as I think it is the douchiest thing somebody can do. I did not want to say it by text so I called her. If we would have been dating for more than that I would probably have chose to do it in person.

I was feeling bad before doing it as being very little experimented in dating in general, it was the first time I had to (the other times, I was the rejected/dumped). I went straight to the point and basically said ''I am sorry but I don't want to continue seeing you''. She asked if there was a particular reason and I said no even if I could have mentioned many things. I just did not want to say things that could have been misinterpreted or would have make her feel bad. 

She took it well and said she was kind of feeling the same but that she was ready to try a bit more, that two weeks was pretty quick to decide that. Anyhow, I am happy it went well and that we can both move on now. Still, I kind of feel empty and weird, we were texting everyday, seeing each other a lot and now nothing. Thanks to the guy who posted a few days ago about what to do when you have a gut feeling it is not gonna work and to the people who commented. This helped in my decision. I will take a break from dating for a little while as I need to rethink about what I am looking for and because I am so fucking busy these days and I don't feel like being involved in some other romance for now.

"They base it on surveys and past performance - it's all explained here:

https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/consumer-reports-car-reliability-faq/

Data on over 500,000 vehicles from 2000 to 2018 based on an annual questionnaire that members take. 

As for long term reliability on 2018 models:

&gt;The Predicted Reliability, also called New Car Prediction, forecasts how well a new model that is currently on sale is likely to hold up based on its recent history. For this Rating, we average a model's Overall Reliability score for the newest three years, provided the vehicle did not change significantly in that time and hasn't been redesigned for the current model year. Over the years, we have found that several years of data are a better predictor than the most recent model year alone. One or two years of data may be used if the model was redesigned within that three-year time frame, or if there were insufficient data for some years.

&gt;We will make a prediction for a brand new or redesigned model, or a model with insufficient data, based on the manufacturer‚Äôs track record, history of the previous generation, or similar models that shared the same components. Of course, this is only a prediction, and these scores are not a guarantee of the reliability of any individual car. However, buying a car that has an above-average score for Predicted Reliability will reduce the likelihood of having significant problems with your car.

"Sugaring. Tried once and I will never go back to shaving. But, if you prefer shaving, use a bikini razor. Trim first with the trimmer before you use the shaver. Shave when showering (or wet the area), don't shave dry. I never shave my inner labia tho, only a few hair there anyway, I use a nurse scissor to cut them (but be REALLY CAREFUL). Also, make sure you pull the skin so it's tight. And moisturize / toner after.

But, my best advice would be to try sugaring. Do it with with a beautician first for a few times to get an idea how to pull the skin etc. Once you can do it yourself, it's super cheap and effective. It lasts 4 to 6 weeks and the new hair will be sooo thin. Amazing."

From what I've seen, each series looks worst than the last one, Ash is in school now. It's still decent by kids show standards compared to a lot of stuff today like Teen Titans Go though."

"&gt; You have someone who is political (Ada) attempting to make something that is an extension of their ideology spread onto all these repos.... To your statement on ""why does this matter"", because I will not give an inch to someone spreading their political ideologies like this into programming when I find it to be detrimental. I find this to be a power play to simply put it. 

...how, though, given that the actual result -- the actual text being proposed -- is something you don't even think is bad?

Because this attitude is starting to sound less like the reasonable person I assumed you are, and more like an attitude I'm getting from a lot of right-wing people: That they don't seem to care about what's actually best for anyone, they only care about ""librul tears."" It sounds a lot like what you're trying to say here is: ""There's nothing objectionable in the covenant itself, I just don't want Ada to win, because she wants this covenant for the wrong reasons.""

Do I have that right? Because that's petty as hell.

If there *is* something objectionable, sorry I missed it, but I've asked you repeatedly, and the most you've said so far is that you find some of the stuff *unnecessary.* And I think I gave some examples of why it is actually necessary:

&gt; No one complained about Ruby's CoC, like I've said already, because it's not political. For your example with Matt, yes that is obviously a bad idea to use pornstars, but that's obvious because you wouldn't do that in a typical professional setting...

You'd think so, but again, *it wasn't obvious to Matt.* I mean, I literally just gave you an existence proof of the need for this level of clarification. And that's something the Ruby CoC lacks.

I asked you a direct question last time, and I'd like an answer here: Would you object to the Contributor Covenant if that first ""Our Pledge"" section stopped after the words ""harassment-free experience for everyone""? If so, which part do you have a problem with? Or do you only have a problem with it having the wrong person as an author?

&gt; ...it has nothing to do with identity politics with women because men could be uncomfortable with that too.

So I assume you have no problem with the ""examples of unacceptable behavior"" after all? Because it doesn't make that about identity either.

This *is* relevant, though -- yes, men could be uncomfortable too (as I said), but there is an extreme imbalance in the number of female programmers, and when you ask women why they got out of tech, they often point to stuff like this. And those slides were pretty much exclusively full of sexualized women.

&gt; You cannot separate Ada from her project, and it has nothing to do with meritocracy which is about contributions in this context.

&gt; If I start a movement on ""proper naming conventions in the medical field"", and it was things like changing ""fetuses"" to ""unborn children"" there would of course be outrage.

Of course there would, but if your movement then produced a document in support of the First Amendment and against the TSA, I wouldn't assume the document itself was infected with your views on abortion. Even if you had a document about ""respecting all life"", I might be cynical about your motivations, but unless you went on to demand that we all respect unborn life as well, I don't think I'd see a problem.

You never said what you thought of the Wagner piece, and I'm really curious, because I think it's relevant here.

&gt; It doesn't take that many people, and you saying they're a minority is something I agree on. A small minority of people can cause a ruckus though. That's how extremists work, they're not large groups, but they're still effective.

I don't think I'm getting through to you just how small a group this is. Is ten people enough of a mob to be concerned about? Maybe five? Because you linked to fewer than that!"

"""Clunky"" is *precisely* the right word for how I felt about Cleric Stance.

I can't think of any other skill in the game which is that catastrophic if you double tap it (the worst I can think of is tank stances, and you're not going to be hitting those at tense moments). And with how unresponsive oGCDs in general are, I'm *going* to double tap stuff. Maybe that's just because of my latency as an international player. But I think it's poor design from a user control standpoint. Adding a short cooldown would have helped there, yes.

There's also the fact that, if you just want to stick in a Tetra/Lustrate/ED in the middle of your DPS, Cleric Stance turns it into a triple-weave. Gross.

And the 5s cooldown made healing GCD &gt; attacking GCD &gt; healing GCD impossible, so if you knew you'd need two healing GCDs in close proximity you'd have to just... stop and wait.

That feels clunky.

I'm with u/ssalp. Fluidity over complexity. Healing ‚Äî and specifically healer DPS, that thing we're all trying to encourage people to do ‚Äî is a lot more fun now.

It‚Äôs perfectly fine to be a believer in this case, now they don‚Äôt have GOOD reason to believe but they have sufficient reasons which you can‚Äôt argue with

A typical nonbeliever jet packer will say ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt know because I haven‚Äôt seen compelling proof either way‚Äù

And a toxic believer will say ‚Äúthis manual called ‚Äòwhy jet packs cause cancer‚Äô is infallible and everyone who disagrees is a shill.‚Äù Which is also clearly nonsense. Some may even take it further and say ‚Äúanyone who reads a DIFFERENT book about cancer jet packs is also a shill‚Äù

So as you can see it‚Äôs perfectly fine to believe or not believe but you have to have a reason for both otherwise you just sound like an argumentative asshole. I have no problem with someone believing or not. You can‚Äôt judge anyone‚Äôs personal opinion, but if their reason is stupid please ridicule them"

"Probably the simplest way to do it would be to build the A-frame like you've indicated, only make it about 5-6 feet tall.  Then, instead of a cross member at the top, you have another U-shaped piece connected to the frame using a good, sturdy bolt or pin so that it pivots around the bolt.  The U-shaped section is folded down for storage, and folded up for use and held in place with a second pin on either side.  You could get easily 10-11 feet maximum height when extended for use and have it fold down short enough to fit through any doorway..  "

The problem is that a lot of Chopper's best feats can't really be shown, he treated a giant 80KM elephant's legs from cannon fire - something that's probably never been done in the history of the OP world. And he always fixes up Luffy after battles, including the massive hole that he got gored out of his chest by Katakuri, hell there's not even a scratch after Chopper fixes him up!

"&gt;We have ACC which will look after her - medical costs, time off work, etc. which means that you can't/won't have to take any civil legal action

Well, you can't seek compensatory damages because of the Accident Compensation Act, but ACC is like any insurance company and will try to pay as little as possible, or nothing, if they can get away with it.

Having lived in countries (as a kiwi expat) where you're individually responsible for compensating for injuries you cause, I've noticed a few of differences compared to NZ.

1. Everybody is insured.
2. Drivers try very hard to steer clear of cyclists and pedestrians.
3. If anyone is clearly at fault, then they (and their insurance company) will be super nice to you. Nice hospital, gifts, meal delivery to your home once out of hospital, etc. Anything to avoid it going to court if they know they will lose. (first hand on the receiving side of that)

I know there are downsides, scammers, etc. I used to think that NZ had the best system with ACC, but lately I'm undecided. Wouldn't call either way clearly better based on my own experience."

"Thank you! This month i struggled a bit with KOG, had a rank-up match 3 times with BEWD but always fell down to leg1 afterwards. Just climbed back to leg2 and needed a break so i read your post. I‚Äòll always like geargia bcs I got my first ever KOG with them - but never after until just now. Used the same decklist like you but imo needle ceiling is more often a brick than anything (even though it won me 1 game) i changed it for the spell absorbing life. Went to legend3 in 5 wins straight and from there it took me like 15 games for kog. Going first with ties + spell absorbing life is just so devastating that i thought about trading some canadia for it but then i didn‚Äòt bcs the defensive ability of canadia saved my ass more often.
Matchups were:
About 5 masked heroes - won all of them (like you said they can‚Äòt handle the deck. Everytime i used pulse mines they mask changed i to anki lol)
About 5 BEWD - lost one, the others were easy even without ties. SRH is very good, also pulse mines (and some also used silvers cry after pulse mines lol)
About 3 vampires - won all (easily), canadia grace and pop kingdom with attacker next turn.
2 UA - lost both: i bricked - they didn‚Äòt
2 yubel - lost both: had everything to win but misplayed
Honorable mention:
1 geargia player. I went first with a dream hand. 1 monster, ties, spell absorbing live, pulse mines. Set up board, he did too, i activated spell absorbing life, he surrendered.
1 amazonness player. The deck is dead. It‚Äòs that simple.
1 burn player. I hate you. Went first using ties, you summon lava golem and use jade whistle, i loose."

* Prof at an R1 university

* Community college prof

* Soft money researcher (unpaid title at one of the above, your salary comes from grants that you apply for and pay yourself out of)
* Industry (e.g., biomed, engineering)
* Wall Street (they hire lots of engineers and physicists to do the math)
* K-12 teacher
* Museum work (e.g., Neil deGrasse Tyson)
* Advertising companies
* Military work
* Polling companies
* (edit) Publishing companies hire content experts for things like editing textbooks, creating solution manuals, making slides for professors, creating online HW systems, and so on.

Definitely ask your professors too, as they‚Äôll be able to think of more in your specific field, and they may be able to put you in touch with alumni doing these jobs.  "

"The ""chain"" only goes so far before police involvement is necessary. You'd be amazed how many educators actually aren't trained on how to handle SPED children, much less in dangerous situations or situations in which restraint is warranted. Many TA's are still in college, are uncertified altogether, etc. Many SPED teachers did nothing more than take a quick SPED test and actually had no classes or training. 

A lot of the time, district police are probably the better option for handling severe outbursts because part of the reason they exist is to stop such outbursts. They are trained and experienced in doing so. 

You'd also be amazed at how many districts keep an officer on every campus for the duration of the school day, especially in middle and high school settings where situations are much more severe. 

Calling the police and filing a report does NOT mean your child is going to jail or facing life-long criminal charges. The police are not bad guys, and people really need to realize that a bit more. Their job is to maintain a peaceful community, not to brutalize SPED children. "

"&gt; People start businesses because there is a demand for a good or service, not based on the cost of the input. 

You're not paying attention to what I'm saying. This has little to do with the cost of the input. It has to do with the cost of the output. People start businesses to *sell things*, to fill that demand. If the future price of that good or service is going down, then the rate of return on an investment to fill that demand goes down.

&gt;BUT, though the stock remains at $100 nominally speaking, it too is now worth $101 in real terms when I sell it.

Except it is not going to remain at $100 nominally speaking in a deflationary regime. You, again, are not paying attention. It remains at $100 *real* value, not *nominal* value. If deflation somehow occurred while all securities stayed the same price, then yeah, it'd be awesome. That's not what happens. You've again failed to understand that the problem is the price of what I can sell at the *end* of the investment.

&gt;Once again there is...

You didn't even attempt to respond to the point about laying people off because of reduced revenues - unsurprising, since in general you're not paying attention to the point that it's the expectation of lower future sales that make deflation a problem. As for the rest of it, business expansion and investment does need to be driven by real growth - the problem is that investment occurs *now* and the return from that investment occurs *in the future*. 

Deflation, ceteris paribus, hurts the rate of return of *every investment*. Which means that some marginal but profitable investments are now not profitable, which means they're not going to make those investments, which hurts growth, which exacerbates deflation.

&gt; It isn't because of dreaded deflation, but excessive low-interest rate, debt-driven asset appreciation that has shot rents to astronomical levels. NO ONE CAN AFFORD THE RENT as if the risks of running a business.

Oh absolutely, this is why New York City is a dead zone with no business while very-low-rent places like Detroit are doing gangbusters. Nobody goes to New York anymore, it's too crowded. "

"Here's a theory I have. Just bear with me here.

James wasn't the only Whisperer to abandon the group. Multiple Whisperers disapproved of Alpha and Beta's violent ways and left together. They formed their own group of more passive Whisperers.

THIS is the group that the Raiders are at war with. Something happened between them, and the Raiders started attacking. James is upset because he has to watch his friends resort to violence, maiming and killing the Raiders that attack them, which he feels renders the whole point of branching off from the rest of the Whisperers moot. 

So, James decides to find a way to get the Raiders out of the picture so that the group doesn't have to keep acting violently. He does some spying, learns that the Raiders take kids, and happens to be spying on Abel and Lily when Clem and AJ come across them. You know what happens from there.

James tells Clem about the Raiders taking kids and helps her get back to Ericson so that she can warn them, in the hopes that Ericson will go to war with the Raiders and distract them long enough for his group to leave the area. He didn't tell Clem the truth because, understandably, he didn't think she'd react well to him basically saying ""Hey, can you go fight these guys so that we don't have to?"" "

I think it's really to deter the asshole with an attitude problem who pulls a gun in a heat of the moment situation when it's completely unnecessary.

I'm personally far more afraid of running into people like George Zimmerman, Michael Dunn, Michael Drejka, and Curtis Reeves than I am of running into a mass shooter.

Avg no goal first 10 min +120

Avg over 1.5 -150
Avg under 1.5 +140

I threw out all games that lines were between -150 and -180 because it was way too inconsistent 

I broke it down to two categories 
Each example is if you spent $100 on each bet 

Game PK to -150

Goal first 10 min

+$1,150

Over 1.5 first period 
62%
+$510

If you place both bets on them

54%

Games -180 and up

No goal first 10 min
55%

Under 1.5 first period
55%

If you place it in every game -180 up

"I think it's just difficult to get *any* kind of comment from readers.

At the same time, some readers give 'critique' or pretend something's concrit when it's really not ('you should've done this OTHER ship with the story!' ugh.), without it being requested by the author. Some people are just there for fun, so critique is definitely a thing that's been discouraged for some. 

Finding a group of writers in the fanfic community is another option. They might be more willing to give concrit than readers, as well as helping get stories out to a wider audience."

"Guys can I please, please get a talk through on the following Niacinamide toner recipe:

&amp;#x200B;

10% Niacinamide

5% Licorice Root Extract

3% NAG

2% Glycerin (the Licorice Root extract is in a base of Glycerin, as well, so I don't know if this is too much.)

79.5% Distilled water

0.5% Liquid Germall Plus

&amp;#x200B;

I believe everything is incorporated in the heat phase except for NAG and Liquid Germall Plus. But is everything heated up all together? Do I heat the water first then add the other heated ingredients one by one? And if so, in what order? I really don't want to spend on a double boiler right now so what can I use? To what temperature do I heat it to and for how long?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a gram scale, 1 mL syringes, and a pH meter but I believe I need a thermometer.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I still measure the liquid things (water, Glycerin) on the gram scale or can I use my mL syringes?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware 10% Niacinamide is not usually recommended, but I've been using 10% Niacinamide serums with no problems and great results.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I use as a pH adjuster to bring it to 6?

&amp;#x200B;

Also I want it to be very lightweight, pretty much waterweight and not sticky. Are there any red flags in my recipe in regards to the texture I'm looking for?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much! You guys are amazing and I've already learned so much lurking."

The girls on stage didn't look sexy, they looked **bored**.

The older man near the stage just looked at her.  No emotion showing.  Dead eyes. Kind of slumping posture.  A bit creepy and maybe sad.  It was rather empty, so maybe we went at not peak hours and got the regulars for that time."

"It needs to generate a sound at a specific frequency to make [a standing sound wave in a pipe](http://hep.physics.indiana.edu/~rickv/Standing_Sound_Waves.html), so I'm having a feedback loop where it first calculates the frequency based on the length of the pipe and `c = fŒª`, then it tests frequencies in a 2-3Hz range around that frequency, testing the volume of the sound via microphone. It'll figure out which precise frequency produces the loudest standing sound wave and then record the decibel value from that loudest frequency. This repeats for 4 more trials at different harmonics.

TLDR, no I can't use a sound file because I have to generate precise frequencies, perhaps down to .01Hz. I'd use pygame for a non-blocking sound file."

"I'll deal with the pain, hurt, and reality and move on as I have a million times before.

Those who use a way that is fast-healing and effective (such as confronting and dealing with the issue), usually become strong and successful individuals. Those who use a self-destructing and ineffective way (such as abusing drugs), usually become the complete opposite.

I've reached that age and experience level far long ago (even though I'm not that old lol). I'm actually a successful entrepreneur who has achieved more than most. I wasn't born with a silver spoon, so you can only imagine what I've been through and how many times I've failed in order to be the success I am today.

"Starch Lord: The card itself is fine, it's held back by roots being impossible to build a deck around at present. The correct solution, instead of making it absolutely ridiculous by making it be an on curve 3 drop, is to just give roots some more synergy so they're worth playing, because starch lord itself is not the problem.

Briar: Fine, better if it just said other flowers, but 5 cost is fine too.

Swash: Snowball cards don't get on curve stats for a reason. This makes the card no-risk, high reward, and that is not a good idea. There's a reason why the card only has 2 health.

Medulla: First of all, just because zombie ramp isn't disgustingly broken anymore doesn't mean it's dead. Second, this card was nerfed for a reason. Fusion and evolution absolutely break this card in half, and I'm glad we never got to see it at 3 brains with the former, because the latter was enough to be completely insane. Back in set 2 this was fine, nowadays it would be complete and total insanity to have it in this state.

Marine Bean: You have created a 2 cost 4/3 amphibious. That is all I have to say on that matter.

Laser Cattail: More removing the risk from balanced snowball cards and making them ridiculous. Combo with any number of one mana amphibious cards to get your 2 cost 3/3 amphib today. Or combine it with the ridiculous change you made to marine bean and for 4 mana get a 3/3 and a 6/3, and if they remove the bigger one the smaller one gets to grow more.

Zombot 1000: The problem this card has is that the timing is bad for the effect. The problem this change has is that the timing is ridiculous for the effect and wins the game on the spot, something that cards do not do in this game. It's a terrible card right now, but simply removing the only downside from the ability is not the fix.

Ra Zombie: This would just be completely asinine, you develop a 3/4 while literally preventing your opponent from playing anything beyond turn 2. That's both unfun and stupidly overpowered. There's a reason why ra zombie hasn't gotten buffed, and it's not an accident.

Pod Fighter: So now instead of a finisher that requires setup, it's just a completely broken tempo card. Not sure I'd call that an improvement.

Metal Petal Sunflower: Main problem here is that armored is out of class, but at least this one isn't a balance problem like most of the other ones.

Zookeeper: There is a reason why his stats are bad and he's not a one cost, and that's so he doesn't snowball incredibly easily and combo for free. This completely ignores that in favor of oce again removing all setup that keeps snowballing cards balanced and breaking the game.

Headhunter: Yes, the evolution is restricted. That's kinda the point, so you can't just run a 4 cost 5/6 bullseye in anything that remotely swarms. Furthermore, since you're more or less just running dance cards in dance decks, it ONLY helps the abuse case and not the deck it's designed for. Not a good idea."

Logically, no one wants to terminate a pregnancy.  But it happens because of an unwanted, unplanned pregnancy and for whatever reason the person feels that termination is the best option.

"No two signatures are a match, if they match, it's considered an anomaly. I used to work as a teller, then as a banker in commercial and community (branch-based) banking. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the thing we had are digital signature panels, and also what we called signature cards - they are used to cross check a person's signature, with a check presented that might seem suspicious. 

&amp;#x200B;

The easiest way to tell if someone was attempting to forge or present a false check was to see if the signature was an EXACT match, because people would attempt to use a light-table to trace the signature. If the signature was an exact match, I would pull the last 20-30 check images deposited or endorsed. If there was a variation in the person's signature, and no variation in the check or document presented before me, that prompted an immediate flag by me in the system, and in some cases if it was a commercial issue, I'd notify security and fraud services for \[the bank.\]"

"Worst as an interviewer:

The guy had been applying for jobs in my department for about 8 years, apparently. He was seasoned, but 8 years beforehand, a young 27 year old woman took the job he applied for (and was never interviewed for). That woman was me. He told me all about this when I interviewed him. I then found out he made a big fuss about where everyone got their degrees if they were from a lesser ranked school than his alma mater. When he got to me, and gave me the lecture about how I got the job he wanted 8 years ago, he THEN asked me where I got my doctorate. Casually, I replied; ""Oh, I went to [insert number 6 school in the country]."" If looks could kill, I'd be dead now. What an ass. 

Worst as an interviewee: 

I went to two schools with terrible interviewing. Saginaw Valley was the worst experience of my life, and I don't care who knows. It was so bad and so unprofessional that MY alma mater put them on a black list so any student who applied knew how terrible they were from my experience. Another school that will remain nameless advertised a tenure track line that would be responsible for making a concentration in my field. No big deal. It was interesting and I was experienced and wanted to get out of my current institution (that is STILL my current institution). Get there, come to find out they changed the position to non-tenure track without letting any of the candidates know. After being offered the job a few days later I basically told them they were crazy to expect anyone to take a serious demotion just to work there, and that they themselves wouldn't do that either. "

"We currently have a role in my department advertised which I'm handling the applications for, so I've been looking at CVs every day this week.

I would suggest using whatever name you commonly go by, or would want someone to refer to you as. The only thing I really need the name for is to know what to say if I call or email back to someone.

This can actually be a bit tricky with Asian names, as I'm sometimes unsure if the person is from a culture where the ""surname"" comes first, and so am unsure which name I should use. With one person whose name was two four letter words ending in ng (I.e. Yang, Wong, Ming, Fang, etc) I didn't know which to go with so I just replied with both.

That's just me not wanting to offend anyone though. No way would I ever filter based on apparent ethnicity from someone's name (though depressingly I'm sure there are people who would). I do definitely look for any issues with English in cover letters, what country someone went to school or uni in, or if they don't have permanent residency.

There's plenty of European people with shitty English on working holiday visas who've applied and gotten cast aside (had their application put into the ""Yeah, nah..."" folder in Outlook).

"This link details the institutional failures that led to the death.   

https://www.foxnews.com/us/ex-official-chances-missed-to-save-boy-encased-in-concrete  

The kid should have been removed from the family on the grounds her livein BF was violent regardless of whether it was to the boy or his mother, it is the same thing from a child protection perspective.    The father and I'd imagine other relatives could have taken him.    

These sort of failures happen all around the world for the same reasons - child protection services are underfunded and underpowered.  Their staff are hugely overloaded so they only spend time on the worst cases.   

Staff retention is poor and not enough suitable people train for the job so they have to take sub-optimal people.    Yet it is very important to have staff who are educated, specifically trained, have the right personal qualities and have years of experience.  

And yet in the comments on the Fox site some people somehow claimed it was because CPS has *too much* power.   The truth is they are severely constrained, they can't move without evidence that will stand up in court, e.g. bruises which can not be explained any other way.   "

"&gt;I can tell you just looked up stats. Caddilac got hurt his sophmore year but played and only played in 5 games Gruden last 2 years. Anything after that is not really relevant. 

And I can tell you're trying to defend Gruden in the face of his shortcomings (i.e. his shitty draft history). In Cadilac's case, whether he played under Gruden is irrelevant here. The point is, his career production doesn't justify where Gruden picked him. And his sophmore ""injury"" wasn't serious enough to keep him off the field. He was playing ""hurt"", not injured. And those are a dime a dozen in the NFL. You're reaching for excuses now. 


&gt;Now let my try to stay on topic here I don't wanna lose you. My reference to being fucked by the salary cap is also tied into drafting. Before the CBA rookies were able to negotiate their deals. Remember Jamarcus.
https://www.pewterreport.com/bucs-salary-cap-hell-is-over/
They didn't get rid of dead cap all the way to 2007. 


Sorry, but you're still off topic. None of what you said addresses Gruden's inability to evaluate young talent. 


&gt;Just because those are the only names you can remember doesn't mean that's the only relevant names. Ruud seemed pretty good. Gaines Adams was also on the all rookie team and really only had 3 years in league before passing. 

Just because you want to retroactively pump up their abilities to defend Gruden, doesn't mean they were actually any good. Fact: On Gruden's watch, the Bucs only drafted 2 guys worth mentioning. Otherwise he would've done better than 22-26 his final 3 years"

&gt; This page is a composite of music from two bands I've been in, Bled On Waves (early/mid 1990s grunge era Omaha band) and Makanak (2000 era electronic/punk mashup, or something), and a few solo demo things I've done by myself.  The first two tracks, Kground and Machine, are Bled On Waves (featuring myself, Heith Jensen, Corey Ketchmark, Mark Rosenthal)--I co wrote and sing on both, Heith plays guitars, Corey handles bass, Mark=drums).  Dead Air, FTWAR, For Dingman, Dipped and Deep Blue Dunes are all Makanak, which consisted of myself on guitar and vocals, Dale Laushman on synths and programming, both of us on additional precussion and Ed Schroeder on trumpet.  Big Pretty, Real Life and All Wrapped Up are all me, for better or for worse.  I may put up a few more tracks at a later date.  Enjoy! Read more on Last.fm.

"You're not alone, man. I dealt with the same issues for many years after buzzing and shaving my head. 

Full disclosure, the product I'm recommending is from my company, Comprehensive Cranium Care. I started this line of grooming products precisely because I couldn't find something decent for bald and buzzed heads. Our signature product is a daily cleanser that won't dry out your skin. The acne could be a result of your scalp over-producing oil because it's too dry. Check out our Head Wash at [www.cranium.care](http://www.cranium.care/) or on Amazon (we're doing a sale on Amazon right now)."

"Lol, it's like he has this vague understanding that Seattle is a focused running team and that that's good enough justification for going after someone like McCoy without having actually really paying attention to this team at all this year.

Penny alone was a reach because the coaches felt Carson and Davis were still question marks at the time. That's no longer the case, so now McCoy would have to heads, shoulders, knees, and toes above all three of them to justify another, even more ill advised pick up. He's good, but not that good. Plus, he'd have to somehow supplant Prosise, and that dude has titanium grade job security for some reason."

"These recent AMAs have made me wonder about something. With the kind of public presence and interaction you have with your fans, you create a imbalanced sense of familiarity between yourself and us, your fans - we often feel like we know you well (or at least know much about you), while you, for the most part, don't know us beyond the few words we exchange at events. With this in mind, have you had to change the way you interact with people, online and off - and if so, how?"

"Someone put it right here and I'm trying to remember it.

It was essentially that you believe and support the victim. And that the accused is innocent until proven guilty. The secret to why that's not contradictory is because they refer to entirely different phases in the process. 

When the victim is reporting, you must treat the allegations with utter seriousness and not belittle or intimidate them. When that allegation turns into a case, the accused must be assumed to be innocent until proven guilty.

I'm not doing this as elegantly as the individual in question said it, but that's the gist. "

The video was leaked on the morning of the same day that Fran√ßa and Doria had a debate at night on the television

Although this indications, with don't know the origin and who made the video. Doria is blaming Fran√ßa. I guess that unfortunately, we will never know

For me, the most important question is if the video will negatively impact Doria campaign or franca campaign. If the answer is the first one It will prove that this kind of ‚Äùtool‚Äù (even if proven that is fake) is a good resource"

"Yeah, that opening scene was good for setting the mood for both Little Forest movies, so I see your point. Still should have been listed though.

I agree, Mayu Matsuoka was amazing in that movie. I just wish the male lead (her co-worker, not the guy she was fantasizing about) was as handsome as she is adorable.

What are your favorite teen/high school/manga adaptation movies? Mine's probably From Me to You; Mikako Tabe nailed her character perfectly, I think, even if the love-story aspect of the plot felt kinda rushed."

"Torb could always 1v1 any hero. He used to be able to start a fight with 275 HP and 300 HP self heals on demand with no cool down. He is squishier now than he was before. 

Wan't to beat Torb? Kill his turrets during poke to force the 13 second penalty CD. Force his Overload and kite. I haven't lost a single game to Torb 2.0 in comp. I have been avoiding Torb players in hopes I get them again.

The people who think Torb 2.0 is aren't people who played Torb 1.0. Almost every Torb 1.0 player I know hates him now."

"Thanks, but I'm very much a novice here.  I suspect local codes do not look very favorably on floating slab foundations in most of the US (either simple concrete pours or complex modern methods), generally they require getting below the frostline - http://www.hammerpedia.com/frost-line-map/ and using stem walls below any major load-bearing elements.  Foundations (these can be floors, crawlspaces, or basements depending on depth) are placed over aggregate, which is often gravity-drained using piping, by grading, or if gravity doesn't work by a sump system.  If slabs don't work, we pull out the concrete piers which are constructed similarly (or occasionally concrete piers with tens-of-meters-deep metal anchoring).

Lots of homes in the American South are both warm enough to not have to worry about seasonal frost, and have a high enough water table &amp; flat enough land that they can't have practical basements, so they end up with slab-on-grade foundations, but this is a regional thing."

""Hours and schedule may vary. Ability to work outside regular business hours as required for projects and ‚Äúon-call.‚Äù""

"I like Gears well enough, and honestly you could reasonably compare the Gears games to the first three God of War games. But anyone in their right mind knows that the statement that ANY Gears game is better than God of War 2018 is a fucking joke. And in my opinion, the level of quality isn't even REMOTELY comparable. I bet you could ask this in the fucking Xbox sub and get the same responses. It's such a ridiculous claim that its given me a brain hemorrhage just by trying to reason how someone could claim it beyond sheer jealousy."
"Kava can cause psychological dependence (addiction) in susceptible people, and it seems that more often than not these people are ex-alcoholics or benzo users. However, it seems to be very infrequently associated with physical dependence (and associated w/d expected of a GABAergic like anxiety) to the point that I question whether supposed withdrawals are just a bad reaction to kava itself or a psychological adjustment to life without kava. In any case, it can be dependence forming mentally, but it seems to be far less prone to forming physical dependence (or any sort of w/d symptoms at all) than kratom is. The main reason I say to be careful is that it‚Äôs possible to get mentally ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on kava just as someone can get mentally ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on ice cream or salty food, so moderation is the name of the game. Also make sure you only buy from a reputable dealer with certified noble kava."

It's not possible for us to properly identify this from a picture or description and it would be irresponsible to try. This is because many drugs look alike (e.g. 99% of synthetic drugs are white powders).

Less common substances will require analytical testing, provided by the likes of [**these organisations**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/wiki/knowledgebase#wiki_laboratory_analysis).

"The frequency with which you cast BT is only slightly higher than the frequency that you cast mangle. Every other finisher instead of every finisher.

The largest difference is that it is a global that heals you instead of does a very minor amount of damage. 

In practicality its about the same. Casting the heal on anything but yourself is really only a thing in PvP. Otherwise its just something you cast on yourself (nobody uses it elsewhere).

Guilty isn't wrong. The largest advantage Boomies have is their range. However this is only in a vaccum. 

Treants are great. Which I would say is the largest disparity outside of the range. Because of how Armor works with Agi however Feral is far more viable to actually taunt a bigger add or Boss (which Boomkin cannot do)

However the disparity between interrupts is explained by the long CD on it. Triple ranged comps struggle on pulls. 

The larger issue is that when building a comp, Feral relative to other Melee doesn't bring enough. When combined with current tuning, while you're building a comp you'd rather bring a different melee and wait for a different ranged.

It doesn't bring enough to overcome the ranged advantage when people are trying to put a group together. Especially because of how the melee landscape works."

"&gt;But on the other hand not. Because blocking exists. You can clearly cut all ways the person has to communicate with you.

Yes, and you can also block a phone number. It's a solution for the individual, but it doesn't address the root issue, and it doesn't make it not ""harrassment"" by the above definition.

&gt;Not in this definition is: I don't like that other people can see it.

I don't know what this means.

&gt;It still rests on proving harassment, people who skip that are doodoos.

""Proving"" ""harrassment"" is not a real thing, because ""harrassment"" is not objective. There are four different definitions of harrassment provided in the link I supplied above, and Reddit uses a fifth. You could parse apart which definitions this fits and which it doesn't, but this is a semantics game with no substance beyond the consequences associated with a given definition.

&gt;the structure doesn't owe you compensation or attention if you can't prove it by the structures standards. Unfortunate, but a necessary concession when in a situation where an authority makes rules and a class has to follow them.

Of course.

   your exchange needs to have a method of holding and securing fiat. That's not really important to their business or to you. Now said exchanges only need to be able to bridge and move fiat to serve their customers.

   volatility poses a problem for moving crypto - you have to move it in a state where it's ""real"" value (to your life, your balance sheet) is changing uncomfortably.

   you have different accounting/tracking/securing/transfering systems for fiat and for crypto. By wrapping fiat in crypto you unify the systems you need to have for all currencies. Simple = better.

   To move money in and out of coinbase in fiat there is gonna be a fee somewhere for someone and they are too high. That sucks.

Here, take a piece of my gaming story and lemme hope that it helps me in winning the game.

I was playing Saints Row: The Third with a friend. We were fending off cops, and after some time we got on a VTOL. We entered the VTOL, but then we had to parachute away because of the plane waiting to blow up. I managed to parachute into the penthouse, but he did a EPIC FAIL in parachuting, and slammed, face in the ground, into the penthouse's heliport's green ""ground"". He managed to again parachute safely into the ground, but he wasn't immortal, like I was, in the game, and only had the ""basics"": dildo, Deagles, RPGs and AK-47s were just some of them. So he clearly could hold position and give me cover fire. I yet again arrived with a military chopper, but now he was running out of ammo. It was a ""GET TO THE CHOPPA"" moment. But we weren't going to escape so easily: He somehow managed to piss off the Morningstar gang, a nearly impossible fact, due to the fact that by the time military tanks and SWAT choppers are trying to anihillate us, pedestrians and gang enemies were pratically inexistent.

Now, we had gang choppers on us. Maybe he was near a, outpost, I think. That's the only way the gang could be so pissed off.

But, to what matters. We entered the chopper (a SWAT Tornado, by the way), just to be yet again blown up. We jumped out of the chopper, we were so high that if we piloted the plane to the Syndicate Tower, only pushing the analog foward, I wouldn't crash but instead be able to land it there. We jumped, but guess what?

We parachuted, each one on the top of the choppers. On the window. [This video is a good example of that,at 3:19 in the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prgsQm7VE6s)

My friend got a free SWAT chopper, and I? A fun story to tell.

Now that I ended the story, I can finish posting.

"Heres how my offseasons plans out

Trout extension 

Eovaldi

Maldonado

Trade Calhoun for a reliever if possible otherwise keep him

Fletcher utility/ Cozart 2nd

Ward 3b

During the opening ceremony on Opening Day, the flames go off in right field and Mike Scioscia runs in from the bullpen with a steel chair and the crowd goes nuts. He hits Ausmus with the chair and drops him right on the pitchers mound. Ausmus miraculously gets up and attempts to lock Scioscia into a grapple but Mike Trout comes out of nowhere and hits Ausmus with a stunner. The camera pans to Mickey Hatcher cruising in a bullpen cart full of beer onto the field and him, Trout, and Scioscia clash beers and chug. 

Angel's defeat Rangers 5-4 and Ausmus is fired. Mike Scioscia returns as manager.

"I just don't get that shit. I love all cars *because* they aren't all the same thing. If every engine were a V8 that would be *boring*. Lil cars with weaker engines are cool because they don't serve the same purpose as bigger cars. I mean, it's not like they were trying to make a V6 and just fucked up so it came out as a straight 4. Variety is the spice, every car is distinguished by every other car. Also l, I get that acceleration is cool and everything, but even a lil 4 banger is gonna rip your fingers off if you grab the flywheel while it's running. All cars are engineering achievements, and all engines are stronger than we can really grasp as humans."

"You're missing the point. You don't have a right to fixed infrastructure. You don't have a right to eat. If there is no food, God is not going to reach down from heaven and make sure you have a steak. Are you following me? 

If we collapse our financial system then we will not have food. We will have more poor on the street doing bad things because they are badly hungry. We will not have money for LRT, or health care, or police, or anything. There are real world examples of what happens. This is a big problem. 

Your solution is to kick the can down the road. But the problem with that is the problem becomes more dire and the solution becomes more impossible until, inevitably, there is mass suffering. Look at how rich Canada was in the 70s. Look at us now. What will we be like in another 50 years on this road? 

&amp;#x200B;

There is no point in us having any conversation if we cannot at least agree on one thing: That Ontario cannot perpetually go into debt without consequence. 

Then we really need to come to grips with what are the consequences of running out of money -- or to put it more realistically, we've already ran out of money -- what happens when we run out of credit and the devil comes to collect his dues? 

&amp;#x200B;

If you really want to get into your analogy about a guy with a lot of credit card debt then to make sense of the situation so that we can find a solution we must first understand how he got that much debt. If he's working and he's piling up credit card debt then obviously buying the bus pass isn't really a long term solution, is it? He's going to get more and more debt until they cut him off and then he's going to be in big trouble. 

The solution is for him to cut his expenses and/or increase his income. You cannot solve his problem with a bus pass. There's no point even looking at that as a solution. And if we really want to be realistic about this, he isn't buying a bus pass...he's buying a bus."
"&gt; Ok but WalMart can only keep up the market power button keeping prices low.

Once they've wiped out the competition they no longer need to keep the prices low. 

&gt; You're flipping the script. Walmart's low prices are the result of competition

Just as drug dealers shooting each other is the result of competition. That doesn't make it a good thing. 

&gt; you can't then look and say that competition isn't a result Walmart's low prices, therefore something is wrong.

I, and every economist under the sun can and will cite Walmart's practices as anti-competitive and bad for consumers. There have been entire books written about this. There is even a movie **Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price**. This isn't news -- it is history. We know that Walmart is bad for the economy, bad for small businesses, and bad for consumers.

Funny because my historical research and classes have told me that opinions are souring on whether the New Deal did anything to aid recovery (or may have even hindered recovery) from the Great Depression. Maybe your social reasons are valid but I really don't see any evidence of the socialist presence you seem to suggest is existing in any sizable form OTL. Socialists existed but they were by no means a major threat that the New Deal somehow prevented.

"American eagle is great for jeans and khakis. (I like their straight or slim-straight jeans) Also their drawstring shorts are comfortable and super adjustable. Go into the store and try stuff out. But try and get your measurements first so you‚Äôre not lost when you get to the wall of pants. That way you can take advantage of online sales or order something that‚Äôs not in stock. 
If you need to get them tailored (I do and highly *highly* recommend it) make sure the waist and butt and thighs fit. You can always hem (shorten) or slim the legs but it‚Äôs difficult and expensive to change stuff higher up. 

H&amp;M is good for shirts (keep an eye put for sales and avoid low quality/thin shirts). Also local thrift stores have a lot of different brands so it‚Äôs a good idea to try out a few different shirts from your general size range. 
Also getting inexpensive clothes when figuring out your style/how to pass will save you so much money. 

American Eagle also has smaller sized shirts that I like but are more expensive than H&amp;M. Again try on as much stuff as you can in the store. Also write down your sizing for stuff that fits so you‚Äôll remember and be able to compare. 

I also have had good luck with the Carbon brand from Rue21 for pants, super stretchy material and good sizing for wider hips. 

Good luck!"
