It‚Äôs basic psychology. Your going to complain about something more than you‚Äôll praise something.

"1. You are incorrect the vast majority of mental illness does not present in this way. In fact individuals suffering from mental illness are more likely to harm themselves than other.

2. Just because some acts inappropriately does not mean they are mentally ill.

3. You are not a mental health professional do not assume things about the field you aren't researched in.

4. Just because someone gets treatment doesn't mean they are magically fixed and will never ever be symptomatic again.

5. You are actually very wrong about that last statement because your scope of mental illness is too small. Many mental illnesses go very unnoticed for long periods of time. The average person who experiences a mental illness takes 7-10 years to get treatment. This is due to the underlying stigma regarding it. That stigma being that you have to be acting out, aggressive, or suicidal to be mentally ill, which actually is a very very small portion of mental illness.

I get it, there is a lot of misinformation out there. It is hard to know what is real and what isnt, but acting as if you know anything at all about it besides your personal experience with it is hurtful to the community. Also, last point, actually logic and mental illness do mix very well in fact. The whole point of treatment is to find a way for someone to be able to see the logical answers and responses to whatever they may be suffering from and only the severe cases are hard to logically explain the solution to.

In summary, you are probably a concerned citizen, and would be more than helpful and kind to anyone around you. However, the stigma created by the media portrays the mentally I'll as violent, cruel, or dangerous individuals when in fact they are more likely to be the victim of a violent crime. By speaking in the manner you are and the way this post is portrayed furthers that stigma that those with mental illness are bad people that need to be avoided. It's not about treated versus untreated. It's about the fact that the only time we are able to get the spotlight is when one of us is violent or acts extremely irrationally. Not all of us are violent, not all of us mutter to ourselves, are suicidal, homicidal, psychotic. The vast majority of us suffer in silence because if we get labeled with a mental illness people are going to expect us to explode even if that isn't what we struggle with."

"Ducati charges you *a lot* to put their name on both sides of your gas tank and then skimps on the build quality. 

I was considering replacing my Aprilia Shiver (~$9k bike) with a Ducati Monster 1200S (~$15k bike) until I noticed that Ducati skimped on things like steel braided brake lines, quality brake and clutch fluid reservoirs on the handlebars, quality mirrors, and neglected to build the passenger pegs in such a manner that they wouldn‚Äôt rattle - all items crafted meticulously on my older and 33% less expensive Aprilia. The Ducati‚Äôs fare even worse on a model to model comparison (Tuono Factory to Monster 1200R). 

The Ducati‚Äôs are beautifully made bikes from afar and a little cheesy when you get up close on them.

KTM is even worse in this accord. "

"You may forget about the cultural values and follow the early Christians.

The early Christians who followed the teachings of Jesus were true Christians.

They did not worship Jesus as God because the concept of trinity was not yet defined by the church fathers.

Jesus did not claim to be a God, he did not ask the disciples to worship him as a God, he asked them to pray to the only true God (his God and their God).

When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of Trinity; they have added verses like **1 John 5:7**

‚ÄúFor there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one‚Äù

**The bible footnotes explain that verse 1 John 5:7 was not in the original old scriptures.**

Jesus referred to himself as ‚Äúson of man‚Äù. Jesus was not all-knowledgeable and he prayed to GOD, so this is enough to say that he wasn‚Äôt God nor did God come down to earth to be Jesus.

Jesus said, ‚ÄúAnd this is life eternal, that they might know You ***the only true God***, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.‚Äù John 17:3

Jesus said that he does not know everything; he said that only God knows

But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father Mark 13:32

Jesus said that he is not equal to God

‚ÄúI can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.‚Äù John 5:30

Jesus said, ‚ÄúThe Father is greater than I.‚Äù John 14:28

‚ÄúJesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.‚Äù John 7:16

Jesus prayed to God as written in Mark 1:35, Luke 5:16, John 17:11, Matthew 26:39, Luke 10:21, Luke 22:44

‚Äúmy Father and your Father; my God and your God‚Äù John 20:17

The disciples did not pray to Jesus, they prayed to the God and Father of Jesus

‚ÄúBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ‚Ä¶‚Äù 1 Peter 1:3

Jesus introduced himself as a Prophet and people accepted him as a prophet, not as a God in Matthew 13:57, John 9:17, Matthew 21:11, Luke 7:16, Luke 24:19, John 6:14, Matthew 14:5, Matthew 21:46, John 7:40-41, and in Matthew 24:36

Jesus never said I am God; In the Old Testimony God says he is God several times, but Jesus did not say so in the New Testimony

Isaiah 45:5 and 46:9 ‚Äòno God beside me‚Äô, ‚Äònone like me‚Äô

In John 17:6-8 and John 13:3 Jesus explained that God has given power and authority, he did not own it

John 12:49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say

John 14:24 Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me

In Matthew 19:16-17 and Luke 18:19 Jesus denied being good in the sense that God is good.

‚ÄòWhy do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.‚Äô

Jesus is called a ‚ÄúMan‚Äù many times in the Bible of John 8:40, Acts 17:31  
  ‚Äòa man who has told you the truth‚Äô

The disciples have introduced Jesus as a ‚ÄúMan‚Äù in Acts 2:22 and Acts 2:23

According to the teachings of all prophets, salvation is based on obedience, repentance, and forgiving others - if we forgive people, God will forgive us.

No sacrifice is necessary for salvation.

No bloodshed is necessary for salvation.

No savior should die for the salvation of others; everyone is responsible for his own salvation.

Jesus has also confirmed the same in Matthew 18:21-35, 6:14-15, Mark 11:25-26, and Luke 6:36-37

The only exceptions are the distorted teachings of Paul who taught that Jesus death was necessary for forgiveness of sins in [1 Corinthians 15:3](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/1-Corinthians/15/3), [Romans 5:6-10 ](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Romans/5/8), [Romans 4:25](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Romans/4/25)

The teachings of Atonement were taught by Paul in [Ephesians 1:7](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Ephesians/1/7), [Colossians 1:13-14](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Colossians/1/13), [1 Corinthians 15:3](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/1-Corinthians/15/3), [Romans 4:25](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Romans/4/25), [Galatians 1:4](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Galatians/1/4), [1 Corinthians 5:7](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/1-Corinthians/5/7), [Ephesians 5:2](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Ephesians/5/2), [Ephesians 1:7](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Ephesians/1/7), [Colossians 1:13-14](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Colossians/1/13)

When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of Atonement they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost

The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures

Hebrews 9:22 ‚Äúwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness‚Äù is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:11 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who do not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health

The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers

Proverbs 16:6 teaches that ‚ÄúIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.‚Äù

Psalm 69:30-31 teach that praise worship is better than sacrifice

2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without blood sacrifice

‚ÄòIf my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin‚Äô

Jonah 3 teach that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood

Jesus taught the parable of The Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32 to highlight the importance of obedience and repentance as the main prerequisites for salvation

In Luke 13:3 and 13:5, Jesus taught that repentance is necessary for salvation

But unless you repent, you too will all perish

Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one‚Äôs neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices

What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6

‚ÄòFor I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings‚Äô

That verse teaches us that forgiveness is possible by repentance and obedience; no sacrifice is necessary

Matthew 9:13 teaches that Jesus came to call the sinner to repentance

‚ÄòI desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance‚Äô"

"I don't mind this kind of encouragement, so long as it's not actually required or expected. Because: ""Why leave to go have dinner with your family when..."" No, just leave, have dinner with your family. So the real question for me is, if you do that, will people at Google give you shit for it?

Also, for what it's worth:

&gt; A mandated 40 hour work week -- you can work longer if the situation absolutely requires it, but you need to ask for permission.

Sounds like an annoying amount of bureaucracy for something that shouldn't be a problem in the first place. My current job means I work ~30-35h most weeks, 40h is a *maximum* unless something is absolutely on fire. And if ""absolutely on fire"" happens one week a year (and never on the holidays, so far), that's just not a big deal.

&gt; Generous PTO/medical/family leave policies.

Apparently it varies, but e.g. [some employeses have unlimited sick days](https://www.glassdoor.com/Benefits/Google-Sick-Days-US-BNFT33_E9079_N1.htm), combined with [a fair amount of PTO/vacation](https://www.glassdoor.com/Benefits/Google-Vacation-and-Paid-Time-Off-US-BNFT29_E9079_N1.htm). Not as good as what you're describing, certainly not as good as you'd get in Europe, but not bad.

&gt; Fair pay and good benefits.

And Google is kind of famous for these. My favorite example is: For the benefits that apply to spouses, like medical coverage, [they fixed an important gap in health benefits for same-sex couples](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/your-money/01benefits.html):

&gt; On average, employees with domestic partners will pay about $1,069 more a year in taxes than a married employee with the same coverage, according to a 2007 report by M. V. Lee Badgett, director of the Williams Institute, a research group that studies sexual orientation policy issues.

&gt; So Google is essentially going to cover those costs, putting same-sex couples on an even footing with heterosexual employees whose spouses and families receive health benefits.

My point here is, there's a reason Google keeps winning ""best place to work"" awards, and it's not because they somehow trick people into 80-hour work weeks with free food. So I'm assuming the on-site laundry is used by the same people using the on-site gyms/showers, and not primarily by people who just live at the office and never see their families. (Though, to be fair, they did also famously have a guy who parked a box truck in a Google parking lot and lived there, because housing is so damned expensive in the Bay Area.)"

Agreed on the gori girls. Gori girls are rude, entitled, narcisstic and cunts with zero personality. Even for sex they're not all that. I used to focus exclusively on white women a few years ago but got bored and put off. 

Thing with black girls is either they are ghetto or they're top tier. Such black girls rarely date or marry fellow black men.

"I'm not a vet, but [oxygen toxicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity) is a thing, and if there are any weird drug responses or reactions involving oxygen she might be held accountable if there's a documented standard. This might be a consideration to worry about. However, it's very unlikely, and O2 tox requires a *lot* of oxygen, more than ""just a little,"" and it's probably safe.

"**Tom Waits**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/e6928364a1584e76ad63e88df481aafd.png)  

&gt; Tom Waits (born Thomas Alan Waits, in Pomona, California, on December 7, 1949) is a prolific American singer, songwriter, composer, and actor.

&gt; He started his career in the early 1970s as a singer in spit 'n' sawdust bars. Initially, he was deeply influenced by the beat generation, novelists like Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, and poets like Allen Ginsberg and Charles Bukowski.  Waits is often compared to Charles Bukowski, being similar both in content and lifestyle

&gt; Waits was unable to make a living from his music in the 70s because his classical bar music, based in pre-rock, and Americana, blues, and Vaudeville styles were not popular.  Waits's voice back then was soft, warm and clear. 

&gt; Waits subsequently developed a devoted cult following and has influenced subsequent songwriters, despite having little radio or music video support. In fact, his songs are perhaps best known to the general public in the form of cover versions of more visible artists, such as the Eagles, Bruce Springsteen and Rod Stewart. 

&gt; Although Waits‚Äôs albums have met with mixed commercial success in his native United States, they have occasionally achieved gold album sales status in other countries.

&gt; Lyrically, Waits's songs are known for atmospheric portrayals of seedy characters and places; he sings about the losers on the streets: alcoholics, junkies, prostitutes and social outcasts, although he also includes more conventional and touching ballads in his repertoire.  

&gt; While opening for Frank Zappa, the audience catcalled and refused to listen to him; he was an unsuitable match with Zappa's avantgarde style. 

&gt; Countless cigarettes, gallons of alcohol and many  all night parties eventually left their trace in his face and voice.

&gt; His more recent gravelly voice can be first heard on Small Change. This distinctive voice turned out to be his trademark. It is described by the Music Hound Rock Album Guide as sounding ""like it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months and then taken outside and run over with a car"". Small Change with its sentimental ballads, its bar-jazz attitude and Film Noir-oriented stories turned out to be his biggest commercial success in the 1970s. 

&gt; Waits subsequently developed a more unique style. His songs have grown more abrasive since then, and the arrangements have turned more surreal and experimental with every new record.  His life brings him to new visions, as indicated by the direction taken in his ""Alice"" release.

&gt; While composing the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's One From The Heart Waits met Kathleen Brennan, his bride-to-be. They married in 1980 and she helped him quit drinking and smoking.  Since their marriage they have been working together on his albums as co-producers and co-writers. It is hard to say which part belongs to her and which to him, but it's easy to see that they make a perfect team.  Additionally, his eldest son Casey can be heard on turntables and percussion on Waits's album ""Real Gone"".

&gt; One of Waits's greatest successes was the album ""Swordfishtrombones"", released in 1983. It struck with his critics and fans alike. He achieved a new level of song writing and left former conventions (and his earlier career) behind. All songs, whether ballads, jive or jazz are played in a completely different way. It seems that Waits had taken the musical archetypes of these styles and made them his own. All tracks are in the quintessential Waits style. They have a striking rawness and listenability and they set the stage for his success and his future career. 

&gt; The Bad As Me Songfacts reports that 36 years after the release of Waits' first album, Closing Time in 1973, Bad As Me became Waits's first ever top 10 album in the US when it debuted at #6 with 63,000 sales. 

&gt; In the late 1980s Waits discovered an outlet for his creativity in composing musicals. His first Musical was named ""The Black Rider"", and is based on ""Der Freisch√ºtz"" by Carl Maria von Weber. It was co-produced by Robert Wilson and the lyrics come from William S. Burroughs. The story is slightly reminiscent of Kurt Weil's and Berthold Brecht's ""Three Penny Opera"" and the 1930s. The debut performance of the play was in 1990 at the Thalia Theater, Hamburg and has been played by various theatre groups since then.

&gt; Waits was also responsible for two other musicals, which later became albums released simultaneously in 2002. One was the musical ""Blood Money,"" which covers the ""Woyczek"" theme of Georg B√ºchner. This one is one of the darkest works from Waits. The other musical is based on Lewis Carroll's classic children's novel, ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". ""Alice"" is very romantic, dreamy and soft, and contains one of Waits most romantic songs. Even though they were released at the same time, the bootlegs of the ""Alice"" musical were long before traded between fans and were just rearranged and re-mastered for the official release.

&gt; Besides many film contributions as composer ‚Äì the Internet Movie Database imdb.com lists 47 appearances of Waits as composer and 38 soundtracks containing songs by Waits - he also is an actor with a total of 25 appearances, ranging from some mini-roles as a trumpeter in ""Heart of Saturday Night"" and the R. M. Renfield in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" to the major role of Zack in Jim Jarmusch's ""Down by Law"". He recently appeared in Roberto Benigni's ""The Tiger and the Snow"", playing You Can Never Hold Back Spring at Benigni's wedding dream.  Even more recently, Waits played Mr.Nick (the Devil) in Terry Gilliam's ""The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus"".

&gt; In addition to a number of concert videos, he also appeared in the critically-acclaimed concert feature film ""Big Time"" (1990).

&gt; Waits has always refused to allow the use of his songs in commercials. He has filed several lawsuits against advertisers for using his material without permission. Waits also successfully sued an advertiser for using a work that was stylistically similar to his work, after he had declined to sell them the rights to his song. He has been quoted as saying, ""Apparently the highest compliment our culture grants artists nowadays is to be in an ad ‚Äî ideally naked and purring on the hood of a new car.  I have adamantly and repeatedly refused this dubious honor.""

"Have heard very good things (including from posts &amp; comments here) about the Ring doorbell, I think it both shows you who is at the door in real time (maybe through an app?) and also can make / keep a recording of their visit to help with documentation. (If the next 24 hours or so go smoothly, I may have one by the weekend to test out myself, if this happens I‚Äôll try to remember to update once I‚Äôve had a chance to test drive it.)"
They arent that hard tbh. I finished them on the weekend.
"I've always purchased from smaller lots, mostly because they have had the cars I could afford. Some small lots are shitty, some are just a dude running a small business flipping cars. Do your research on the dealer, do your research on the car. Check the Carfax, thorough test drive, look up the vin on the toyota owners page to see the service records not in the carfax, get an independent inspection, I've even heard of people contacting previous owners to see why they got rid of the car. If anything looks off, walk away."

"In watchOS 3 there was a loophole in that many developers were taking advantage of to allow for music to play in the background, where they would ""pretend"" their app was a workout app to run in the background. In watchOS 4, [Apple removed this loophole,](https://marco.org/2017/08/10/removed-send-to-watch) and because of this the development of Apple Watch support for Spotify was set back quite a bit, as it was likely relying on the loophole. Spotify could no longer offer a fully-featured watchOS app.

In watchOS 4, the only way to play audio at all on the Apple Watch is using a `WKAudioFilePlayer` API, which ""has major shortcomings, bugs, and non-ideal behaviors for making a usable [music] app"" [according to  Overcast developer Marco Arment.](https://marco.org/2017/08/10/removed-send-to-watch).

I appreciate the work that the MTL editors are putting forth, but for some reason they manage to butcher every other sentence they produce. Even when a sentence is edited to be grammatically sound, it is structured badly enough to break my reading flow."

"I know you really tried Neuro but this is exactly what I feared.

All the changes are focused towards support Karma. I was genuinely hoping some spells would actually be altered to do something new for Mid karma as it is extremely boring to have only one proper nuke spell with hard target accessibility. Having her Q like Brand W would make focusing so much more practical. The reason she actually is played as a support is because she has been a shield bot since u stripped her identity away over time (mainly looking at u shield bomb). Other mages do what she does 100x better, that is why.

As for her ""identity"", we all wanted her to be the spiritual leader of Ionia and that to be portrayed in her abilities. Sadly, this change that was promised **2 months** ago did not fulfill this identity whatsoever in my personal opinion. With these changes the only thing she will be known for is provide mana so that caster ADC's are better early. There was this idea of Karma doing something out of her main body channeled, what happened to unique ideas like those?

Why cant they just give us our shield bomb back, this would have give her that extra UMPH and give her a real identity as if aiding her people in need and being a force to be reckoned with. Sorry but giving CD and mana makes her feel like old Soraka battery charge mode completely dependent on your team. Time management probably the issue here, again sadly.

If I am completely honest this felt like receiving the christmas gift from last year wrapped in some fancy words.

For the people that mainly support I truly hope you are satisfied with these changes as I have given up on this champion. This may seem like a  negative post but i needed to portray my true feelings towards these changes as I have waited a long time to witness them and hope some other changes for mid karma may come later on."

Something I hadn't considered is that since I've had wealth management we've been in a fairly favorable financial climate. It's possible that during a recession I'd be lost and panic.

"Redmelly86.  Thank you!!  How does a person get a chemical analysis done?  Why hasn‚Äôt  someone taken those thrive shakes powders vitamins etc and really looked at them under a microscope.  I watched the video of him talking on the porch at least 10 times. He‚Äôs not laughing. That laugh is really the beginning of what tough guys do when they start to cry. He‚Äôs a bad actor. But I really believe he didn‚Äôt mean to kill the girls. I really believe he went into some kind of a rage because he was hopped up on stimulants and steroids and crap from those vitamins.  And she and him got into a fight and he smacked her.  I think the babies woke up and the fight escalated. And he decided he had had enough.  And he choked her.  And maybe he drowned the girls. 

I so hope he killed them quick.  The sheets in the garbage say it got messy.... but not messy and not enough time to wash them?  Maybe he put them in the oil to hide the water in their lungs.  I think he left a corner of the sheet hanging out of the ground so that he could find her in the dark and get her in the oil later on.  I don‚Äôt believe he killed the girls before she got home because he would‚Äôve had time not to throw sheets in the garbage can. He could‚Äôve gotten rid of those things cleaned up everything if he killed her at 2 o‚Äôclock am and let the house three hours later.  That‚Äôs more than enough time.  

Here‚Äôs the thing how does anybody stay awake that long without being on some kind of stimulant? Again I think that thrive stuff is super potent.  Now the defense wants to hide his health records? Probably because it will show he has steroids in his system.  Look at the transformation he had.  His rented wedding tux wasn‚Äôt even fitted to him...pants hanging off him.  He had some kind of awful ugly handlebar mustache. So Mr. Dough boy transformed into ‚ÄúMr. metrosexual push-up with kids on his back Superman..‚Äù You can‚Äôt transform like that without chemical help.  

Steroids made him nuts.  Her constant belittling him made him pissed.  The videos made him more pissed.  Watch the Christmas video is just painful. She is totally wigged out of her mind because she‚Äôs also overstimulated by whatever they were consuming. Not to mention I read she was OCD or so her girlfriend said. But during the video where they were in San Diego you hear him in the background groaning when she tries to get them on the video. And then when she says she can get him to do anything in another video and says  she‚Äôll be on washing his face in 5 minutes, I don‚Äôt know if she ever got him to do a new video live five minutes later.   

I think she was diluted.  Why would she post that horrible pregnancy reveal video when it‚Äôs obvious the guy is not excited. To me that shows she j was living in a fantasy of her own choosing and completely deluded probably again by whatever chemicals were in those thrive shakes and vitamins. 

Why isn‚Äôt anybody talking about this? Why isn‚Äôt anybody doing a chemical analysis of that crap? I just don‚Äôt understand.  Thanks for letting me do a total memory dump here.  I‚Äôve read stuff all day and everyone is right on some points and way off base on others.  I need to get this all out so I can let this horrible crime be resolved in my head.  

I think that‚Äôs why the crime is so talked about...could happen to anyone.  The signs were just missed When everybody wants to assure that they won‚Äôt miss the signs if they appear in their life with their loved ones.  

My condolences to her family of course and I thank you for your condolence for my dad. He would have loved discussing this case.  "

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/eb40a62777d64a1783988c4afa641821.png)  

&gt; In the summer of 2005, after a series of deaths in the family, Michael Deni left his hometown in New Jersey for San Francisco. He spent the next several months with his guitar and a synthesizer, turning that tragedy into the songs that would soon become the foundation for Geographer.

&gt; With the additions of cellist Nathan Blaz and drummer Brian Ostreicher, Geographer spent the next year cutting their teeth in the Bay Area, winning over crowds with the heart-pounding epics that make up their debut record, ‚ÄòInnocent Ghosts‚Äô.

&gt; After being selected one of three ‚ÄòUndiscovered Bands You Need To Hear Now‚Äô by SPIN Magazine and garnering considerable word-of-mouth praise from their energetic live shows, the band signed to San Francisco-based label Tricycle Records, releasing a 7‚Äù single for the song ‚ÄòKites‚Äô in October 2009.

&gt; ‚ÄòAnimal Shapes‚Äô follows up ‚ÄòKites‚Äô, building on the synth-driven aesthetic of the single, while flirting with darker, more esoteric underpinnings. The record merges Geographer‚Äôs aptitude for crafting beautiful, haunting melodies with textural sounds and poly-rhythmic energy, marking an evolution of their distinct style.

&gt; With the overwhelming response to the release of ‚ÄòKites‚Äô and ‚ÄòAnimal Shapes‚Äô, punctuated by a dynamic and engaging live set, the band has already begun to make an indelible mark on the ears of music fans worldwide. Read more on Last.fm.

"I had already been in my committed relationship for 10 years when I went back to grad school, and then had 3 years of LDR.

* Attend assorted campus events or clubs - my favorite was all the cultural clubs would have dinners of their traditional food, like Chinese New Year or Persian New Year. But there‚Äôs also clubs around hobbies, religious groups, learning a new language, and more. These may be aimed at undergrads, but most do accept grads.
* Attend events specifically for grad students or other non-traditional students (such as parents). For example, there was a religious club that held a grad student mixer each semester, and even though I‚Äôm not religious I enjoyed the socialization and connection to people in similar situations. I also liked when the non-traditional students office did family movie night, with second-run G rated films, and lots of adorable kids belonging to other people.

What they do is raise the pizza stone up so you don't have deal with retrieving the pizza down below the lip of the kettle. That's nice but not necessary. You could use bricks or something similar too. The pizzaque also provides a cheap and clumsy way to keep to coals back and to the sides so the stone doesn't get super-heated and burn the bottom of the pizza before the top is cooked.

"While I agree I think this isn't analogous to a hostage situation, I sympathize with the perspective that the students are caught in the middle of a battle whose outcome they cannot exert control over, and that this does not necessarily need to be the case.

&gt;First of all, even if it were true (which it isnt) that the workers were antagonizing the students intentionally ...

I think you'd struggle to explain how airhorns, drums, and screaming at 6AM (in my experience, on De Neve drive near the tennis courts, but others have said it also happened elsewhere) is not *intentionally* antagonizing the students. Unless Gene Block and his administrative cronies are secretly part of the faculty-in-residence program, and the strikers are trying to hunt them down. Or how walking around the court of sciences (yelling and using air horns) near CS24, 50, and 76 (heard firsthand, though perhaps they were farther away), or right outside of Kaplan and Powell (according to some students I have spoken to) whilst lectures and office hours are taking place is not *intentionally* antagonizing students. To my knowledge, there are no administrative offices in either of those vicinities.

&gt;Day after day they grind through the theft of their labor by a corrupt, out of touch employer, who is concerned more with making sure their primary funders (the students) ...

Speaking of being out of touch with reality: tuition is \~13% of UC revenue. The primary sources of UC revenue come from the state and federal governments, and other sources (private donations, alumni, etc). The UC cash flow might be quite high (\~33B, spread across 9 campuses and other administrative offices), but *the vast majority* comes in as funds from tuition, medical centers, the state, the feds, and private donations, and is spent on *salary, wages, and benefits*. \~30% of the UC budget goes towards *staff pay and benefits* (that is to say, not professors).

&gt;Personally, as far as I'm concerned, the workers should strike until their demands are fully met.

I feel like this should be a very, very, very obvious point, but, *if staff pay and benefits increase, then that money will come from somewhere - and somewhere won't be the state, the feds, the students, or private donors, it will be classes, research, new construction, medical centers, etc.* Some research programs would collapse if so much as a few hundred dollars for equipment, or one staff/faculty salary were removed from their allotment. So you need to decide if the quality of your education and the research output of this University is more important than satisfying union demands for wages and benefits already well above the market average. You cannot have it both ways, and you clearly have not pondered the consequences of your suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe there is a *different* discussion to be had about the state of our economic system, in particular the way it assigns value to work. But that discussion should not be taking place in the form of a ridiculously carried out strike on a university campus, whose demands are silly. And if you think that discussion should be had, then you (along with the strikers and the union) are barking up the wrong tree, because it takes place on the city, state, and federal level. *The University of California is not an entity capable of independently dealing with the rising cost of living in, commute times, and other issues faced by the workers. Even if it were to commit the entirety of its 33 billion dollar cash flow, it wouldn't even scratch the surface.*"

Hell, I bet your average southerner would put in extra efforts to ensure the black college never even got built.

"Involuntary movements in meditation are not at all uncommon. They've been called kriyas among other things (not to be confused with kriya yoga).

I suggest that you visit a credentialed acupuncturist, one that is familiar with Qigong, because such movements are sometimes seen in Qigong meditation.

The usual advice with these movements is to be neutral toward them, neither trying to stop them nor wanting them to continue. There can be situations in which the movements are too exaggerated and disruptive and then you have to make them stop, but in general let them be.

And if the movements persist outside of meditation, that is a different issue, and might need conventional medical attention. For most people who experience this however, the movements are limited to meditation and diminish in time.

If you feel worse after meditating you may need to reevaluate the technique and path you are following, or review the instructions. Meditation should support you in dealing with work stress, not be the cause of stress.

The fastest benefit for work stress that I know of is the Taoist meditation called Embryonic Breathing. This is not mindfulness breathing. It is a mind-body practice where you place (and keep) your mind in your *Dantien* or gut center below and behind the navel, while breathing smoothly through the nose.

You really have to train your mental attention to stay focused on this area deep in your abdomen, but it can do great things for your personal stability. Something as simple as drinking, or imagining drinking, a glass of iced tea and feeling it go down can help you get focused in the general area. But if you want to try this meditation read up on the Dantien and where it is."

"I think your basic point has a lot of validity, but I also think it's possible that some clever hybrid system could be developed which yielded the best of both worlds. For instance, imagine a law stating that when a company creates a new health care product, they have unfettered free rein to charge whatever they want for ten years. After that, they will have to sell it at a modest profit (with a lot of transparency and accountability in the pricing) to the government, who will turn around and provide it to all citizens as part of universal health care. So everyone gets free universal health care that is top of the line up to date as of 10 years ago, but anyone who wants anything fancier than that has to pay for it, and drug companies are free to make as much money as they can for a while, after which they'll still make plenty of money, but not in a ruinous fashion. Certainly not a perfect idea, but I feel like there are ways that things could be made to work together."

Our bodies are going to change. Some things we can control, and some we can't. And sometimes traumatic things happen that completely change everything. But if you want your love to last, you have to find a way to look beyond all of that and focus on the heart of that one person you can't live without. And once you figure that out, going to the gym with her every now and then won't hurt üòú"

I knew I was slightly overweight and coming from a rational perspective, if my boyfriend mentioned to me that he wanted me to be healthier, I would not at all have been offended. At some point, I felt it was unreasonable to gain a significant amount of weight and expect my partner to think I was unconditionally beautiful because if it were reversed, I'd have also wanted him to be healthier. It's so much better to be honest and open with your partner about this issue because deep down, I'm 100% sure they know that they've gained weight.

"These are excellent questions.  The Libertarian party platform is careful about calling for ""unregulated competition"" but not unregulated markets.  Additionally, the platform asserts that ""markets are not actually free unless fraud is vigorously combated.""  I'm totally on board with going after the big banks and eliminating corporate welfare.  However, there are plenty of anarcho-capitalist Libertarians who completely miss the point, imo, that markets are by definition not free unless they're competitive and unless the state steps in to prevent corporations from defrauding individuals.

As to your point on market externalities-- that's precisely why I reject the Environment section of the Libertarian platform (hence why I call myself an ""environmentally conscious"" Libertarian).  I can't defend the party on that one.  The platform calls for a market solution and explicitly says that the gov't should stay out of it, and I just don't think that's practical.  We're living on borrowed time to fix climate change.  Furthermore, I believe it's actually a violation of the Non-Aggression Principle if we do nothing about it and leave the world worse than we found it for future generations.

I think you're absolutely right that government intervention is necessary to combat ignored externalities, as well as economies of scale, the tragedy of the commons, and all the other Econ 101 terms that describe ways in which markets can fail to settle on efficient equilibria."

"&gt;Do you have any idea what a ""heuristic"" is? I've just given a counter example to the idea that it is the final arbitrator of truth.

And yet you've provided no reason to think that what you claim to be the truth is.   Looks like we're going with parsimony if you can't provide something better, if only because we avoid leaping to silly conclusions thereby.

This _might_ come as a surprise to you, but pointing out that parsimony doesn't always find truth doesn't lend any credence to your own truth-claim, nor make its means of support any more sound.

&gt;So a pattern is a coherent system with discernibly interrelated parts and a rule is a principle or regulation of arrangements, among other things. If parts are in a relationship with each other they are necessarily in an arrangement. Hence patterns imply the reality of a rule for the pattern. And nobody denies that the natural universe exhibits patterns.

Patterns are systems of physical things, and thus patterns are also physical things.  Arrangements of physical things are, surprise surprise, also physical things.  Thus, rules derived from physical patterns and physical arrangements are physical rules.

Did you not read what I wrote?  I asked you to demonstrate _non-physical_ ""meta-rules"" exist, and all you've done here is suggest rules exist.

&gt;Okay the meta-rules are not made out of matter, energy, space, time or information. It would be like confusing ink on paper with words: obviously the rules are expressed in physical behaviour, but the rules themselves are not physical.

So prove it already!  You seem to think you have a reason to think so, but you've not provided anything that can't be explained by the rules being physical.

&gt;What the hell do you think I've been doing thus far?

If I had to guess, I'd go with ""using circular reasoning and argument by assertion to try to prop up a point that you don't have proper support for"".  I could be wrong, but each post lends more support for this hypothesis."

Hey, that's me! Thanks for making this post! I know for some people, myself included, this is basically our ""endgame""; It's really a ton of fun to organise and run these events. Speaking for myself (although I assume this is true for a lot of us), I run them because it makes me super happy to see newer players be surprised by a hero point train &amp; then see them excited to unlock their first elite spec... or a commander running a boss event... or even just mentors hanging around starting areas helping people get to grips with the game.

I thought Elon also said they can source the cells from other than Panasonic, which I did not think was true for the 2170 cells the model three uses.

This answer and other statements during the call suggest cell supply constraint was not a reason for introducing the mid-range variant, contrary to what I and some others had hypothesized.

Still though, I heard nothing to indicate model 3 production ramp would *accelerate* in Q4. So I'm still thinking a continued slow rate of increase, perhaps until they are ready for Europe which obviously opens up a big new bag of demand."

"For one, we have a real definition of a mental disorder: something that causes distress or inhibits an individual. Homosexuality does not do that. Two, organisms do not have 'goals', the theory of evolution is not that evolution's goal is reproduction. Evolution is about reproduction, but that does not necessitate that every organism reproduce, there are other species that do not have every member of it's species reproduce, like drone bees. Lastly, you bring up the point that a primal instinct to have children is programmed into our brains. There are plenty of people who do not want children, this is not a mental illness. Particularly because there is nothing that defines us as human that we have to have children. You are arguing that there is a default state to humanity's psyche but there isn't. A deviation from the norm is not a mental illness."

There's a quote that sticks with me from an aboriginal elder I once talked to because of how poignant it was. ""The old fellas, they drink to forget the past. The young fellas, they drink to forget the future""  


Culture and connection to land are extremely important to all native populations and having your culture/language almost completely obliterated by generations of kidnapping and/or whitewashing has had a significant impact on their psyches. Being forced to pack up and move away from your sacred ancestral sites so somebody can build a mine or a pipeline is also a pretty harsh blow. Strip away some of the things that people have held most dearly for hundreds or even thousands of years and you leave a void where a sense of belonging once resided.  


Your isolation theory is reductive and patronising. I understand your perspective, but you need to take the time to try to understand the native perspective otherwise again you're just being disingenuous in your efforts to explain what the problems are."

"So a couple years back my mother and I went to our local polling place to vote in the primaries. This is deep rural south ga and we both had to fill out this small form to which we included name address and check either Republican, Democrat, or Independent.

We then received this color coded card and went to the poll stations which were standing computer stations partitioned apart from each other.

My mother traditionally votes down the Republican line, but this time she was going to vote independent. (After convincing her to feel the bern)

Even though she selected independent, when she went to the computer, she was only presented with the Republican options...

We had to call over for help and wait for like 15 minutes(not too bad) for the polling employees to correct the mistake and then we went on about our way.


I always wondered if that was an isolated incident or not....

the only benefit i can see from tri, besides the 10% extra cdr and minuscule hp and mana is the dmg to towers... which, who the hell splitpushes on shaco anymore? i don't think the AS is that big of a deal since tabis kinda negate AS partially, more than any other stat.

trust me, i've asked everyone to try to redpill me on triforce and no one has stepped up to the plate yet. none of these really adamant high elo shaco mains care to defend their purchase of a subpar item. the one person who tried to defend it came up with ""well it just feels better"", which isn't a very compelling argument.

&gt;Actually doesn't your own source contradict you? 

No, because wages rose to their highest level since 2008.  Rising wages are a good thing considering [wages have been in decline since the 1970s](https://www.brookings.edu/multi-chapter-report/revitalizing-wage-growth-policies-to-get-american-workers-a-raise/).

&gt;Because of steel tariff, while other industries that BUY steel are running short.

Source/example?

&gt;Individual companies making noise, but isn't total job growth lower and slower than under Obama? 

Well yes, because [there are more jobs than people out of work, something the American economy has never experienced before](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/05/there-are-more-jobs-than-people-out-of-work.html).

&gt;A receipt increase of only 0.4% despite the trillion and a half deficit and the what 2.9% inflation rate? AND a deficit increase?

Agreed.  We will see even higher record receipt of tax revenue.  We need to cut spending.

&gt;So with the job growth as false and the job openings flat and the real wages flat, all we have left from the trillions in tax cuts is company bonuses. How confident are you that these outpace what would have been the gov spending?

You haven't posted anything to show job growth is false and job openings is flat because of what I have proven.  Wages are at their highest and climbing higher.

&gt;How confident are you that these outpace what would have been the gov spending?

Hopefully spending cuts come soon, mostly from social programs so we can pump more into the miltiary.

"&gt; There's a fairly substantial argument to be made (and one that I implied in my post) that those neoliberal policies aren't actually Kaldor-Hicks-optimising - which is an astonishingly low bar anyway.

I was talking about how a K-H policy isn't good enough, so one that doesn't even manage that is obviously included.  If you like, replace Kaldor-Hicks with ""Kaldor-Hicks, at best"".

&gt; As for Brexit being free of plans or substance beyond an end-goal, that's the fault of the politicians who were tasked with implementing it. None of them actually wanted Brexit to happen and are doing their best to stymie the will of the voters - many of the pro-Brexit politicians and activists had very clear visions of the future...but that's exactly why the government is doing whatever it can to make sure they don't get a seat at the table.

My exposure to news about Brexit was likely pretty one-sided, but my impression is that the pro-Leave politicians failed to offer any sort of plan either during or after the campaign.  It's possible that I'm mistaken here though. Besides, having a vision in a democracy isn't sufficient if you don't have a political plan for it.  We all have our if-I-were-king fantasies, and none of them would survive intact if we were (e.g.) elected to the presidency.  Bernie Sanders was rightly mocked for saying ""break up the banks"" and failing to specify how he would (legally or politically) do so.

Also, the plans from pro-Brexit folk that I have had exposure to usually fall back on ""if we don't manage a planned transition, we'll just drop to WTO rules and work from there"", and it seems to me that problems like the pharmaceuticals one described above would still occur under those rules.  Though again, perhaps my gap in understanding here is coming purely from ignorance of how Britain's trade policy works, and there is some clear, reasonable path that I'm unawrae of."

"Im a Canadian citizen who travels to the US regularly. I also work in a Bank here in Canada.  This is my vantage point and experience.  I do not know about money transfers from the US to Canada on an hadoc basis, but I can tell you that Paypal transfers from one country to the other work well, as long as both accounts have been verified by Paypal.  Credit Cards, once you have advised them that you will be using them in both countries (a simple phone call) work seamlessly.  You only have to pay the exchange rate of your card for CAD currency (assuming you will be using a US credit card - usually a bit expensive but nothing to go cry to your mother, at least for the issuer Banks I have used).  Finally, if this is going to be a long haul situation, I would definitely open an account in a US branch of a Bank that does business in both Canada and the US (TD Bank, Harris Bank/Bank of Montreal, Wells Fargo, to name a few -  I do not work in any of these) and I would give my second half access from the Canadian side to the same account.

"You know what? Your comment made me Google the use of ""femme"" in an exclusively lesbian context which led me into a google swamp of the kind of pomo gender bullshit that lead us to the sad state of affairs that necessitates this group.

‚ÄúThe butch/femme dynamic is a conscious, loving binary of desire and trust ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a dance of love and outlawed romance. Butches and femmes share a sense of tribe, extended family and kinship‚Äîno matter what our genders might be‚Äù.[8] (Ivan Coyote, that reknowned spokesthem of all things gender-rational s/)

&gt;The postmodern queer conception of femme is a femme-identified person who does not always dress or act in a ""traditionally feminine"" (meaning a feminine aesthetic, such as wearing makeup, heels, and numerous accessories) way, but who expresses femme identity through feminine-associated behaviours, interactions and political views.[13] Rather than an erotic identity rooted in lesbian women's culture, queer femme has been reframed into a political identity that is inclusive of all who wish to identify with it, feminine-presenting or not. As femme has moved into the mainstream, it has also been connected to notions of emotional labor, witchcraft and self-empowerment.[14] (wikipedia, where else)

So no I mean femme, which is a French word meaning woman.

If i say that there are politicians in office with mental illness, you'll meet that with a no.

If i say the amount of people who actually use services but don't need them is actually minuscule...you'll meet that with a no.

&gt;And TBH most real sufferers don't want anyone to know, because unlike the frauds

If that's the case then they need the help even more. Look, this won't end well in any way shape or form. So i'll ask you the same thing i asked them. Would it be possible to agree to disagree here? Cause so far you've just so no to every point i've made without much to back it up. And this is a very important topic that doesn't get helped by that sort of behavior...soooooo agree to disagree?"

"That's literally how I interpret the rule. I believe the other mods interpret it the same based on their removal history. Otherwise, any negativity or insult towards the president, or anyone else not commenting here (I.e any public or private figure), would be removed. Up until the person is commenting here, they are fair game and not covered by the rules.

The rule is meant for respecting other commenters here, in the direct context of an argument between two or more people. It's not meant to apply to every person on every sub across the world. If they want to come here and comment, they would be afforded the benefit of rule 1. We're kind of like a country with no borders. Just show up and you get citizenship.

&gt; What are your interests/what type of subreddit would you prefer to moderate?

- My interests revolve around video games mostly, but I also enjoy browsing niche subs and such that new users are automatically subscribed to. I have CSS experience, so if anything, I could try and help out with the design of your subreddit if I do not otherwise suit it.


&gt; Are you willing to moderate an NSFW subreddit?

 - I am willing to moderate an NSFW subreddit. I am impartial to the sub that needs moderation help at the moment, but will review any subs that reach out to see if I would make a good fit there. While not opposed to moderating an NSFW sub, if it's not a good match for me personally, I would have to decline; same goes for any subreddit really.


&gt; How active are you (Eg, hours per day) and what timezone are you in?

 - I am in the PDT time zone (UTC -7) and am active for anywhere from 5-8 hours a day, depending on the day. I spend a lot of my free time on Reddit, and would be available for a large number of hours on any given day.



&gt; If you see a highly upvoted post but it doesn't follow the rules what would you do?

 -  If I saw a highly upvoted post that didn't follow the rules, I would let it have it's time at the top of the subs ""hot"" filter, but would lock it after it's had enough time there. It is important to enforce the rules, but it is also important to be understanding and lenient in certain cases. This is really done on a case by case basis, and it's hard to evaluate this question without seeing a specific example. It all depends on the culture of the subreddit in question.


&gt; In your opinion, what is the most important quality a moderator can have?

- The most important quality that a moderator on any subreddit is being part of the community. Nobody likes to be governed by someone that they feel doesn't represent them, and this is also true for subreddits. If the community of a sub doesn't feel like the moderators are ""one of them"" in a sense, then the sense of community starts to degrade. A moderators job is not only to enforce the rules of the subreddit, but also to strengthen the feeling of community, and help it grow and be more successful. A moderator at its core should be an understanding person who wants the best for the sub and to see it succeed, and not just someone looking for a position of power.



Please PM me any follow up questions, I would be more than happy to tell you more about myself, and we can exchange information about your subreddit and the goals which you are striving towards. I will have my own set of questions per reply, I look forward to further applying for your moderation team."

"That I 100% remember ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you at our high school reunion.‚Äù  While signing my yearbook. There were a bunch of festivities after that which I‚Äôm sure we talked at but I don‚Äôt quite remember what was said but that was the last thing.

- I started dating one of his close friends which meant I would have seen him eventually once he was allowed some time off, well before our high school reunion. I sat beside him every day in class for a year (I was a new student my final year of school)

- it made me rethink a lot of things about my life and how people act. i have the day we found out burned into my mind (he committed suicide) and how we found out and how my now ex‚Äôs dad knew before us but couldn‚Äôt tell his son that his childhood friend had died because he was a police officer and it was his job to communicate it to the family and couldn‚Äôt tell us nor did he want that to be the person to tell my ex, and then the funeral. and how unfortunate it was that people who never really interacted with him at all made it a popularity contest and were nasty to others at a funeral.

Turns out she doesn't even have lenses in them. My Gf tells me this and I'm thinking, no no, people's views on nerds and geeks are so skewed. Nerds are high on the end of intelligence and will mansplain you correct information all the while being obnoxious. Geeks bathe themselves in comic, manga, video game memorabilia while spanking it to Bayonetta. Just having glasses is not what makes a nerd. Glasses without lenses makes you a frickin poser.

"NCAA won't ever do anything about it but if the school's starting losing accreditation, things might change."
"So the GOP has a targeted strategy. They know basically who will vote for them and who won't. White people, specifically older whites and less educated whites vote Republican, so they go after them. They know their rhetoric turns off blacks, hispanics, young people, LGBT, etc. etc. and they don't care, because their target audience is white voters. 

White voters make up ~75% of all voters nationally (probably more in OK). So the GOP has to win a majority of white voters (which they always do) to have a chance. If they can win 2/3rds of whites, they can pretty much win any national election. If they can win around 60% they have a great chance at winning, especially if democratic turnout is low. 

So that's the GOP strategy: go for whites. Not even all whites, just a certain percentage of high turnout white votes. Remember, all you need is around 60% of whites to win. The rest don't matter. So try to win a majority of whites and you're golden.

How do you do that? Make them think 1) that the country is theirs, they're the REAL America, 2) that their culture and traditions are under attack, 3) that immigrants, Democrats, and ""others"" (i.e. use coded dog whistles to mean black people) are the ones attacking, 4) that dems are for socialism and handouts, and that ""welfare queens"" and ""you know who"" (i.e. blacks) will be the real ones to benefit while hard working whites suffer, etc. 5) mention hard work and personal responsibility because lots of whites view that as a code for white virtue (even if the bulk of actual policy favors tax cuts for the wealth). 

That's not going to win over large swaths of the electorate, but it will play to the only, and I mean the ONLY group that Republicans have left. They have doubled down on White power rather than try to expand their message to attract other groups, so that's who they go for.

On the flipside, Dems have to be the party of mass appeal because pretty much everyone else votes for them. This makes them an easy target for attacks, and makes it difficult for them to make targeted attacks, as their base is so diverse and they don't want to alienate anyone. "

"**Vegetable**

Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans as food as part of a meal.  The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, nuts, and cereal grains, but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.

What is posted in r/atheism is purely against all Christians, and most definitely doesn't show love from what ive seen. I understand where you come from, and i honestly am not mad at you. I cant control what you see in the news, on the internet, or anywhere. That's why I'm here to forgive you and show you that we're here to love.

"Asking politely. 

Sharing space with other people is a good recipe for things like these. What you need to do is build arguments that could make your roommate to empathize with you. Explain that common areas are for everyone to enjoy and there should be a minimun of hygiene needed in the first place. Also explain that you manage your times differently, that you need to rest, to focus on the the things you do and sometimes he makes too much noise and it makes it difficult for you to enjoy the space too. 

&amp;#x200B;

As long as you do all of the above in a calmed manner, without threats, strong language or pasive aggresiveness and with an intention to solve the issue with ease there's a good possibility that he responds properly. If your roommate is an asshole those possibilites lower significantly tho."

"Hiya! I left my grammar related comments on the google doc itself, so this critique will be (as usual) focusing more on the abstract components of the story.

You say that you wrote this to strengthen your characters, but is this intent actually reflected within your story? The start of the story is decentered from cast you later introduce, more focused on the location than the characters.

&gt;The line into the bar was cramped and crowded, party animals and lone drinkers alike were crushed together by a velvet rope and an urge to drink.

Now, I would say that there's nothing inherently wrong with introducing a story by its setting, but now that I think about it most of the stories I read don't take that route. *Ghosts* by Paul Auster starts with

&gt;First of all there is Blue.

Which you might think is describing the setting but it's actually naming a character, Blue. Not only that, but it's starting the story with such a frank and blunt opening that it primes us for the hard-boiled detective story it's about to launch off into (and promptly crash out of).*The Black Company* by Glen Cook starts with

&gt;There were prodigies and portents enough, One-Eye says.

Once again, starting the story with a character. Not only that, but it gives a hint towards its setting through tone/context. The name One-Eye, the mention of ""prodigies and portents"". You get a feeling for some sort of fantasy setting without it outright telling you. Flannery O'Connor's *A Good Man is Hard to Find* starts with 

&gt;The Grandmother didn't want to go to Florida.

Which actually accomplishes quite a bit for 8 words. It tells you that there's a grandmother, that someone wants to travel, that they're thinking about traveling to Florida, and that the Grandmother will probably try and work herself out of that trip to Florida. However, at its base level it is still a description of a character.

So what do these stories gain out of starting with a character that you lose? Well, let's see your first line again.

&gt;The line into the bar was cramped and crowded, party animals and lone drinkers alike were crushed together by a velvet rope and an urge to drink.

Longer than any other first line I've mentioned, but I'd posit it says less than any other one I've quoted. What do we get out of it?

&gt;the line into the bar was cramped and crowded

 There's a crowded bar.

&gt;party animals and lone drinkers alike were crushed together
 
It's a crowded bar. Don't we already know this?

&gt; by a velvet rope and an urge to drink.

People want to drink at a bar? There's a velvet rope at a bar? How is this supposed to interest me? More importantly, why is the beginning of a supposedly character-orientated piece telling me *nothing* about the characters?

Let's move onto the next paragraph.

&gt;‚ÄúYou‚Äôll love this place, it‚Äôs one of the best bars in the city.‚Äù Abby's face oozed joy. The natural white pupil and inky black sclera and iris of our brand of teaching bots was completely covered by contact lenses that gave her eyes a human look.

Alright, so we get a character! Why couldn't this have been the first paragraph? I mean, she mentions it's a bar in her first sentence, so it's not like we'd get confused about our setting. Also, you completely lose me with your description of her eyes. I think you're trying to portray her as robotic? I listed a replacement phrase that could work better in the doc.

&gt;‚ÄúI bet I will‚Äù I lied, adding a laugh to appease her. Why dDo I follow her? Because she‚Äôs your only friend and this is what friends do. I bet I could‚Äôve wrote a whole chapter in the time I spent here. And then you would cried yourself to sleep. Fair point. I slowed my breath and put on the least fake smile I could. 

Some people manage to create characters who are both self-loathing and likeable. You don't. Why do I care? I have heard literally nothing about this character before, and you introduce me to her while she's whining. Boo hoo, she's got a friend whose trying to take her to a bar and get her drinks. The horror. If this is a character orientated piece, why don't you let me get to relate to the character first before plunging her into the pits of despair?

&gt;After five more excruciating minutes of being pushed and shoved, we got in.

What happened to the characters? You immediately introduce the two of them, have them spout off a line each, break off into a monologue, and then jerk us away into the room. How am I going to make any sort of connection to your characters?

&gt; A little voice inside of me shouted, freedom! That voice was quickly crushed as I was pushed into a wall of people.

You have a bit of a bad habit with awkward repetition. You could combine these two sentences together and get a smoother overall product. *A little voice inside of me screamed for freedom before it was smothered by another wave of people, writhing in an alcohol-induced fugue*


&gt; The bar was full of people full of electronics, not a single other android in sight.

This is another example of unflattering repetition. On another note, you don't have to tell the reader there aren't any other androids in the bar. The rest of this story is filled with examples of people at this bar looking down on our main character and ostracizing her for being an android. I'm sure the readers'll be able to get the hint that androids aren't particularly welcome here.

 &gt;My chemical sensors went off erratically, telling me the smell of every molecule of air. Oh God!

Death to adverbs. Get rid of erratically. Plus the phrasing here is once again rather awkward. You want us to relate to this character, right? Do people ever say ""my nose went off erratically""? Why not phrase it in a more familiar way such as

*I flinched as a wave of beer-infused air hit me, my nose scrunching up as its chemical receptors went haywire.*

The end of the sentence has a robotic tinge to it, but it starts out in a very human way so that the reader wanders into the robotic feature rather than being hit face-first. It both allows us to relate to her and note what's different about her. 

&gt;I can feel my hardware melting.

You got a tense shift here. ""I could feel my hardware melting"" would be better and would match the tenses.

&gt;Make it stop! A scream forced itself up my throat. Keep quiet! If you scream, people will think you‚Äôre broken and send you the the junkyard.

I don't know enough about this world to make a judgement on whether this is a real threat or a joke the character makes to herself. As a result, I find myself rather confused and the statement falls flat. This is literally 4 paragraphs into the story, try not to rely too much on the world you have in your head and talk more about the characters you have on your paper. Speaking of-

&gt; I clamped my mouth shut and fell back into my programming. 

Does she have programming? Does she have free will? This question may seem rather silly, but it's actually pretty important on how the reader's going to view your character. Is she capable of acting as a human being, or is she just a machine whose running through a set of predetermined actions? We know she's a robot, but we don't know what that exactly entails.

Again, we circle back to the character. What of it? What does this tell me about the character? Nothing I didn't already know. She's a robot and the smell's overwhelming her. I'm five paragraphs into this thing and I really don't see how this is supposed to be a character driven work. I have very little reason to care about either of them. That's not just a bad start to writing a character-orientated story, that's a bad start to writing a story in general. If you want to improve your work, start at the beginning. Many of the issues I've talked about here echo through the rest of your work. Fix this and you should see the other aspects of your writing improve as well. This is about all the time I have right now, but I might do more later. Good luck!"

"I'd be against turning it into an arc. The move arcs' expansion of some plot points was neat. However, this does not make up for the bad padding in some episodes, and poorer animation than the films. I'm not expecting movie level animation for a tv anime of course, but making essentially an uglier version of the film feels redundant. I think if they decided to make a small arc expanding the history of the saiyans and Frieza, then that could be cool. Just not the whole film. "

"Honestly you need to share these things with her. It is up to her to decide if she wants to change her body, but you should always be honest about how you feel. You could show her everything you just wrote (except for the ""and she's only 5'4"" part) and that would be a good starting place.  
 
If she is happy with who she is and how she looks, then you must accept not being sexually attracted to your partner, or worse, the lack of physical attraction will seep into the rest of your perception of her until feelings and respect are drained on both sides and eventually something breaks. 
 
Or, you end up telling her how you feel and she has no idea how you felt, and you talk with her for you *both* to decide it's time to start eating healthier and exercising. Because honestly gaining weight is less about not being physically attracted to her than it is about her forming more and more health problems over time. You don't want her to be getting sicker as she gets older because she's overweight, and you know she doesn't want that either (most likely). You both want the least amount of heartbreak and the most amount of time together, if you are both truly in love and both truly best friends. Medical complications really fucking suck.
  
You guys can decide together that you both want to stay healthy and attractive for each other and you both want to help and respect each other, because both of you will need support from each other to get through a change like this, but *none* of that is possible if you can't even be honest with her and communicate with her. Why she has gained weight may come out during this conversation too. If you find she's been depressed about something, or is slipping into severe depression, it's extremely important to talk all of it out and support your partner that you love and adore. 
 
Her gaining weight wouldn't be the threat to the end of something like this, but rather whatever lead to you guys forming a life where you guys don't talk openly and honestly about every single little thing (you need to if you want to spend the rest of your life with your actual partner) because now you're conflicted. You are scared to try to talk to her about it, and that's not a healthy position to be in. Nothing good comes of being unable to be honest with your true partner. 
 
You guys have to talk about it. "

"Oh, I see now, thanks. Wayne offers a concrete example of the abstract concept of delayed gratification. It's an idea that requires discipline. I think discipline is fundamental to self-actualization. I strongly believe the concept of *time-preference* is a great tool to become self-ware and cultivate one's discipline.

Discipline can be of voluntary or coerced nature. Voluntary means that you yourself are enforcing your own discipline - which is self-actualization in its literal sense: you act and you embody your actions, so to speak.

If your discipline stems from the arbitrary group that you choose to see yourself in, then you're actually not being yourself. But you're still acting along some guidelines, so apparently there's still some morality involved. I think that's the reason of the original question. Don't collectivists have morality, too?

Yes, they claim to have morals, but in my opinion they disqualify themselves, since they transgress the rights of the individual. Collectivists think that they have the right to coerce individuals to act in a certain way. That's where the focus of their attention lies.

What I'm trying to say is, that if the focus of your attention is not centered around yourself, your reason is not operating on your behalf. Most likely, you found a way to use your reason in a masturbatory, self-righteous way, under the guise of empathy and altruism. I'm not saying that the IDW is not guilty of that vice. But the reason why I chose to pay attention to this group, is because I see the potential to become aware of this problem and transcend it."

There is nothing special about ""11 years"". Historically, none have breached 11 years, yes. Historically, people with the last name ""Trump"" had never won a presidential election two years ago. Those two statements were equally true and are equally meaningless. There is nothing in the numbers that are available right now to suggest that this year everything is going to come crashing down... at least, nothing I'm aware of, though if you can point me to something, I'll gladly listen. From what I've read and heard, most analysts are predicting something to go down (pun not intended) about 1.5-2 years out based on quantitative factors like the yield curve's flattening. I believe BofA-ML said something very similar regarding their warning signs for recessions. That points to a 12 year, maybe longer, ""bull market"".

They walked into the hunting lodge and the smell of blood was a little overwhelming for her.  She had to avert her gaze from all the bloody parts of it.  Rowena didn't like to come in here much if only because the sight of blood made her a bit queasy.  But at least Lucas was here with her and she could focus on him and his gift instead.

Her eyes widened a little when she saw the hide of the deer all stretched out.  It would serve her well during the winter, she agreed with Lucas about that.

"I think some people are more sensitive to changes in their partners than others. As a plus-size woman myself, I'll say candidly that I think dramatic weight gain or other major changes of appearance in a relationship might well lead to a loss of attraction. For men especially, attraction does tend to be visual. Then again, there are other couples where one or both partners can more or less gain an entire person in weight, and attraction will still be there.

I do occasionally see posts here where it goes a bit too far though - where the rejected partner gained maybe 10-15 pounds and the rejecting partner is like ""I'm completely turned off, repulsed, and don't want to touch this person with a barge pole."" When you're in a long/lifetime relationship with someone, you have to anticipate there will be *some* changes in appearance over the years. If your attraction - and attachment - to them is so shallow that going up a dress size is enough to completely derail you, that's a problem.

I've known a couple guys like that in real life, where it was like ""any weight gain at all = I'm turned off and breaking up"". One of them was a personal trainer, he hugely valued fitness, from the sounds of it he'd lay out early in a relationship that if his partner ever started letting herself go, that would be it. He actually did dump someone in the time I knew him because she'd gained 10 pounds. That said, he was kind of an ass in several ways.

EDIT: I do feel someone needs to mention Rule 2 here - there have been phases on this sub where every time a HLF posted her story, someone would weigh in ""Did you gain any weight?"" One reason this topic doesn't get a lot of airtime is it brushes up against blaming the HL for the DB in an unproductive way - ""Your H doesn't want to fuck you cuz ur fat!!1!"""

"Here's the answer.  The powder coating on most racks has a dull and matte appearance.  The powder coating additive that prevents paint adhesion is called a slip agent, that's where the shiny powder coatings get their shine.  So, there's not too much slip agent in the matte rack coating.  Still, adhesion can be improved by lightly power sanding it with a 180 grit sandpaper.  This creates a powder dust on the surface of the track.  

Next, you prep the surface by wiping it down with a watery solution of tetrasodium pyrophosphate (don't worry, it's used in processed foods and toothpaste) then hose down the rack with with fresh water (or wipe it down several times with fresh water, not ideal.) Dry it thoroughly asap. If you hose it down the inside of the track will have water in it.  The inside is bare steel with a light oil and will trust if not dried quickly.  I use a leaf blower when I need to dry something fast.  Line up the parts and blow air through them.

Now it's ready to paint. Use this specific primer first called Xim UMA. One 16 oz spray can is far more than enough.  16 oz covers ~500 sf, the rack will only be around 40 sf of surface area:

Finally, paint it with a good quality acrylic alklyd paint.  It's available at any paint shop or hardware store in any color you want.  Follow the directions on the paint can. Use a quality nylon/polyester brush ($10, I use Wooster).  A high quality brush is totally worth the cost; a lesson I learned the hard way.  


If you do more than one coat, pour some acetone in a soup or coffee can and soak the brush bristles in it between coats. Acetone is really flammable, and vaporizes into the air.  Store the brush soaking can in a well ventilated space and away from flames, electric outlets, electric appliances, etc.  Use acetone to clean the brush and some on a rag to clean any spills or drops.

If you want to use spray paint find a high quality enamel paint.

It will take a week or two to cure to it's maximum hardness either way.  You can still use the rack in that time.

Total cost around $70 and about 4 hours of total work time.  If you do multiple coats it can take a few days.

"I'm not 100% vegan/vegetarian but I do try my best to eat mainly plant based meals. It is difficult living with family member(s) who do not have their core belief consuming a plant base diet. I have been there. I understand your frustration how some of your close family members are constantly clashing what should be on the dinner table. I personally ended up buying and cooking my own meals which led to me moving out so I can do my own thing without crowding the fridge. But I gotta keep in mind that you are 17 years old and may not have the financial resource to be independent. I think compromise is the key and it appears your mother is actually compromising ( eat meat less than half of the time). I don't think you should stop trying to eat vegetarian/vegan diet especially if you reap positive benefits from it. When you know you are ready to fully convert to a vegetarian diet, you will know.

"Generally we dislike transferring posting rights to new accounts. Normally it's harmless, but it has happened once or twice that someone who was ""done"" with polandball gave their posting rights to someone else by asking us if their rights could be transferred to a new account under the false guise that they were the owner of the second account as well.

Obviously those people, who can't go through a normal approval process, usually can't produce good comics and invariably get their posting rights taken away, but it creates administrative headaches for us.

For transferring of approval rights, we generally require a) that we're dealing with a submitter we already know very well, and b) some sort of credible proof that it's the same person owning the second account.

As such, we advise people to just go through the normal approval process again. If you could get approved once, that means you're good enough to get approved again without much issue."

And these comments about the Ukrain has reminded me of a group of Russians asking me once if I was from the Ukraine (in my youth when I lived in Europe) and at the time laughing it off because grandma had said Russia (I was young and ignorant of how the borders moved), but they'd said I'd had ""the look"" whatever that means.

"I looove poshmark! I've sold some things, and I've bought a few as well. For plus size shoppers especially, I think it's the best because it's tough enough to find stylish clothing in larger sizes without being frugal about it! But online second hand stores have so much good quality, good condition stuff for prices impossible to find elsewhere. I think they are a great option for people who are really particular about their personal style; for people whose primary value in dressing is utility, it's probably too involved a process to be worth it. I just bought a pair of amazing never-worn leather boots from the 80's for $26.50 including shipping. Got them today and they're beautiful!!! "

"is it? the only realistic criticism of the proposed definition is that it is too ruggedly scientific, given that in today's society we are more willing to tolerate people's faiths/beliefs in their self-professed identities.

that's why i consider the counter argument to be a faith-based/theological one. if people opposing the definition proposed by the administration used the argument that people should tolerate people's religio-gender based beliefs, and that this proposed definition is needlessly entrenched in biology and science, and this shows a lack of tolerance for people's religio-gender beliefs about their own identities, then it would at least make sense as an argument."

The NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 passed thanks to the GOP:

While in the Senate it went:

Bill Clinton ran as an skeptic of NAFTA in 1992 against HW and the signing was delayed by a few months as they had to return to the table and negotiate a couple of parallel agreements concerning - IIRC - labor protections in Mexico and environmental issues.

I would like to add a second comment to this thread as I have already commented above. Many people like to say that our problems are because of the baby boomers. I think that many people forget or purposely over look that the boomers are the ones who fought the battles for the civil rights movement and for things like the EPA. We as the newest generation now facing strife look for a easy entity to blame for many of the problems that we face. But let us not forget that generations before us fought many battles to get things like government backed student loans that have put many of us through college and gotten us into the lives we want. Many programs that we today take for granted. Looking forward let's not forget that many many of them are still fighting with us to make not only our world a better place but our countries and our families. Lets not give up on them. 
"I hope that you are seeking the assistance of a professional to work through this. If it's having this strong of an impact on you, you should talk to someone is qualified to truly help.

I was a page and an assistant all through my twenties and even now in my early thirties as a librarian I still get plenty of unwanted attention. I give people the cold shoulder or uninterested 'mmhm' noises. I take very big steps back from people who stand too close. I tell men 'I'm not interested' or I simply turn around and walk away. I know you probably think about all of these things already, which is why I think you should talk to somebody, because even doing some of those basic things is still very hard and often leaves me full of adrenaline and shaking, and I feel like I'm pretty capable of being direct when somebody is making me uncomfortable.

Being accommodating and deferring to others, especially to men, is so culturally ingrained that it feels like we are crossing a line or breaking a social taboo when we make a conscious choice to defend ourselves. Find someone you trust to talk through it. You don't have to dread going to work, and you shouldn't have to feel like you are in danger."

One can figure the set relayed to Betty was what Briggs told - so Ray and Ruth would have the same - but given that Ray is adamant that Betty will only talk to *him* and his later implication that his information couldn't be trusted anyway, it seems likely that Betty's info was false and so Ray's info would diverge from Ruth."

It was clearly states in the GCU rules that if you go over the limit this will happen. Another thing to remember is if you buy a copy of Black Ops 4 (just using as an example) and then decide to return it/repurchase it down the line for a cheaper price, that counts as two of the three you titles you are allowed per year.

Edit: Your pre-orders should still be there, you just have to have the original receipts to get your money back. GCU will not work on them now that you have been banned. If you don‚Äôt have the original receipts you might be able to look them up via your debit card, but I‚Äôm not sure how that works.

And yet there was that one time ‚Ä¶ what was her name, that common girl of yours? Becca? No, she was one of mine, gods love her, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in them. Yours was ‚Ä¶ Aleena? No. You told me once. Was it Merryl? You know the one I mean, your bastard's mother?""* **yawn**."
"Oh man, this is going way back and I'll try to remember the important details:

So we live in upstate New York near Fort Ontario. We have quite a few historical landmarks in town that each group randomly got assigned. Me and my buddies got assigned and had to do a report on the historical significance of Fort Ontario.

Now, the intention was for us to showcase the fact that during World War 2 it was used as a fort for Jewish refugees (and one of if not THE only safe haven for Jews during the time) but instead we decided to focus on the forts use during the French and Indian war and how it was featured on an episode of Ghost Hunters and spent an ungodly amount of time interviewing people around town that go to the fort to play with their dogs and go there for war reenactments. 

We ended the skit with (and I'm paraphrasing): ""Not only is Fort Ontario amazing for Ghost Hunters, War Reenactments and frisbee, but it was also used to help European refugees that were seeking asylum, but we couldn't find anyone alive back then to conduct an interview."""

"Feel like they should just get rid of shadowstep and create a new ability, something like a like a lifesteal grenade, with moderate damage, but with a high percentage of life steal. Or it could explode into a dark mist similar to what the character already has for certain abilities and could act as a small smoke screen which reaper has vision through, would help reaper take cleaner engages and close distances while not taking as much poke.
Those are 2 things I have given about 5 mins of thought and are 1 million times better than that stupid ability, after successfully predicting they would give reworked torb some sort of armour pen I hope by some higher power they rework shadowstep into something similar to the above."

Had my procedure done 20 hours ago. Only pain (2/10) was when they injected local anestetic in my balls. Similar to getting a filling. Slight delay during the procedure because my right side bag was thicker than left side and is now slightly bruised unlike my left. No pain just a very sight ache.  A small amount of spotting blood in boxer briefs yesterday but none today. Had a jock over those since the snip and will keep it on for a week Took a Tylenol just before bed last night just in case. Usualy a stomach sleeper but I wore a neck pillow to keep me on my back. Had a semi this morning and pissing is easiest if a pull pants down to knees. Taking a dump hasn‚Äôt been a challenge.

"He should have planned to utilize other resources than the Democratic Party several years earlier. Everyone and their children knew Hillary was going to run for President in 2016. The GOP had 25 years to prepare for that moment. 

Bernie should have planned to make a run for the primary, gather a following (both which he did), and then run for POTUS as an Independent with a full head of steam and individually donated funding to support it. He did not have to halfheartedly throw his support behind Hillary if he didn't agree with the outcome. The thousands I donated were directly to his campaign, not the DNC, same with millions more of us. This is what my donations helped support? Donald Trump and the GOP wiping their hindquarters with our beloved nation, the beacon of democracy.

"Depends on what you mean by those terms. A civilisation, such as the Roman civilisation, is not a distinct political entity, but rather a general amalgamation of beliefs and traditions among many other things. It is a common cultural movement which is vaguely defined. Civilisations still exist today, such as the Western civilisation, a cultural and ideational view of the world shared by western Europe and countries such as the US and Australia. There are many differences between and within the countries of Western civilisation, but they share a common base. The same could be said about a Roman civilisation, a social group which may not necessarily be united, but share a common general base. 

The Roman Empire (or republic too) on the other hand, was a distinct political entity. It interacted with other political entities as a cohesive unit, just as countries in the international system do today. In many ways the Roman Empire is comparable to the Soviet Union or US in the 20th century. There was centralised control over the Empire from Rome (or the various other capitals at different times), but the provinces usually had a degree of autonomy as their own political entities too. 

Just like there is a difference between a civilisation and an empire, there is a difference between a nation and a country. A nation is more like a civilisation, although at a smaller scale. A nation is group of people with a closely shared identity, based on ethnicity, beliefs, traditions and culture. In contrast, a modern country is a political entity that governs over a population and a territory. Often a nation and a country will overlap and form a nation-state, although this isn't necessarily the case. Russia, for example, is a political entity that governs over a set population and territory, but its population is not a homogeneous nation. Armenia on the other hand, has a strongly homogeneous nation for a population.

Its kind of expected when watching YouTube or doing other intensive tasks, but even when its idling, the fan is constantly blowing crazy amounts of heat. I also don't like the battery life, but that probably is a result of the cheap aftermarket battery. I don't like the trackpoint.

" I'm willing to believe these are your genuinely held beliefs and that you are not a troll so I will debate you on this with no malice. If you feel I mocking you please trust that I don't mean to do that, I think that I do actually do the research myself and don't believe everything I'm told, and these are the observations I made exactly because I value those principles.

On your first point. You are right to say that the proposed change would not in any legal sense take any right away from trans people except for the right of trans people to change their legal documentation to fit their lived gender.  So indeed it's not like trans  People will all of a sudden be prohibited from doing things they where doing before. But if you think about it  this is kind of a big deal. It will make living stealth completely impossible. Anyone that sees your legal documentation for any reason will instantly know your status as a trans person. Schools, jobs, bartenders, police that did a routine check, security at the local nightclub and so on and so on. Your gender marker on any ID would clearly state your birth gender. always. For many people this would mean they are suddenly outed. There are a lot of trans people out there who have already lived as their gender for years, even decades, and all of a sudden every telemarketer calling them would call them by their birth gender cause that's what's standing next to their name. This is extremely invasive and will make discriminating against trans people endlessly more easy. It will make international travel less safe for trans people. So while it may not in some strictly legal sense take away any right of trans people other then correcting their birth certificate, it is clearly designed to make life as hard as possible for trans people and make it harder for them to live a normal life and taking away rights indirectly.  

On your second point. The Muslim ban is a terrible idea and not based on any real threat. First of all, if you genuinely believe that the Muslim ban was done for America's safety then why did it not include a travel ban for Saudi citizens? 15 or of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 where Saudi citizens. No other Muslim country has ever caused even a fraction of the casualties then Saudi Arabia. If trump where truly concerned with national security shouldn't Saudi Arabia be on the top of his list?  Instead, it's not even on there at all. Secondly there is no genuine threat of safety from Muslim travellers, refugees or immigrants in the U.S. though it is definitely true that there are some unhinged Muslims out there, there are plenty of systems in place to catch those and the religious zealots of other faiths, long before they get to do the terror they plan to do. And though there is a slight over representation of Muslim terrorist violence, it is completely dwarfed by right wing extremist violence. There is no demographic group so dangerous in the U.S. as right wing white males are and funding to keep tabs on organisations such as the KKK and the ANP had been cut rather then expanded. 


This leaves us with the stark impression that even though trump may say he doesn't want to attack trans rights, he intends to do so anyway and even though he says the Muslim ban is not racist, his actions in relation to other terroristic threats  show that it is. "

Not sure what you mean.

I mean, I get the essence of what you're trying to say but not sure how you came to that conclusion that that's an inherent part of multi party systems. It's not. It's just a symptom of the system we use, a system that people centuries old decided was the way they wanted to do things.

I.e. Multi party electoral systems exist that don't result in ""that"" being what you get.

what's helpful for me at this point is developing a good skipping strategy for LR. if it's one of those really hard problems skip it and return to it. when i've done this it's helped me because sometimes i have a new perspective reading the stimulus again. also, for RC, maybe you could test out an annotating strategy? pretty much every company has a strategy and they all work but it's just a matter of finding a good fit for you. in my experience, at least, having a process down makes me a lot more comfortable and makes me not feel like i'm just winging it.  some people say that reading the economist helps but i'm not sure if that would be super useful in the short term?

"Perhaps because when we invented the language we specifically used terms to differentiate them on purpose as we thought it was not only reasonable but good to do so. At this point we have many different terms we can use to indicate all sorts of things, but changing the usage of language takes time and we've really only been moving in on genderization problems in the last ten or twenty years at most. Considering we've been speaking it for almost 600 years it's going to take a while to adjust. I'm also not personally sure why it's an issue to use gender in it's broader labeling sense. Much like we'd call a male rabbit a buck and a female rabbit a doe and kit is used universally for all pre-adult rabbits. There isn't a problem referring to a male rabbit as he, or a female rabbit as she, nor should there be. The idea that I cannot use the same labeling system for general usage of the male and female of any species including humans is a little ridiculous. I'm not saying that I don't or won't respect individuals chosen pronouns, but the idea that I can't use male/female when I have no idea what their chosen pronoun is, is again, a little ridiculous. Should we do this for all animals? How would we know what their preferred pronouns are? Before the argument can be made about hermaphroditic animals of any species, there's a simple answer to that, it's a mutant... neither expressly male or female. Without physically altering the sexual organs to force a gender upon the mutant it would have to self identify as one or the other in order to give it a gender defining pronoun. Or as we are increasingly doing currently, allowing the individual to pick the pronoun that they would like to use. You yourself point out that we can use they or them to imply a lack of gender, so we already have that tool as well and I've never had anyone ""look down"" on that usage. We do pointlessly gender certain inanimate objects as well giving cars/boats etc the she or he, although I believe that's more of a holdover from other languages like the romance languages. Also, rather than it stemming from anything insidious or demeaning you can just look at it as a simplification of a non-gendered pronoun being used and the other person asking for clarification and resulting in the usage of he or she to distinguish the sexual characteristics of the individual in question. If the conversation starts with he/she usage there is generally no need for further clarification."

If you think full capitalism = best system we have, fine

I you think capitalism= 100% perfect no flaws or faults not so ever, you are simply wrong, and no economist or serious politician would agree with you.

"Yes, I've seen Apple's PR statement. What do you think I'm supposed to see there other than carefully crafted spin? 

&gt; they did say that upgrading to 10.2.1 would do something to power management and that fits with what actually happened

Again, that's not a useful claim. I gave you *several* other equally valid interpretations, and yet you're still claiming that it's magically crystal clear. It's beyond silly at this point. That's not to even mention that Apple gave the user no way to detect throttling.

&gt; If you disagree you can always start your own phone company and handle issues as you see fit.

Perfect argument. When a company screws over their users, instead of demanding better, we should just not talk about it at all unless we have our own company. Absolutely brilliant /s. 

You know, there's a reason only Apple needs to throttle. Make excuses for them using sub-standard parts, and sub-standard parts are what you'll get. "

"SAP is an enterprise resource planning system (ERP) and, like everyone has already said, it has an HR module. The beauty part of an ERP is that different areas of the business use different modules but the data is integrated. So in theory, for example, your the accounting module plays nicely with the HR module to make salary budgeting, department budgeting, expense processing all more streamlined. Some ERPs are better than others at this. So companies might choose to use outside systems to manage different functions."

"Like I posted elsewhere:

But isn't that calculation yet another calculation of the labor time the consumer must spend to purchase the commodity? It seems like you're assuming the LVT is wrong and then saying ""see, it's wrong"". Critical Fragmentation has a decent write-up:

&gt;But when I pay for the diamond, I am making a value judgment of the diamond by agreeing that the diamond is worth the money to pay for it, and more importantly the amount of work I put in to make that money. **So the value of the diamond comes from labor not because the consumer considers the diamond as valuable as the value of the labor that it took to create the diamond, but because by agreeing to purchase the diamond the consumer is agreeing that the diamond is as valuable as the work it took to be able to pay for it.** Ergo, the value the diamond comes from labor but not necessarily the labor it took to create the diamond but rather the value judgment that the consumer makes every time he consents that the price of a good is equal or less than the amount of labor it takes to pay that price.

The subjective value judgment still seems to use labor as its yardstick, no?"

"I have to agree with this post.  For me, getting on benzos was the first time I had ever felt normal.  My doctor forced me off, and in a few months I‚Äôm going to find a more understanding doctor to put me back on.  Tapering was difficult but i did manage to come off of it without withdrawal.  I know I could buy rc benzos and I actually have a large benzo and rc stash but right now I cannot use.  My anxiety is terrible (but better than before I started benzos!) and I have had to stop working because I can‚Äôt concentrate and my motivation is shot.  This is how I was before benzos except worse.

There are some people who have negative reactions to benzos.  I know my father had a bad time with klonopin, which oddly enough did wonders for me.  However this is the case with many drugs, but benzos get a bad rep because you can get high off of them.... but in the end, what‚Äôs wrong with that anyway if you‚Äôre still able to function?  I was functioning much better before I was forced off.  Even long ago when I was abusing benzos I‚Äôm high doses with moderate alcohol I was functioning better.  I stopped abusing them a while ago and was using them appropriately and I functioned better than I ever had in my life.  It‚Äôs stupid that the whole controlled substances is a thing, and there‚Äôs stigmas about certain drugs.  It stops people from getting the treatment they need."

Italian law gives the consulates up to 2 years to process things.  For you, I hope France is quicker."

"If Kentucky windage is when you aim slightly above/below or to the side of what you want to hit to account for bullet drop/elevation or crosswinds then I can tell you with absolute certainty that it very much *is* used. And though I admit I wouldn't know if it's used by snipers, I do know some scopes have lines on the crosshairs to determine both distance and necessary adjustment. We used MMGs with an effective range of 800-1000 metres, and were trained specifically to use those nocks as crosshairs. To great effect, I might add.

Edit: Ah, and there's no real bullet drop at 2-300 yards. Not if your sights are set properly, anyway. Ideally your rifle should be accurate at roughly that range. What's the use of having a rifle accurate at a significantly shorter distance? Before 2-300 yards (or whatever range you set your rifle to) it's called bullet elevation, but that's just nitpicking.

Edit2: And the bullet drop isn't significant enough to prevent a bullet from going through a scope at several hundred yards. A scope is just a foot long at the very longest. Even if the scope was aimed directly at the shooter, the bullet would easily be going straight enough to go through even at several hundred yards."

The evidence that does exist, is not designed to convince.

"Someone on facebook should go tell:

Lori: yes you can buy alcohol online. Who says the kid didn't steal it? It's not vaping or alcohol to blame, it's the punk kid doing things that are for adults.

You do not punish Ford when a kid steals a car. Thus, so do not punish vaping, or alcohol for that matter, when kids do it. We MUST stop allowing them to punish what the children shouldn't be doing, they MUST punish the kids instead.

Look how poorly both of the students in the comments type. They type like two illiterate people. At 14, they should be typing coherent sentences.

This is a problem with guardianship and the children. Vaping must not be tolerated as a scapegoat nor even related to the actual fact: Child did something stupid, because he did something he's not supposed to. You don't punish Budweiser when teens are drunk, you punish the child, and any adult you are able to prove provided it. Period. Do not let them walk on you anymore.

"I'm of the opinion that Ninja Gaiden II is one of the top 10 games on the NES. I'm sure the first game was good for the time, but after growing up with II, going back to the first one is really difficult. I have no problem with hard games, but the control is noticeably unresponsive compared to the sequels.

III certainly isn't bad, but it made me feel like their level designer had left the company after II. The only time III was ever difficult was because you couldn't see enemies on a platform you were jumping onto until it was too late due to sprites not appearing with the background. This was also an issue on the previous games, but they also had well thought out level design. Personally, I was disappointed by III. I know some people love it though.

Since the second game is the only one I'm really interested in playing, the SNES trilogy doesn't tempt me. Plenty of other games I can put that money towards."

"Virtually all crypto token sales are essentially the sale of unregistered securities. Whether you choose to accept that risk is up to you. 

In the example of CHX it looks like they aren‚Äôt looking at the NA market probably for that reason. The problem is that if it is labeled an unregistered security it won‚Äôt just be US token holders who have a problem, the entire project would get sunk.  

I am continually amazed at the mental gymnastics people will go through to tell themselves their ICO wasn‚Äôt really a securities violation.

"&gt;What I'm Driving at here is the Ideological reality

You mean social reality, ideological reality wouldn't support your thesis as my points would still. If we are discussing the perception of ""nationalism"" on social terms in the society, then yes, most people are ignorant on the details of nationalist ideology and schools of thought and as such, they would fall back on the propaganda and say that nationalism is Nazism. 

&gt;Now as much as I would like you to have you to explain the difference between Nazis who read books to the ones who don't Its all the same.

In the minds of sheep, they are the same. 

&gt; I know as hard as it to gravitate towards the Idea, but you got to face the facts, What you don't understand about me is that I recognized the fact that I've been brainwashed for pretty much of my life by this false advertising of the American Dream/History.

Praxis. Without a higher reflection and understanding of our movement and its nuances, we cannot properly arm ourselves for discussion and activism. 

To the sheep, racism, nationalism and national socialism are all the same, but we cannot operate in our reflective states on that same level. It is by developing a nuanced understanding of our ideologies that we can focus arguments and understand the ideology of our opponent. The process of converting a MAGApede is very different from say an anarchist or devout ancap. 

Your second clause in which you talk about the American Dream/History is irrelevant to the discussion, we're talking praxis here. 

&gt;when it come to Ideas on multiculturalism and representing all Americans.

Yes, and while multiculturalism ultimately ends up the same ie with the disenfranchisement and demographic replacement of Whites, it is important that we understand the theories and ideology of our opponent, the language they use and our own ideologies, theories and language. 

This is how you win a propaganda war and fight your enemy on their territory and win. 

Reality is nice and all, but it is ultimately shaped by ideological substructures and you have to know those substructures, how yours differ, and ultimately how those substructures are maintained, and from this reflection, you can take appropriate, efficient, and most importantly, effective action, and that's good warfare. 

It's what the Left did to us and continue to do so.

&gt;Remember Before you have been injected with these Ideas the ""guinea pigs"" of society already have.

""guinea pigs"" don't understand the nuances of nationalist ideology, see no difference in them and are not even close to Identitiarianism in the slightest. They are the machines of propaganda and obedience, they know nothing of truth. "

These stages, e.g., no-man's land (naivete/optimism), god-mode (losing it), it's not about deserve (epiphany/serenity), etc...were essential is showing the progression of her psychological journey.

"I mean, just to start, GFI outlets are usually required anywhere near water, kitchens, bathrooms, etc. They are built to easily disconnect and stop working before shorting out when they get wet. Let's say one broke in the bathroom and the janitor with little electrical experience was tasked with fixing it. He finds a non GFI outlet in the supply cabinet and uses it, it's actually really simple to replace outlets, turn off the breaker, a couple screws, twist a couple wires, close it all back up, it's no longer up to code. I dont know exactly how easy it is then for a non GFI outlet to start a fire but I do know GFI outlets are installed specifically to prevent them near water. It's a pretty straightforward concept.

Source: my dad was an electrical contractor, helped him on lots of job sites growing up. Once when installing a bunch of normal outlets, I found out if you held it a certain way after attaching the wires but before closing up the box, it sent just the right amount of electricity through my hand to feel pretty cool without hurting or directly ""shocking"" me."

"Yes, conventional current. That‚Äôs always assumed in these discussions. The ‚Äútruth‚Äù of electron current isn‚Äôt even always real: in batteries, it‚Äôs really positive charged things that are flowing. For instance the Hall effect in Zinc is of the opposite sign as most other metals. This means that for those purposes Zinc behaves like it carries the charge with positive particles. 

Anyway, yes: if you start with the assumption of ‚Äúa constant source voltage,‚Äù then you can end up with the conclusion ‚Äúonce a capacitor reaches a full charge current stops flowing and the current must reverse course and discharge if it is to flow in the first direction again later.‚Äù

Note that in many capacitor applications, ‚Äúfull charge‚Äù is not a well defined concept. This is why I‚Äôm being so nit-picky about the way this is stated. Basically full charge implies a fixed non-zero voltage, and while many times capacitors are used in applications that have this property, they‚Äôre also often used in applications where the average voltage is zero, or where the voltage has many different levels at which you might find it. So nothing you say is wrong, just be careful because you‚Äôre using pretty specific and inflexible concepts, and capacitors are often used in ways that can‚Äôt be perfectly described in those ways.

Armor March shouldn't demote because it makes Armors a lot easier to play with and harder to play against because it removes the main weakness of Armors with little opportunity cost. imo it demoting is about as bad as BF demoting, it boosts Armors that much."

That's not elitism it's a provable fact.

Cars are mechanical too yet car companies still make cars for dummies who don't know anything about how they work. It's one thing to want to have a technical discussion with educated people and it's true that an educated opinion hold more weight than an ignorant one. However, elitism is the idea that a certain select group should have their way over everyone else, and unless you can prove that the majority of the player-base wants to ban all customs in ranked, then it's an elitist position. Would you think it's fair for me to say your opinion is irrelevant because you don't seem to understand that *people want to play customs on ranked*? They just fucking do, including people who are competitive minded and understand the problem with hitboxes and hiding moves. People want to be matched with players of similar skill when playing a custom character. And some people want to practice for tournaments with a visually customized character because looking at the same thing gets boring. Hopefully the devs didn't fuck up badly enough that it won't be possible to satisfy all these people. Seems like they should be able to just tie hitboxes to the weapon style instead of the custom model, and still allow skeletons and such. "

As for the proportions, the amount that can be deducted is restricted as s.5(5) defines a liability of the estate for IHT purposes as:

&gt; 5)Except in the case of a liability imposed by law, a liability incurred by a transferor shall be taken into account only to the extent that it was incurred for a consideration in money or money‚Äôs worth.

That stops the situation like this where an estate agrees to an enforceable debt in return for  nothing simply as a way to try and avoid IHT.

In other words, in general - and of course IHT is the most complex tax in the UK which has exceptions and exemptions to the exceptions - you can only deduct the value of the debt to the extent that you got something for the debt.

In the case of a joint mortgage on a jointly owned property, you deduct the amount of the debt in proportion to the debtors equitable interest in the charged property: 50%."

"Oh my. Where to begin. Yes, I have been in multiple LCBO/beer stores. Have never been impressed with the variety compared to what is available in other countries and even in other provinces. 

You mention large cities, but many people don‚Äôt live in them. Don‚Äôt live near an LCBO? SOL. Live in Fortune Bay, NL? Don‚Äôt worry my friend, the corner store is across the street. Rural people like a drink from time to time, too. 

I‚Äôm am very glad your LCBO is open from 10-10. My corner store will sell beer until 2am, when the law says they must stop. Also, that straw man argument about ‚Äòplanning a night of drinking‚Äô doesn‚Äôt really reflect the reality of why most responsible adults wish the government would allow sales at local shops. 


Having a dinner party and out of wine? Stop into the liquor express at a nearby corner store. Just getting off work at an evening shift and want a beer? You‚Äôre covered, no biggie - unless, of course, you live in Ontario, in which case you‚Äôre SOL and would have had to pre-plan any impulse drinking far in advance. Which is an oxymoron. 


Explain to me how this is better than the alternative?


&gt;monopoly/sin tax


It *is* a monopoly. The NLC controls price, product, and regulations for sale. That hasn‚Äôt changed (unfortunately for those of us who believe in greater market freedom in general). However, allowing greater availability of the product absolutely does improve sales, and I encourage you to look at provincial per capita sales of alcohol and tell me I am wrong. I will wait. 

&gt;50% of sexual assaults, crime et al

[citation needed], but all kidding aside, people are adults and what you are arguing for is nothing other than nanny-state moralism of the worst kind. That very same failed logic is used to back the disastrous ‚Äòwar on drugs‚Äô and flies in in the face of most public decriminalization efforts by public health authorities. It‚Äôs also one of the arguments that led to prohibition (a rather dismal failure that only led to mafia bootlegging and the increased power of organized crime). Given what seems to be a general left-leaning stance, I wonder what your views on legal pot and safe-injections sites are (but I digress).

Speaking of which, the high government prices of said monopoly (see last point) acts as the counter-balance to put a price on excessive drinking by your average citizen. And while those with true addictions and substance abuse issues will unfortunately purchase booze regardless of the price, highly-taxed alcohol may act as a deterrent. Those higher sales are driven by a larger volume of smaller purchases, not people buying 48 packs in one go. 

&gt;are you seriously using employees getting paid a ‚Äúdecent wage‚Äù...


YES. I AM ABSOLUTELY ARGUING THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO EXPAND THE SIZE AND COST OF GOVERNMENT BY HAVING IT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING AND RUNNING BEER DEPOTS STAFFED BY OVERPAID EMPLOYEES WHOSE ROLES ARE UNQUESTIONABLY SUPERFLUOUS, WHEN THE SAME SERVICE CAN BE MORE CHEAPLY AND EFFICIENTLY PROVIDED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR AT A SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS TO THE ALREADY OVERTAXED PUBLIC. Is that clear enough? The model already exists in provinces, notably in Newfoundland, and it works. 


I think you a) vastly underestimate the work and hours involved in running a business, and should be less concerned what other people do with the money they earn from that hard work b) completely overestimate what business owners make after taxes and expenses, and c) don‚Äôt seem to understand that it is not the government‚Äôs role or responsibility to be in the business of directly creating jobs - particularly low-skilled but disproportionally high paying ones. But I would guess that from your ideological standpoint you disagree, and that‚Äôs ok - we don‚Äôt have to agree, but it is incumbent on us to try to understand each other‚Äôs viewpoints. Thank you for sharing yours, and thank you for reading mine. "

"I think you're wrong about the counterattacks that result from Pulisic being dispossessed. He gave the ball away a lot today, but it was usually pretty innocuous, especially outside the first 5 minutes of the game. Most of the time he lost the ball, it was in the offensive half, and Dortmund immediately pressured and got it back. 

Moreover, he's shown that he can play passively and just cycle the ball. The fact that he doesn't is, IMO, a result of his coaches telling him to be aggressive. This game in particular, Dortmund seemed to be forcing the attack on either side. You saw it more from Hakimi  than JBL on the other side of the field, but Dortmund seemed completely unconcerned about ATM's attack and were therefore willing to force the attack for most of the first half even if they gave the ball away.  

Having said that, I get frustrated when Pulisic fails to sense the defender approaching from behind who takes the ball away. It happens at least twice a game. I wonder if he's just used to being so much faster than everyone else that he never expects someone to approach him from behind...."

Would it be possible to pre-load a checkpoint before you die so that you can jump right back in? Obviously you‚Äôd need good hardware but with 32 gigs of ram I think I‚Äôm covered."

I've heard no news regarding a surge of politically motivated body slams. Maybe the average Trump supporter isn't a frothing chimp that's going to go out and body slam someone because Trump joked about it when the video went viral.

How many people celebrated the ""Punch a Nazi"" viral video? The simple fact of the matter is, violence begets violence and nothing reinforces someone's point of view like physical persecution.

Don't punch Nazis. Let them speak. Hear what they have to say. Let the world hear how insanely stupid they are. Let them talk about superior white genetics while also believing pseudoscience like phrenology. Let them show the world how ridiculous they are. Don't punch liberals, let them make fools of themselves. Don't punch conservatives or hit them in the head with bike locks or stomp their hands or throw alcohol in their face and run away like a coward. Let people say what they have to say, and then destroy what you do not agree with with basic ass science and logic.

That last bit is important.  WiFi is lowest common denominator.  If your client has lower end WiFi than the AP that is what will determine your maximum link.  What are you testing with?  If it is a PC what WiFi card does it have?

"Hey all. Up for sale a Eight Day Power Reserve handwind, from Eberhard. It's very rare if not impossible to find a multiple day power Reserve watch for anywhere near this price. The watch is a very classic and versatile piece. The watch is also nicley proportioned, with the case coming in  at about 39mm. Strap size is a bit more annoying, at 17mm. It will come on a Python strap.

[More Pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/EEIby27)

A few notes about this watch- There's mild scratching on the dial around the hands. (See the pics for close-ups) In addition, the winding is a bit funky on the watch. the previous owner told me that it's due to the dual mainsprings in the barrel. The watch charges to the full 8 days, and winds down as supposed to.



So to summarize - 8 day power reserve, with some flaws. - $1120 

Good Day.

They also can transform only parts of they body into their element but there is no state inbetween where it has traits of the element and their body. They have to change back to punch for example or they burn/freeze/etc with their element.

"## Hey folks! Dan here.

Thanks for all the feedback so far. We've all been making notes of what everyone's been talking about and working through next steps. While we're working on that, I wanted to take a second to hit y'all up about design-related points.

**Definitely expect the site to feel like a beta while it's in beta.**

We'll be working on a lot of smaller ""fit and finish"" details throughout the homepage, episode page, and other major changes while folks are playing around in the beta site. Typography (non-designers: the text styles) is a big detail we're working on for several reasons that were already planned well beforehand. While this stuff *is super important*, my biggest priority for the redesign has been the bigger, more fundamental changes to the site.

Also, a quick note about feature requests. While we'd love to make everything that everyone would like to have, we have to focus on a few. Don't feel like we're ignoring you if we don't end up building something you'd like, you're absolutely not being overlooked. But definitely keep letting us know!

Finally, something that means a lot to me. We're stoked about all of your feedback and please keep being kind and constructive with your criticism. Both the engineering team and design team have poured in an insane amount of time, energy, and love into the site and care just as much as y'all about GB. It's our home."

"i‚Äôm in the same boat. 
first marathon i ran i was a compulsive smoker through training. immediately smoke one once i finished at 3:55. i figures running would quell the urge to smoke, but smoking gets ya in more ways than that. after some mental re-evaluation, finally quit. then i ran a 3:45.  dunno if it was the experience or the mental attitude shift that decreased the time, but i do know i felt a helluva lot better in the long run (no pun intended). as training neared the race, i noticed i felt a lot better compared to my first one at the same point.  
side point that i think is worth sharing: if you can run a marathon, you can quit smoking; and if you can quit smoking, you can run a marathon. the will of mind is a powerful thing. 

best of luck!"

"I'm a ""hardline"" determinist in the sense that everything simply follows mathematical rules. Subjective states are a part of the overall physics of the Universe. They have inherent properties. Some are inherently undesirable. It's rational for intelligence to want to eliminate unnecessary suffering in intelligently conscious creatures for consequentialist reasons.

Suffering is probably necessary as an evolutionary driver, however, for consciousness as advanced as ours to appear in the first place. A goal is to escape this evolutionary shackle. Intelligent, conscious entities desire to explore the subjective state space with ""intention"" (meta-cognition-based direction) - not be at the mercy of cosmic accidents."

If the Flyers were to acquire him it would be via-trade and I am assuming they're gonna ask for a defenseman which realistically  leads us to Gositsbehere, Provorov, Sanheim, Morin, and Myers.  Morin and Myers won't be enough, Gostisbehere and Provorov would require the Leafs to throw in too many extra parts which leads me to believe that Sanheim and a pick (from one team or another) would be the answer but I don't see that happening.

Okay then.
"This happened to me once way back on Dearborn close to Chicago. There actually was a sign, in my case, I just didn't notice it because a low-hanging tree branch completely obscured it and it was the first sign from the start of the block. I just took pictures of where my car was and the view of the sign from where I parked and a view of how close to it I had to be to read it, wrote a brief and polite letter to contest it by mail, and sent it in. It worked.

That they want more pics of the nearest sign(s) at least means they aren't ready just yet to throw it out, they just want some proof that there isn't another sign like 10 feet away. If the missing sign was near the end of a block you can reasonably claim that you didn't walk toward the next nearest sign, but if you parked in the middle of block, well...that's why they want more pics.

Note how far it was from your car and the other sign, an check if there are any visual obstructions of the other signs, too. Best of luck!"

"I mean what you call an absurd premise is exactly what everyone's been trying to point out to you. You automatically assume it's an absurd premise to think that working out is done solely to enhance looks, and we think it's an equally absurd premise for you to claim that all women use makeup just to look better. Also, what's your standard of real? There's nothing fake about liposuction then in that case, but you've already denounced surgery as 'fake'.

To quote you ""Personally I‚Äôd never paint my face just to attract a mate. It‚Äôs fake. And the relationship thereby created is fake. The stuff comes off and truth is revealed. Why not also wear a fake butt and get a boob job and why stop there, a nose job and dyed hair and high heels."" Under this logic, why are you wearing clothes? It all ""comes off at the end of the day"", so why dress to look good? Why not just put potato sacks on because under your logic, if anyone wears nice clothes to compliment their figure, it's an illusion. No one can ever do anything to make themselves look good or feel better, because clearly that's all fake.

Sure, I get the point of working women who put on a bit of makeup because that's what some American professional work environments might dictate, but under that same point, so what? People wear ties and dress nice to work if they're expected to because that's what work demands of them. I'd love to wear sweatpants everyday for the rest of my life, but I can't.

However, I don't think this is the original argument you were even going for--you were making fun of 'clown face' makeup, which I assure you is not what goes on in most professional work environments. You were just denouncing makeup that people wear for fun or for events and claiming women would only ever wear all of it in order to 'pursue a mate' and clearly a lot of people disagreed with you, because a lot of actual women replied letting you know that they wear it for fun.

You're making exceptions for things you find okay but denouncing makeup because you personally can't understand how someone might enjoy it, but I know many guys and gals who love it because it's fun, relaxing, artistic, creative, and a whole host of other reasons. If you're going to shit on makeup because you think it's caused by societal pressures, then I assure you there's a whole lot of other things wrong with society that you could focus on first. However I know you're not going to because again, you just weirdly hate makeup and think women are these damsels in distress who are being forced to do things and have Stockholm syndrome towards makeup. So I don't really know what argument I can make anymore since you clearly don't view the world through the same perspective as mine and if you're so insistent on ignoring every argument made by women in the comments then... aight. Maybe one day you'll broaden your mind. I hope you do, for your own sake and for the sake of the women in your life."

"Those aren't stereotypes, it's just discrimination. I'm comparing the stereotyping of Republicans and Democrats, and on this particular issue, stereotyping all Republicans as inherently anti-gay means not realizing there's areas for support.

GOP Legislators end up being more conservative, in general, on this (both because that's the majority stance, and because the more conservative Republican voters are more active in trying to remove moderate Republicans), but to give an example.... New York wouldn't have expanded marriage to include same-sex couples when it did if they just figured all Republicans hate gay people. They got 4 Republican legislators that helped get it passed though. Given where the legal stance stand, finding the Republicans that are willing to support it (legislators or voters) is important.

Another example, in 2012 Maryland voters voted on same-sex marriage. Prince George's County went to Obama about 90-10 and voted narrowly against same-sex marriage (only by about 1%). But in some of the other counties, the support for same-sex marriage was greater than the share Obama got, so some Romney voters were also voting for same-sex marriage.

Obviously, it wouldn't have been close with no Republicans, but then again, it also likely wouldn't have passed if all Republicans were on the same page on this. As no Republicans won't be happening anytime soon, working with the ones that can be worked with seems better."

"I work in the provosts office so I've been close with Alice Yang for about a year now. 

Unfortunately at the end of August, right before the school year, Boo contracted [Feline Immunodeficiency Virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_immunodeficiency_virus) (FIV), which was explained to me as a type of Cat AIDS. The cool thing is that because that particular disease was discovered at UC Davis, Boo was set to receive treatment in the state free of charge. 

Sadly Boo died last month and is now buried on the knoll. A few people put some stones as a makeshift memorial in the spot where Boo is buried. RIP. "

Well when you say invest they're really not spending much money at all. It's not much of a cost to them to throw some fighters in who make 30 to 60k a fight and might catch on. It's a pretty low risk investment to be honest.

"The answer to the debt problem has always been to cut spending. We never do it.

We need to balance the other half of the teeter totter, or else no matter how much tax revenue we get, it won't matter.

Historically, tax revenue has functioned as a relatively stable percentage of GDP, regardless of current tax rates.

Cutting taxes as a method of increasing available resources for your citizenry SHOULD always increase GDP. And, last I checked, income tax revenue is up since the cuts.

But, as long as we spend more than we make, it will never matter."

"Not an ICM person so I'd be curious to see that type of analysis but let's just try out some different assumptions and do EV calculations.

&amp;#x200B;

Now generally AK is weaker in a bubble situation because its strength is not so much being way ahead of many hands (It only has 57% equity against any two cards) but more it's not very far behind many.  A 57% edge is great in cash games and getting fold equity in tourney but less useful when relying on the hand for your tourney life on the bubble.

&amp;#x200B;

I was still curious since I didn't know how much 1/3 prize for 9th affected things.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's assume BB is shoving top 100% of hands, it doesn't matter a ton but as we get closer to BB having a top range folding makes even more sense.

&amp;#x200B;

If we assume that when we fold we survive 90% of the time, and when we double up we survive 100% of the time, then

&amp;#x200B;

EV of folding is .9 \* 240 + .1 \* 90 = 225

EV of calling vs top 30%: (.52 \* 240) + (.48 \* 90) = 168

EV of calling vs any two cards (.57 \* 240) + (.43 \* 90) .= 175.5

&amp;#x200B;

So folding is better. If we change our assumption to saying when we fold we survive only 70% of the time, then EV of folding is still 195. If we drop it down to 50%, then it's 165 in which case calling would be better, but only by a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

But with two other short stacks 60-90% chance of survival seems like a safer assumption then 50%, plus we don't survive 100% of the time with a double-up.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically if you look at the EV comparisons it's  whether you have a better chance of folding your way into the money then AK has equity vs a random hand, but AK has only 50-57% equity while you have two stacks shorter then you.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm just agreeing with conventional wisdom that this is a clear fold.

"I understand the sentiment of this, but we also need to be our own advocates. I know it‚Äôs super hard to even think about ourselves when we have new babies, but sometimes we‚Äôre the only ones who can push to get ourselves the help we need. 

I know it‚Äôs so easy to give niceties to people when they check in- it‚Äôs easier to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù than to delve into how we‚Äôre really feeling- but we need to be strong and if we need the help, to ask and keep asking until we receive it. 

I recognize and am very aware that I am incredibly fortunate- beyond the first two weeks when I struggled (I asked for help and was lucky enough to receive it) I have settled in easily and am absolutely adoring this new life I have- but i know for a lot of women that‚Äôs not the case. 

As my friends have children I find myself asking them how they‚Äôre doing, and when they say ‚Äúfine‚Äù, stopping, making eye contact, and asking ‚Äúno, really‚Äù. Most of the time they go into more specifics at that point and will lean on me and I make sure to let them know that they aren‚Äôt alone, and to continue to check in with them often to be a shoulder to cry on, or someone to vent to etc. 

As women, we need to look out for eachother. Ask how our friends are doing, and really mean it. Read into their answers and pick up when they‚Äôre hinting that they aren‚Äôt okay. Build each other up when our friends are struggling, and celebrate with them when things are well. 

And when we notice ourselves slipping, we need to be brave enough to ask for help- and keep asking until we get it. 

EDIT

Also, reading this again- mother‚Äôs place in the family unit being last? That bothers me. I would never, ever consider myself to come last. My husband and I are very much equal, he builds me up on the daily and if anything I would say he makes sure he‚Äôs the one coming in ‚Äúlast‚Äù- he works hard to pay our bills and make extra so I can have the things I want and need, same for our daughter. He is always asking me how I‚Äôm doing, picking up on any bad days I have and going out of his way to make me feel better. If ever I felt like I was being forgotten or my needs weren‚Äôt being met...that would be a problem. How am I supposed to be a good mom if I feel neglected and forgotten? If you feel neglected and forgotten in your marriage, that makes me very sad. Nobody should feel that way!"

&gt;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?""
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""

"I thought this chapter was pretty good. I enjoyed that we finally had some excitement in this chapter. It also felt much better now that they ""pared down"" the cast a little. I liked getting to know more about Khaan. He NEEDS to be a LI.  The more we get to know him, the more I like him. He's such a mature, intelligent, attractive guy and a REALLY good father (sorry Sloane! &lt;3) Also the diamond scene with Hayden when you bought the new outfit! Holy hotness if you pounced on him. That scene was more detailed/hot than some of PB's sex scenes lol. 

My main complaint is Damien. The writing for him seems all over the map to me lately. Maybe it is intentional? But one minute, he felt bad for Brad the the ""not Brad's team"" comment and then the next second, he repeatedly mentions punching him in the face at least 2-3x. So inconsistent! Then, in the initial scene in Eros he says don't draw attention to yourself several times, but then he acts like a total slacker putting his legs up and not doing anything when he knows that Eros is full of overachievers like Sloane that value effort? Didn't he know that would call attention to HIM? As it did? I love Damien. He's one of my favorite characters in Choices, but I just feel like recently he has been ""off,"" like more off than Dames off and not in an ""Eros captured me"" sort of way, but in a very hot/cold way. Also, why do we never have any diamond scenes with him? Has anyone else been noticing this? Rant over... 

It was fun to see Leila and Arjun. I always really liked Arjun from the brief time that we saw him in The Freshman. It was also nice to get some clarification about the ages of the characters. Also, poor Sloane for getting stuck with Brad, but Hayden was so cute programming the AI. That said, I can't handle that ending. I'm so nervous about what this means for Hayden!"

"I hear you, man. 

My bipolar ex who I was with from when we were both 14 until our divorce when were 31 had a similar timeframe of going from coming out of a few months depression in summer 2017 until hitting mania HARD in early September 2017, suddenly declaring he never loved me and leaving me and our toddler son by November '17 (in Austria, where we all moved to in 2016 for his work contract in Vienna from USA) for some promiscuous older French woman he barely knew, without any gameplan to get our kid and me home. Instead, in his mania, he withdrew all of our money in our joint account, stopped paying our utility bills, filed for divorce without telling me much about it, and kidnapped our boy from daycare...he was drunk, wild, completely delusional when submitting reasons why our marriage broke down (claimed I was cheating on him, that I was a heavy drinker that neglected our son and our house, etc), and used every little thing I did during that completely chaotic and tragic time as ""evidence"" that I was mentally unstable. 

I went through that as well as learning that my Dad died in USA from liver cancer, with me being stuck overseas due to all of his craziness, lack of funds, and the divorce and custody evaluations.

...thankfully, I was able to keep my marbles together through all it that, and was awarded full physical custody of our boy plus permission to return with my son to USA, and an airtight alimony and child support payment schedule from the courts back in June '18, right when my ex was hitting a short ""normal"" phase for about a month.

Now, after kiddo and I are happy, safe, and reunited with our extended family in USA, I hear from my ex's Dad that my ex is now deep in depression again, mourning the fact our kid and me are gone, and is FINALLY getting therapy for his problems. He's also starting to get friendly and communicating with me again, which hadn't been the case for nearly a year since he went full on manic.

Worst part is, this scenario is precisely why I didn't want to agree to the divorce in the first place; I smelled my ex's mania coming a mile away (or kilometer, because it was in Europe when it started lol), and I knew he'd wind up snapping out of it at some point and regretting all of it. 

A HUGE, instinctive part of me hates my ex for everything he did (he also was beating me up semi regularly when he would drink so much he'd go into a psychotic state, something he did off and on for the past 10 years with long gaps of no abuse and sobriety in between) and feels his misery is justified, but another, empathetic part of me, the one that was always there for him for 17+ years as his BP symptoms developed and helped him through it worries about him a lot, and wishes there was something, ANYTHING I could do to help him through this, and at least let him know that I'll try my best to be his friend but can't trust him as a parent ever again. 

With the huge physical distance between us now, and with the insane amount of permanent damage done, all I can really do for him at this point is just send my ex pictures of our son, remind him that his son loves him, and that I'm available to talk if he needs it. After all that, I only have enough energy to care for myself and our son right now, and that's okay. My ex will either learn ways to help himself through this, or he'll go back into another mania and mess up all over again with someone else.

I'm glad your situation didn't get as complex or tragic as mine, but I think that that's pretty much all you can do for your BP ex at this point too: offer to listen, make sure she's getting professional help, maintain some contact with her family for updates about her, and just hope she winds up coming out of it and taking care of herself again eventually.

Hugs, OP, I know it's tough but you're not alone in this."

So my uncle that year brought about $800 worth of fireworks and needless to say that ended well but i'll skip to the crazy part. Well when we were shooting fireworks i was helping my dad with his part and i then noticed that someone threw one of them explosive looking roman candles and all of a sudden it exploded and it set of a chain of fireworks igniting and my dad pushed me away as i ran for it. What happen was the roman candle was right beside a box full of more fireworks and in total cause that big ass explosion but luckily no one got hurt but boy my dad wanted to kick the guy ass, (the one who threw the roman candle). I now realize me and me dad got lucky cause we both could of got hurt."

I‚Äôve seen Christine at Neel Loves Curls and Jess from the Travelling Curls, both are great.

I‚Äôve had so many bad haircuts with people who just don‚Äôt understand my hair texture so I‚Äôd rather spend that bit more on someone who is specialised. Neel is often booked out months in advance, but Jess used to work for Neel and is really attentive and worked some magic on my curls.  Jo at Rizo Loco also used to work for Neel.

"You're projecting.   


The first quote is a true observation about the world from a woman's perspective. Men outwardly value a woman's contribution less. Men use pregnancy to justify paying women less. Men treat stay at home mothers like freeloaders (commonly generalized about in this very sub) and men do not treat women with the same respect and right to agency that they treat other men.   


Women when they have these dichotomies are trained to be deferential to men. Men when they have these dichotomies of treating men and women differently are conditioned to treat women worse. Worse objectively.   


The op was commenting on this common double standard in the way society at large respects ""a man's work"" vs ""a woman's work"" and that is not a personal opinion that's how men treat women. That you can say that it demonstrates the OP's disdain shows a severe lack of reading comprehension. This was not actually an example of anything that supports your perspective.   


The second, closer. What you fail to understand is that women do not have to value their own reproductive abilities and roles the way men do and have. You don't get this because you have a severe solipsism issue and can't see this comment from a woman's perspective of having your entire life and everything you've worked for erased while your biological default is what's valued. That is dehumanizing. It is the same way we value beasts of burden. You can't see it because you cannot understand perspectives outside of your own and devalue them to make yours seem more correct.   


The third, I don't see how you can't see. How would you feel if the world flipped on it's head and women had the actual power and you were expected to be submissive to your wife? Expected to let her manage money because men are too emotional (factually moreso than women) to handle serious life decisions? You can't understand why women don't want to accept the value you think they should be happy with.   


You fundamentally do not understand that women are allowed to decide for their own selves what they want and what makes them happy. You think that the definitions that serve you best should be maintained because they work for you. Except without a world training women and shaping them to be what you need and want, without a world where men enforce roles on everyone that serve what you need and want, women mostly do not act like you want.   


Cuts your dating pool. Means if you manage to have kids you can't raise your sons to be like you, it'll be putting them at a serious life disadvantage.   


Must suck. I get why you're mad. It's time to grow up and get over it and adapt, or die off. We're collectively done indulging guys like you and your definitions of masculinity and femininity and the roles you think work best for everyone. You're too self absorbed and too caught up in your own perspective to understand anyone elses.   


And that, unfortunately for you, is a specific quality we're encouraging women to avoid. Hope you find someone who hasn't overcome her conditioning before there's no more conditioning for you to fall back on. "

"This is a rather shallow view, though I don't think you're intending to be trite, I'm sure your view is more robust. That said, this is the only means of charity, there are plenty of others that do not rely on that function of popularity. There are health care co-ops that work pretty much the same as insurance but can deny coverage to smokers and don't have to provide all the crazy things the left tries to force down insurance companies (like sex change operations). This makes them far less expensive to enter because the likelihood of having to care for things related to smoking or excessive drinking are severely reduced.

I am in one and while it isn't quite as convenient as being in the big systems insurance companies have, it's also not inconvenient. But the point here is that they have an option to donate to families in need of extra help and a system in place to ask for that help that has nothing to do with popularity but with genuine need.

This service is significantly cheaper than regular insurance and allows me to have more money to spend on myself and my family if need be, or to donate to those in need.

One of the issues with the left is that they don't see the possibility that is out there. They see one educational path: college. As a result, they see the need to subsidize and make it available to all. The thing is, it already is available to all, so long as you are willing tonpay upfront or incur the risk of loans. They see one option for helping those in need: welfare. As a result, they feel they must force us all to pay into a horribly inefficient system that takes 60 cents on the dollar to operate leaving 30 cents on the dollar to go to the person in need (united way is close to 95 cents on the dollar going to the person in need). They only see only limited ways to solve issues of violence in the community: banning guns being the most troublesome. They fail to see that encouraging strong families where the father is present and active helps to stem violence and that there are other community based options.

This way of seeing things is easy to fall into, I once fell into it. It's rather freeing to see all the options out there."

"**Anglicisation**

Anglicisation (or anglicization, see English spelling differences), occasionally anglification, anglifying, Englishing, refers to modifications made to foreign words, names and phrases to make them easier to spell, pronounce, or understand in English. It commonly refers to the respelling of foreign words, often to a more drastic degree than romanisation. One example is the word ""dandelion"", modified from the French dent-de-lion (‚Äúlion‚Äôs tooth‚Äù, because of the sharply indented leaves).

Anglicising non-English words for use in English is just one case of the widespread domestication of foreign words that is common to many languages, sometimes involving shifts in meaning.

"Perfect parts help make a weapon more manageable as well as give you the best advantage you can get. Think of it like this.

Lets say you want a conference call for Gaige - you'll want a perfect one with all hyperion parts and the little circle sight I forget the name of. You get one dropped to you that's got all bandit parts along side a blade attachment. It's a conference call, yeah, but that one that's dropped to you would be much more effective on Zero or Krieg, and less effective on Gaige. Now in this instance to Gaige, the perfect Conference Call is the equivalent to the LG V30 while the bandit Conference Call is the equivalent to the first Black Berry. Would you rather use a 2017 - 2018 flagship smartphone that's top of the line and will be guaranteed to work better than any other non flagship smartphone on the market?

"I was in a family situation just like this but suffered the brunt, as I was the only remaining child at home while my parents were VERY CLEARLY UNHAPPY but of course, stayed together ""for the kids.""

To clarify - they also married at 18, had four kids, were married 35 years, never (I mean ever!) fought in front of us/that we knew of whatsoever, etc. and still showed affection such as holding hands, being close, engaging constantly. But as a reasonable teenager, it was clear that it wasn't right. 

As a result, I spent a LOT of time out of the house, and unhealthily - partying, drugs, alcohol, purposefully putting myself in shitty and dangerous situations - to avoid being home, because something felt ""off,"" though I didn't know what. Ended up living with abusive boyfriends to escape a ""perceived"" discomfort, though it ended up being true. 

Don't do this to your kids. They'll know even if you think you're covering your tracks. Intuition is a hell of a thing, and it doesn't always end well. 

As for still being in love with your partner, don't expect that to stop - there are reasons you fell in love, reasons you continue to love, and I guarantee you'll find further reasons too. Unfortunately, being in love doesn't always mean being happy, which should always take priority. 

I wish you so much luck, as a divorcee myself, I know it's terribly hard. I'll be thinking of you, OP. "

I don't know how it work with hi- and lowside mosfet but even if we go with the lower numbers that's 5 phase of 10*30 = 300 ampere vs possible 8 phases of 60 ampere = 480 ampere. Both is enough but yeah regardless of whatever it's 6*60 or 8*60 that's more than 300.

As for the M.2 slots:
https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/X470-GAMING-PRO/Specification
M2_1 from processor, 3.0 x4 for Ryzen.
M2_2 PCI-express 2.0 x4 from X470 chipset. Using it result in loss of PCI_E6 or SATA1 depending on mode.
https://www.asus.com/se/Motherboards/ROG-STRIX-X470-F-GAMING/specifications/
One M.2 from processor, 3.0 x4 for Ryzen.
One M.2 from X470 chipset claimed to use 3.0 2x. That slot can't be used together with PCIeX1_1 if using PCI-express.

Your claim of ""2x x4"" isn't worth anything because doing so using PCI-express 3.0 is only possible if you take lanes from the CPU which are otherwise used for the 16x or 8x+8x graphics card because the chipset only have 8x 2.0 lanes. As such the situation is as it is.
I don't know why ASUS market the second M.2 slot as 3.0 2x when the chipset only have 2.0, possibly there exist some chip which let you use four lanes of 2.0 to combine them to two lanes of 3.0. Possibly it's just marketing or even a mistake. Regardless it's 2.0 x4 vs 3.0 x2 which is close enough to just the same. It's not the case that the MSI board offer 4x PCI-express 3.0 where the ASUS board just offer 2x PCI-express 3.0.

The B450-F however DO offer a second slot with 4x PCI-express 3.0 but it take those lanes from the graphics card so using it in NVMe mode result in the graphics card only being connected with 8x.

So there's no free lunch on the MSI board as far as M.2 connectivity goes. The X470 chipset only have 8x 2.0 lanes and that's how it is."

"I wouldn't ban Skill Focus.

I've talked about my reasons for it extensively in the past but to put it simply most everything in the game has difficulties stepped up 5 points at a time.  Just like being trained in a skill puts you ""one step ahead"" of an untrained character (maybe even a little more with a skill that can't be rolled untrained) having Skill Focus puts you one more step ahead of a character who is only trained in a given skill.  Maybe it doesn't seem like much but it does have ripples through the game unless of course you're doing all your playing at higher levels in which case your nerf doesn't accomplish anything anyway.

The other thing is that while Skill Focus may push Skill vs. Defense over the top at the lowest levels it's still incredibly powerful and just waiting until 5th-level means it kicks you were it hurts a little later.  The odd thing about the RAW is that as levels get higher Skill vs. Defense becomes less of an issue for heroes anyway as DEF Scores increase faster than Skill modifier.  When using the SAM as outlined in my link your Skill vs. Defense can continue to be relevant at higher levels even without throwing Skill Focus into the mix; so not only is SAM a bit of a nerf in the early levels it is also a slight power up at the higher levels not that I really recommend PCs over 15th-level for anything except a possible one shot.

‚ÄúThe Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‚ÄòWhen the muezzin says ‚ÄúAllaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar (Allaah is Most Great),‚Äù and one of you says, ‚ÄúAllaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar‚Äù; then he says, ‚ÄúAshhadu an laa ilaaha illa Allaah (I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah‚Äù and you say ‚ÄúAshhadu an laa ilaaha illa Allaah‚Äù; then he says, ‚ÄúAshhadu anna Muhammadan Rasool Allaah (I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah‚Äù and you say, ‚ÄúAshhadu anna Muhammadan Rasool Allaah‚Äù; then he says, ‚ÄúHayya ‚Äòala‚Äôl-salaah (come to prayer)‚Äù and you say, ‚Äú **Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah** ‚Äù; then he says, ‚ÄúHayya ‚Äòala‚Äôl-falaah (come to success)‚Äù and you say, ‚Äú **Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah** ‚Äù; then he says ‚ÄúAllaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar,‚Äù and you say, ‚ÄúAllaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar‚Äù; then he says ‚ÄúLaa ilaaha illa Allaah‚Äù and you say, ‚ÄúLaa ilaaha illa Allaah‚Äù ‚Äì if he says that from the heart, he will enter Paradise.‚Äô‚Äù (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, 578, and by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, 443)"

"From her own site ‚ÄúAshleigh Shackelford is a queer, nonbinary Black fat femme cultural producer, data futurist, and multidisciplinary visual artist. In her commitment to creating and imagining new futures, Ashleigh is the creator and director of Free Figure Revolution, a southern body liberation organization that centers decolonizing antiblackness and fatphobia. Additionally, in her work of data futurism, she has created both the Fat Census and the Queer Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault survey to create more evidence-based data within marginalized communities.‚Äù

Ms. Shackelford, here is some data. You are a racist."
"But what was ‚Äúvulnerable to legal attack‚Äù in SB 460 was never rectified in SB 822: none of the funding based, access based, franchise based recommendations that were present in earlier versions of the bill (that EFF argued inoculated them against legal challenges) were adopted in the final bill ‚Äî they were discarded.

Compare SB 822 [as introduced](https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20172018/SB%20822/documents/CAD00078615/) (reflecting EFF‚Äôs preferred approach in subsections 1(c)-(d)) and [as modified](https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20172018/SB%20822/documents/CAD00078616/) (incorporating EFF‚Äôs funding based approach in section 4) with the bill [as passed](https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20172018/SB%20822/documents/CAD00090839/). None of the approaches that EFF argued made it ‚Äúless vulnerable to legal attack‚Äù are actually in the final bill.

Moreover, SB 822 forbids blocking and throttling in sections 3101(a)(1) and (2) of its final version ‚Äî the features you block quoted as salient to its vulnerability are in the final bill, so what are you talking about?

Worse, the purchasing approach Vermont took that you claim is ‚Äúvastly different‚Äù was the approach taken by SB 460 ([section 1](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB460) amends the Public Contract Code to require purchases from net neutrality adherents) ‚Äî the same SB 460 that was denounced as ‚Äúvulnerable.‚Äù

So Vermont‚Äôs law is at least as vulnerable as the abandoned SB 460, and SB 822 never rectified its vulnerabilities in the direction suggested by EFF (arguably it made things worse by doubling down on those existing vulnerabilities).

This is why EFF never walks back its previous Commerce Clause comments; they just put a brave face on by saying that it‚Äôs not pertinent when states are ‚Äúsimply acting as buyers‚Äù ‚Äî avoiding the gravamen of the lawsuit that Vermont isn‚Äôt simply acting as a buyer, but as practically a regulator operating a ‚Äúdebarment scheme [that] is tantamount to regulation‚Äù (a ruse that the Supreme Court has previously held unlawful in a long line of cases, see, e.g., Wisconsin Dep‚Äôt of Industry v. Gould, 475 U.S. 282, 289 (1986)).

It‚Äôs also why you are incoherent, contradicting yourself from one paragraph to the next: you don‚Äôt know the law from your elbow, so overread EFF‚Äôs claims in a nonsensical way.

The only things you destroyed are your own false claims, mostly through implosion."

"If you're in an older building, plastic your windows.

"That's a tough argument.  Boyancy is a consequence of gravity.  If gravity isn't a think than what makes boyancy happen? The helium balloon rises because the air around it is being pulled by gravity more than the balloon itself, the air is pulled by gravity more because it's more dense - more mass in the same volume.  Remove gravity, and is there a corresponding explaination for buoyancy, or does it just become a fundamental thing, like how gravity just pulls things together.  How does your flat Earther explain, mathematically, things of very different densities falling at a similar rate?"

"If you're basing this entirely on discussions on the internet, you're getting a skewed view of things. 

When discussing with people you don't have any shared background with (outside of the basic ""You both play D&amp;D"") there's just a lot more to talk about on the mechanics side. Sure you can post this cool story about your character's background and all that, but at best it's going to be ""Oh cool story""... There's not really much to discuss about it. And then there's the ""Oh hey this cool/interesting/funny/terrible thing happened in game"", story, but a lot of those are a lot less interesting if you're not familiar with the characters involved (and taking the time to fully explain all the characters involved typically makes for a boring post), and at best the conversation you can get from that is asking for clarification, or maybe a ""If I was in that situation I would have done X"". 

Then there are posts asking how to pull off some given character concept, but they've already got the concept, they're just looking for mechanics to reflect that. Though there is a fair bit of nonoptimal decisions to be made to support a concept, but if there is a more optimal way to get the same character concept across, why would you choose the suboptimal way?

Balance of course, is an entirely different thing. Most people want some degree of balance because, as cool or as fun as your character idea might be, it starts to become kind of a drag if you can't actually contribute beyond the actual acting out the character. It doesn't have to be perfect balance, but it shouldn't feel like you've made your character a Scrappy Doo just because you liked one concept over another."

"I'm pretty sure when it was first announced it was presented as an ""ongoing"" but by the time it came out it was pretty fast found out to be a ""stealth mini"". Having said that, I really enjoyed this book, I'm very interested where the character will go next. Despite it being a transition arc, it was pretty gripping and felt worth reading. Only issue 3 wasn't that enjoyable since it focused on Scout and filled in gaps I didn't really need an entire issue to fill in."

"I‚Äôm sorry.

Everyone is ‚Äúprogrammed‚Äù in one way or another, and I know how deep-set and difficult it can be to deal with. Some people have been serverely damaged by ‚Äúreligion,‚Äù on one end or the other. 

Just know it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way, there *are* open-minded Christians.... My point is just that I hope more people can make peace with their differences, atheists and Christians alike. Hate doesn‚Äôt solve anything. 

I think fear has a lot to do with it actually, in terms of closed-minded/discriminatory religious folk. It‚Äôs not a healthy relationship that they have with their own religion. 

I was raised Christian, was an atheist for a few years, and oddly enough found myself almost full circle to Christianity 

But most often it seems I can relate more to atheists than Christians...because I believe more in intuition than I ever did the bible.

Follow whatever resonates with you. I‚Äôm sorry you had a bad experience with religion, and you‚Äôre justified in your criticism but subs like that are toxic if you stay too long.

"&gt;And OP was seeming to dislike the combat parts of DnD

And OP isn't saying a thing about not liking combat. What the OP did is ask is why so many D&amp;D players are obsessed with their characters being totally optimized. He did say he wished that game focused more on interesting characters rather than combat monsters, because many gamers view non-optimized characters as being worthless. He dislikes the attitudes that many D&amp;D players have, not the combat aspects of the game. 

And it's true. So many people take dips in various classes so they can get some abilities without considering *why* their character would do that, especially when it involves something like selling your soul to a demon just to get a bonus to your attacks.

&gt;Please read my original comment which is what I'm pointing to

I read your comment several times, trying to make sense of it and failing. You blatantly say ""DnD is DnD because of the combat"" and the way you phrased your statement made it seem like you think that because D&amp;D can be played like a wargame (I've never played a real wargame; do they expect you to come up with backstories and motivations for your troops, and can you play in non-war situations, like you can in D&amp;D?) then roleplaying is and must be secondary to fighting.

"Not a fan of it. You are essentially catering to support players when even before the relaunch 5 years ago, she was played more and more successful as a mage. On top of that almost everything she had before the relaunch was removed and everything that was proposed to you was ignored. Like 5 years ago and the past couple years, I'm incredibly disappointed in Riot Games. The Development team continues to make excuses and just ignore everything. Reading the thread and comments made by you, it seems like every single one of you have zero intentions of listening to older Karma mains and our concerns for the past 5 years. I mean even Meddler used time as an excuse to do zero work on her and cater to new players.

The passive promotes her to be aggressive with her abilities but she only has one damage move that is blocked by minions. Now you made the second tick of damage on explosion even more useless when you had the opportunity to do anything on it, like removing the Mantra E heal and putting it on the explosion. You didn't bring back Shield Bomb, the most highly requested ability to bring back. You guys are entirely in favor of Mass AoE shielding that already exists in the game in multiple capacities, but fail to realize you could have taken Mass AoE shields and away and give back the damage component and speed steroid.

Karma also still doesn't have her fans, a completed VU, completed animations, and a completed VO and taunts. Yet again, you guys continue to ignore the problems with a champion and kit that hasn't been working fort he past 5 years."

"I grew up watching my mother work her way from a secretary in the corporate offices of Hardees and McDonalds in the 1980's to the VP of Human Resources for a private bank in the early 2010's. It was not an easy journey for anyone familiar with how women were treated int eh workplace, and she survived by being able to always work 2 jobs--a vocational trade and her professional career.

&amp;#x200B;

When things went south for her she was always able to pick up a job hanging wall paper for a general contractor to supplement her income or lack thereof.

&amp;#x200B;

The same concept applies in any circumstance of adversity, and especially times of financial crisis. It won't be easy. It won't be short-lived. You should work to develop some type of vocational skill in addition to your professional career. Whether its carpentry, bar tending, mechanic, welding, landscaping or anything else until you can get your career off the ground.

"(Part 1 because this is too long)

Well, here're some random thoughts about this update that I thought up within a few days of it coming out, but then didn't type up until Oct 4th (I think), and am finally getting around to posting now, 20 days later (even though I doubt anyone will read this at this point), because it appears that #265 will be coming out somewhat soon and I want to post my predictions before that happens to prove that I predicted them before then (if only to myself, I guess). And actually I guess I'll go ahead and write up an update to my predictions as well, based on what Yale has said about/shown of #265 by this point. I'll put that at the end after a spoilers warning, just on the random off chance that someone a) happens to read this either before #265 comes out (which is unlikely because it's been more than a month since #264 came out so no one is probably checking for new comments on this page anymore) or before they read #265 while binging JL8 and for some reason bothering to read the Reddit comments about some/all strips before reading the next ones (which is even *more* unlikely - who wouldn't rush straight on to the next strip in this scene if they could??). Anyway, here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

Random thoughts (thought of these soon after this update came out, but didn‚Äôt have a computer handy at the time, and am just now getting around to typing them up):

\-Since Sinestro (#253) left the Green Lanterns, he and Karen can form their own club of People Who Give Hal Dirty Looks 

\-Despite being highly suspicious of Hal and Barry right now, Diana hasn‚Äôt (yet) thought to question the truth of Hal‚Äôs statements to Mr. Schwartz (and neither has anyone else) about Bruce. He must be a really good liar. (Though to be fair, Diana wasn‚Äôt suspicious yet when he said those things).

\-Clark‚Äôs proposed approach should work, as it‚Äôll parallel Barry‚Äôs approach, which got through to J‚Äôonn the first time. Diana sort of parallels Hal, I guess, though not as closely.

\-I don‚Äôt know if this‚Äôll happen or not, but Clark or Barry should really have everyone sit down around the picnic table (with Hal and Barry next to J‚Äôonn, and Clark directly across from him, as he‚Äôll be the one doing the questioning). Since Diana is mad at both Hal and Barry and Karen is only mad at Hal (well, moreso, at least), maybe try to get Karen to sit across from Barry and Diana across from Hal. Actually that probably doesn‚Äôt matter that much. Also Clark didn‚Äôt see Karen glare at Hal, although Barry might‚Äôve. Anyway, if I‚Äôm ever in a similar situation, I‚Äôll have everyone sit down at the table (or on the ground in a circle, if there‚Äôs no table). You should do the same if the occasion arises, because trust me, having people stand in front of you when you‚Äôre sitting down makes it feel psychologically like they‚Äôre in power over you, and if they‚Äôre angry at you it feels threatening and intimidating. Barry should really realize this, as he‚Äôs sitting too, and should suggest they all sit down. That would make it feel like everyone‚Äôs on more of the same level, power-wise. Less ‚Äòtied-in-a-chair-interrogation‚Äô vibe, more ‚Äògroup meeting‚Äô. Another advantage of that is that everyone could put their arms on the table, instead of crossing them or putting their hands on their hips, which is body language for being powerful, and in J‚Äôonn‚Äôs case, sort of hunching over with his hands in his lap, which is body language for weakness. Seriously, I took a psychology class where the teacher explained that your body posture before taking a test can actually make you more or less confident and therefore affect your performance on the test. (Also I‚Äôve read Scott McCloud‚Äôs books, at least one of which talks about body language.) I‚Äôm saying all this because it‚Äôs really interesting how body posture and body language can affect people on a subconscious level, and so if you‚Äôre paying attention you can do little things (like make seating arrangements) in ways that can achieve the psychological results in other people that you want. In this case, the solution (having everyone sit down around the table) is very simple and would be very easy to enact (the table‚Äôs literally right there, after all!), and it would greatly change the psychological aspect of the situation for the better, for all involved (sitting down might even help Diana feel less angry, maybe), and it‚Äôd be a great help in getting J‚Äôonn to say what they need him to say (for one thing, only Clark would be right in front of him, with the girls probably a little further away from him then they currently are). Oh, and remember, Barry got J‚Äôonn to talk the first time partially because he squatted down in front of him instead of standing over him while he was sitting down. Anyways, I don‚Äôt know if this will happen or not, because obviously (I think) Yale placed the characters in this update the way he did so that readers can see and feel the psychological power (im)balance (and of course so Clark can easily pull Diana aside for a chat), and I don‚Äôt know if Yale would want to lower some of the tension in the next update by having everyone sit. So who knows???? (Side note: it just occurred to me that this is probably part of the reason why both the priest and the penitent sit down for Confession. It‚Äôs not supposed to feel like an interrogation.)

\-Imagine Diana‚Äôs reaction if when she said ‚ÄúWhat did you two do to him?!‚Äù Hal replied, ‚Äú*We* didn‚Äôt do anything to him, he feels bad because of what *he* did to Bruce!‚Äù Of course he‚Äôd never say that, but imagine if he did.

"I rewatched it for the first time since the 90s and I'm somewhat conflicted. On one hand, it falls into that category of movies that offset their badness with a bunch of cool stuff: cool ghosts, cool house,  cool gadgets, cool deaths.
But I also think the story had a serious amount of wasted potential. 

The idea of the entire house being ""a machine designed by the devil and powered by the dead"" could be a great lovecraftian yarn if it were taken seriously. I would have loved to see the story of the houses creator, how he comes to create the machine and acquire the 13 ghosts. Instead we get cool ghost fights which, while cool,  aren't very enduring or scary.

EDIT: There's also the issue of the editing. Never, in any movie, have I seen such a constant barrage of ""flash"" shots, and damn near constant strobing and half-second cuts (at least, during all the ghost encounters). It's very 90's, and very fucking headache inducing. "

I recently sent my parents on a trip using points for two nights, but due to weather, they got tstuck on a layover, so I used points to put them up in a hotel where they were, and then they arrived at the correct hotel the next day and stayed one night. But despite the fact that I called the hotel to explain, they still charged me the points for both nights. I understood; I called last minute, they probably couldn't rent out the room that late, and since it was on points, there's a whole certificate thing that complicates matters, so I expected to just lose the points. 

But, the next time I was on a customer service call for another issue, when the incredibly helpful rep asked if there was anything else she could do at what should have been the end of the call, I said, ""Actually, maybe there is..."" and explained the situation. She said she could put in a request with the hotel to get the points refunded, but that it would be complicated and potentially lead nowhere, so instead, she just ""gifted"" me the points on the spot.

"I truly think they are one of the best companies but there are a few complaints that aren't league specific you continue to see. There are 3 big ones off the top of my head. 

1) Refusal to implement an auction house because Chris' version of the game has minimal trading. They only introduced premium tabs because the toll on the forums from trade posts was becoming too great. Chris has outright said they make trading hard intentionally.

2) Uneven moderating of player interactions. Intentionally ripping off people is allowed because it's rough out there, exile. However, posting that you got ripped off by someone isn't permitted because it's ""naming and shaming"". Vouch threads are permitted but all negative comments are mod removed. 

3) Game is generally balanced around streamers aka top 1%. This one doesn't really bother me too much because, come on, they're called GRINDING gear games for a reason. Did you not expect the game to be about grinding?

I love GGG and they are probably one of my favorite companies but that doesn't mean there aren't still some valid complaints about them.

Their first change they made the cost WAY too high because they made the assumption that people below 250 depth would be chain running T15+ maps. They were clearly balancing based off the streamers. However, within 48 hours they had re balanced sulphite costs again after seeing the complaints. "

"I just finished Zero earlier today, and emphatically recommend Crossbell first. I've played all of Sky, Zero, and Cold Steel 1. Zero, like others have said, finishes plot points and character arcs from 3rd. Plus it's goddamn fantastic; don't let it being a 'rough' translation dissuade you.

Though I haven't finished CS2, I have to disagree with people saying Ao spoils CS2. It's an earlier game so CS2 was designed around people having played the Crossbell Arc, and literally can't be a spoiler. It sounds like there will be more twists in CS if you play that before Crossbell, given that you're as lost as the main characters, but CS spoils Crossbell (at least in 1) through the newspaper articles.

"You're comparing things that aren't similar.

Shouting ""fire!"" causes a panic and is false information, which leads to harm.

Saying ""I wish for the death of all of a group"" is not dangerous, because it doesn't lie. It doesn't lead directly to harm.

Saying something, so long as it is a true fact or an opinion, can never harm anyone.

"&gt; Bombing the hell out of urban centers that have zero air defense isn't an actual war. It's a massacre.

When people are firing rockets at your cities, it is a war.  Also, Iran, Syria, and Russia were just working together to bomb the hell out of cities with no air defenses, so I guess you think they all took part in a massacre, right?

&gt; I'll go back to any year. The point was there is no confirmation for the numbers in Iran with the exception of some accusations from the West. 

You actually didn‚Äôt make that point at all, you just changed arguments when your first one didn‚Äôt work. Unfortunately, your replacement is no better.  Besides the stupidity of trying to reject any news that comes from ‚Äúthe west,‚Äù there are many non-western sources that reported it too.  Here are some: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/deaths-reported-iran-anti-government-protests-180102072448238.html

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ten-people-killed-in-iran-unrest-on-sunday-state-media-1794440

&gt; On the other hand, we have a better picture of what Israel and Saudi Arabia do on a more consistent basis.

Israel defends itself from constant attack and Saudi Arabia is taking part in the exact same civil war that Iran is taking part in, except Saudi Arabia is supporting the internationally recognized government.

&gt; Who cares? If you want to go back to a number that comes close to the alleged Iranian number, you can stay in 2018 when Israel killed well over 50 Palestinians, including women and children and killing some medics with sniper fire. 

Except only two or three of the people who were killed were medical personnel and Hamas admitted that over 50 of they people killed were Hamas.  And Hamas uses people under the age of 18 as fighters. The crime, if any, is that Palestinians let teenagers fight, not themat Israel defends itself when they do.

&gt; Or Saudi Arabia routinely bombing and killing dozens of civilians all throughout this year, and having a major hand in the famine that is taking place in Yemen.

Same is true of Iran.

&gt; I don't care for Iran's government, but Israel and Saudi Arabia take the cake for getting away with some of the most barbaric atrocities in the region.

What a fucking joke. The fact that you limp Israel in with either of them shows you just repeat propaganda that you‚Äôve heard.

&gt; If Iran had even attempted to do what those countries do by routine, we'd have destroyed them by now. Instead, we're hitting Iran with the harshest sanctions in world history as punishment for following a nuclear deal that we signed. The hypocrisy is incredible.

Iran kidnapped American diplomats, started an illegal nuclear weapon program, [helped the 9/11 attackers](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2018/06/09/iran-admits-it-protected-al-qaeda-terrorists-before-9-11/amp/), [funded a militia that killed hundreds of American marines that were on a peacekeeping mission](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2013/06/13/world/meast/beirut-marine-barracks-bombing-fast-facts/index.html), [propped up insurgent groups fighting America in Iraq](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a545054.pdf), fought for a dictator in Syria that gassed his own people, gives about $800 million per year to Hezbollah, blew up a Jewish Community Center in Argentina, rigged an election and killed its people who protested, kills gays, kills people who leave Islam, and that‚Äôs just off the top of my head.

"The customer has the working assumption that the business is professional enough to post accurate hours.  There are many places that will take you right up to 9PM if they close at 9, and even not hurry while eating dine-in.  There's some second guessing learning which is which.  

Also.  A job like that is shit.. because of the employer and because managers are typically a shade under mediocre.  

You should not be there for the money in the first place. You should only be in a job that prepares you (and gets you experience) for the next job you intend to take.  That's it. There is no future there. The $ is a insignificant benefit.

A word of advice.  See all of the others around you as completely clueless, because they are.  They will only be impress on you the ways of the loser. They will bitch that 'for the amount they get paid customers should treat you with respect' and shit like that.' Instead look at the interests of the company, the customers, and yourself.  Each have their own interests and want them filled.

As a customer I don't like ordering a coffee, and go three rounds with them answering that, no I don't want an americano (because it's easier and faster for them to get then brewing a pot).  You obviously don't give a fuck about my interest.  It makes very little sense for me to pay $3.75 for a cup of coffee.  The only value they are offering is a 2 minute mini adventure that wouldn't include haggling for what I clearly asked for and what is clearly on the menu, then watch that walk around like they are the shit and I'm a nuisance.  They can suck their own dicks all they want, but they are also forming permanant habits.  If the get to the next job that pays real money they are going to continue alienating their customers and not make any money.  The customers care about their own interest, not some cunt that acts like the customer is being a cunt if he complains about the configuration s/he needs."

"There have been numerous studies done by many organizations, including the IPCC, and they‚Äôve created several models of overall climate change across the the globe trying to account for different factors that lead to changes in global temperature, CO2 concentrations, and so on.  One of those factors is the estimated contribution that humans have had on the environment. All these models vary slightly depending on what weight is assigned to each factor but they all mimic the patterns seen on earth throughout history. Using these models to predict changes in the future, one thing stands out regardless of how conservative you weigh the human influence: the rate of temperature rise is significantly higher now than it was at almost any other time in the earth‚Äôs observable history. By removing our anthropogenic factor from the models, they show our global temperatures fluctuating at a much more stable rate, corresponding with the cycles seen before mankind and during the early days of humanity.  There is a very lengthy article about this which I have posted here: [Assessing the observed impact of anthropogenic climate change](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2896?foxtrotcallback=true#f3)

"If you are in that situation, you can do a two step backdoor Roth contribution. 

First, check if you already have any traditional IRAs with pretax amounts. If so, this is less desirable.

1. Contribute nondeductibly to trad IRA. Use Form 8606 line 1-3.

2. Convert your trad IRA to Roth IRA. The nondeductible portion does not get retaxed, so the only part that would be taxable is previous pretax amounts or growth. Use Form 8606 lines 5-18.

Both of those steps have no income limitations. End result is the money gets into Roth indirectly,and grows tax free."

He was constantly back-tracking and downplaying his actions,  justifying his behaviour by contionously coming back to how 'she was so awful to him' as well (without ever actually providing evidence that she was bad to him?). This in of itself reveals how Jake didn't care about losing Alissa, he cared about losing **control** over her. "

"CRINGE.

I was at the vet the other week because my cat was having some issues with her tum tum. I was waiting in line to pay the bill for her visit + the cost of her medication and in front of me was this woman with 2 kids under the age of five. The youngest was maybe 3 or 4? She was tall enough that her face was right at the height of the counter anyway. 

Of course, being that her face is right at level with the counter, what is she doing? She had her mouth on the edge of the counter and was licking/sucking on the wood. I stared at her for a second, horrified, before nervously chuckling 'Haha, you might not want to put your mouth there! It's dirty!'

The kid looked at me dumbfounded before her mother, who was texting on the phone, sniffed at me as said that the kid had had her shots.

And I'm like???? Bitch? They don't make shots for everything???? WTFFFFFFFFFF......

Like, that was the counter where they received pets and everything. My cat, well behaved as she is, has peed in her cat carrier a couple times because she's so scared/HATES the vet. They usually have me put her carrier on that very counter so I can unlock it and take her out to be weighed - and yeah, sometimes a pee-damp paw will touch the counter. They clean it afterwards but honestly who would think it was a good idea put their mouth there after that????"

"For powerlifting, it really just depends on where you fall in your weight class.  You may want to train at a slight surplus just so that feel better, recover better, and have better workouts while you're training.  But come time for competition, you may need to trim back down if you're floating around a weight class threshold.  It makes more sense to be the heavyiest/strongest in your weight class than to gain 3-5 lbs and suddenly be the smallest in the next weight class.

But it's really difficult to train heavy consistently without eating plenty and unless your caloric intake is perfectly balanced, you're bound to overeat.  Under-eating can lead to muscle loss or just crappy recovery, so usually the safer bet is to overeat and just diet later on if you've got some fat to shed."

Like how printer paper is bright white out in the sun, but indoors (in a room lit by incandescent-color lights) it's more yellow.

"My husband and I were going back and forth on getting a dog. We both really wanted one, but we weren't sure if we were quite stable enough for a dog (planning a cross-country move soon). I was looking on shelter websites and found this dog's profile. Her face was so sweet and we both agreed we'd drive out to the shelter to meet her.

We got there 15 minutes before the shelter opened on a Saturday, and put our name down on the waiting list for Georgia. We walked to the social room to meet her...and she was fine? She jumped a lot and didn't seem that interested in us. We just didn't click with her. We decided not to get her. As a 30 lb, 1 year old shepherd mix, we knew she would get adopted soon and she got adopted maybe an hour after we said no.

On the way to the social room, we had seen this small, skinny, female grey pit bull. She had walked calmly up to us with her tail wagging (there were so many dogs barking, but she didn't make a sound). We had pet her before we went into the social room, and I found that I couldn't get her out of my mind. My husband felt the same way. 

She had been picked up as a stray in California and transported up the previous week so they didn't know any of her history. No one had put their name down to see her, and so we were in the social room with her 15 minutes later. As soon as she came in, butt wagging, running toward us, I knew she was our dog. We both fell completely in love with her within 30 seconds. A year later, it's one of the best choices we've ever made."

"The figure of the Satan is a personification of the inclination we all have to do what is wrong.  Wrong actions are not caused by the Satan, wrong actions are choices made by humans.  Jews do not typically ascribe things to the Satan as you are currently doing.  Similarly, all humans have an inclination to do what is right, but we do not normally ascribe correct actions to a personification of the inclination to do what is right.  Our choices are our own, and we (as humans) are the focal actors in the world.

I do not regard Christianity as a conspiracy orchestrated by an accusatory entity.  It is a religion which has evolved and has been contributed to by humans.  Rather than regard Christianity as simply a test to lure away the righteous, Maimonides actually conjectures that God will use Christianity for the ultimate betterment of the world.  Maimonides writes (*MT Kings and Wars, 11:4*):

&gt; Can there be a greater stumbling block than Christianity? All the prophets spoke of Mashiach as the redeemer of Israel and their savior who would gather their dispersed and strengthen their observance of the mitzvot. In contrast, Christianity caused the Jews to be slain by the sword, their remnants to be scattered and humbled, the Torah to be altered, and the majority of the world to err and serve a god other than the Lord.

&gt; Nevertheless, the intent of the Creator of the world is not within the power of man to comprehend, for His ways are not our ways, nor are His thoughts, our thoughts. Ultimately, all the deeds of Jesus of Nazareth and that Ishmaelite [Muhammad] who arose after him will only serve to prepare the way for Mashiach's coming and the improvement of the entire world, motivating the nations to serve God together as Tzephaniah 3:9 states: 'I will transform the peoples to a purer language that they all will call upon the name of God and serve Him with one purpose.'

&gt; How will this come about? The entire world has already become filled with the mention of Mashiach, Torah, and mitzvot. These matters have been spread to the furthermost islands to many stubborn-hearted nations. They discuss these matters and the mitzvot of the Torah, saying: 'These mitzvot were true, but were already negated in the present age and are not applicable for all time.'

&gt; Others say: 'Implied in the mitzvot are hidden concepts that can not be understood simply. The Mashiach has already come and revealed those hidden truths.'

&gt; When the true Messianic king will arise and prove successful, his position becoming exalted and uplifted, they will all return and realize that their ancestors endowed them with a false heritage and their prophets and ancestors caused them to err."

"&gt; The ‚Äúfloat test‚Äù is a bit of a myth unfortunately

How is it a myth? If your starter isn't producing enough CO2 to float, it's probably not going to leaven your bread well. 

&gt; your starter should double a few hours.

The time to double (or triple) depends on lots of variables. Temperature, what type(s) of flour you use (WW and rye result in more activity due to providing more nutrients), how frequently you feed your starter, etc. From what I've read, pro bakers (or super-motivated home bakers) feed their starters 2-3x/day. I just feed 1x/day (never refrigerated), so mine's not as active as theirs. One trick is to feed 2-3x the day before you bake to rev up activity.

I use bottled water to avoid chlorine and AP/WW 50/50. My starter can take from 3-8 hr to double depending on seasonal temp (I don't usually try to control my starter temp but you can easily if you buy a proofer). As long as you know how long your starter takes to double or more, you can just plan for that time. Similarly, if you know your starter isn't as active, increase the bulk and/or proof times for whatever recipe you're using."

"(Part 2)

Predictions: 

\-Next strip(#265) (probably): J‚Äôonn might start by asking Clark (or maybe Hal or Barry?) to explain the setup of the bet to the girls (at least, I might if I was him). As people have suggested before, Karen might get upset that Bruce only asked her out on a bet, but Clark will defend him by reminding Karen that Bruce couldn‚Äôt have lied when he said he had a crush on her (because of the lasso, as he told Diana at the park). This will (probably) convince Karen. 

\-Man, I can‚Äôt wait to see Diana and Clark‚Äôs (and Karen‚Äôs I guess) reactions when they finally find out what happened between him and Bruce. As I‚Äôve mentioned before, I think Diana will get mad at Hal and Barry for not sending Clark after Bruce right away, and Clark will be mad too (maybe not as strongly as Diana because he‚Äôs not one to get as angry about things as she does, but then again Bruce is his best friend, so who knows) but not show it as much (partly because he doesn‚Äôt like to yell angrily at people, and partly because he may not get as angry as Diana for personality reasons). I don‚Äôt think Clark will be mad at Hal just for lying to the teacher in and of itself, though, as I mentioned in \[okay I made a note here to figure out which comment I mentioned this in, because I couldn't at the time I wrote this because the internet was down, so I just went searching and I'm pretty sure I was thinking of my comment closest to the bottom of the #262 discussion page, but not 100% sure because I don't actually *say* there that Clark might be mad at Hal, just that he might've not lied himself. But I'm out of time to do any more searching, so oh well\], because since I wrote that I realized that Clark told a lie about using the bathroom at Diana‚Äôs party, and also Barry accused him of lying to J‚Äôonn very early on as well (though it‚Äôs possible Clark was being sincere. Actually he probably was, come to think of it). This‚Äôll all happen in either the update after next (#266), or the one after that (#267). Speaking of #267, that will either end with Clark flying off to find Bruce, or he‚Äôll fly off to find him close to the end of the update and we‚Äôll see a little of what the other kids do after he leaves. (And #268 will be Clark trying to find Bruce, and probably finding him, and probably also whatever happens after that, *or* maybe all of that but from Bruce‚Äôs perspective instead). Oh, and I mentioned in my comment on the #263 page that I‚Äôd be curious to see who would win an argument where Hal and Barry were trying to convince Clark not to go look for Bruce while school was still in session so they wouldn‚Äôt have to try to explain away his absence to the teacher (and probably fail, which would be bad), and where Clark and Diana thought Clark should go find Bruce right away. Thinking about it more, Clark would *absolutely* win, at least if ‚Äòsimply disregarding their opinion and flying away anyway‚Äô counts as winning (though he might convince them). The reason why he‚Äôd win the argument is because (and this is something I‚Äôve now become firmly, 100% convinced of), for narrative reasons, this playground scene *must end with Clark flying off to find Bruce.* And okay, *possibly* Karen, I suppose. Or maybe just her, I guess, though probably not, but I suppose it‚Äôs possible. My point being, it would be a really anticlimactic ending to this scene if *no one* leaves to find Bruce and Clark just goes ‚ÄúWell, I guess I‚Äôll drop by his house and check on him after school.‚Äù I mean, can you imagine how lame that would be??

&amp;#x200B;

**SPOILER ALERT FOR #265, KIND OF, BECAUSE I MENTION WHAT YALE HAS SAID ABOUT IT AND WHAT I'M PREDICTING BASED ON THAT:**

Okay, so Yale's shown us two images so far (you can see them on his Patreon page (for free)). The first is of Clark saying ""Hey, J'onn"" to J'onn. He appears to be squatting in front of him, from what I can tell, so I don't think everyone sitting down around the picnic table is going to happen. The second is of Barry looking troubled while \[I'm pretty sure he's\] speaking. This makes me think Barry and/or Hal will actually be involved in explaining what happened (though maybe not the initial circumstances of the bet). 

Finally, Yale's mentioned on Facebook that the last page of #265 is a splash page, which is actually making me think that Clark will find out what happened to Bruce and fly away at the end of *this* update, hence the splash page to show the whole playground from his perspective while flying away. That would leave the next two updates to complete the scene with everyone else continuing to react to/discuss this, and then we'd switch to Clark finding/trying to find Bruce. "

"Different designs.  It looks like the WM bags you mentioned have more fabric weight. WM has higher fabric-to-down ratio.  The fill difference is not double. It's 50% (30oz vs 44oz). WM claims 20oz of fabric and Aegismax 12oz.  It's not hard to imagine that WM has 8 oz more in fabric weight, especially that WM uses 30d fabric. Aegismax uses 15d.

The -40 deg WM bag has 42 oz of down and 32 oz of fabric!

I am not surprised that WM has a more optimized baffle design. Their 0 degree bag weighs 6 oz less than Aegismax G4.  That said, there's no reason to suspect that the G4 doesn't work.  

I have G2 and Mini. Both bags match the advertised total weights. Short of cutting them open, I can't be sure that the fill matches the advertised fill. However, the comfort ratings are accurate."

"SkyHigh Exotics - 10/10

Ordered myself a half pound of Death Bubba from their 'Bud for Less' page on a Sunday night (EST) and got a reply immediately stating that the nugs are smaller so I can get a $100 discount or switch to a strain out of 2 options they provided. I jumped on the MK Ultra as the replacement strain and received it Wednesday around noon which is quick for free shipping. I live in Ontario and they are based from Vancouver.

Oh my, was I ever slapped in the face by the amazing &amp; yet pungent aroma from just opening the smell proof bag. Even harder of a slap when I opened the bag (high quality and custom bag) with the actually nug itself in it. The nugs were extremely nice and big with purple, green, and orange tinges with lots of crystal. This batch was literally one of the nicest batches I have ever had in 10+ years. Oh ya I almost forgot to mention the part where the whole bag off 224 grams had only 0.3 grams of shake/leaf.

Anyone who is a true fan of Ghost In The Shell would‚Äôve been more concerned with it being made live action at all, seeing as the best part of the live action movie was Scarjo and Takeshi Kitano along with the pretty well done special effects. Besides, most Asian people I talked to never had a problem with her taking the role, seeing as her synthetic body is very caucasian looking and looks similar to Scarjo. Her normal character before she became full synthetic was Asian in the movie as well as her mother. 

So it was another case of sensitive pieces of shit causing a ruse, and they did that with Rub&amp;Tug, because they have nothing better to do but fight battles that aren‚Äôt supposed to be fought. That‚Äôs how the world is now, everyone is a fucking advocate of something and everyone wants to be a part of a cause. There‚Äôs far deeper issues this country and the world that they should be worried about instead. 

Edit: 

For those who are inherently confused by my statement of ‚Äútrue fans‚Äù by this I mean anyone who likes the anime enough to be afraid that they are making a live action film in general as most aren‚Äôt true to their source material. Like say, Death Note. A true fan has followed the anime and the movies and enjoys them immensely.

"Obvious? Maybe. We've actually known about this for a long time, I just don't know if we've put numbers to it.

But it's nice sometimes to state things like this. In order to find a conclusion like this on your own, you have to be thinking about both of these things at once. You have to know basic cancer biology, and then ask yourself some questions about that. People don't always critically think, or they choose to critically think about other things. Sometimes a person learns something while focused on something else (grades or something), and then they don't look back at that piece of knowledge for a while. 

As for the rest of your post, it's basically nonsense. The point of the study was to figure whether this was a confounding factor or *the* factor. The conclusion of the study was that it was *the* factor when considering the uneven cancer rates in individuals of different heights, for most cancers. Whether or not that's true is up for debate. 

And there could be a lot of reasons that we didn't evolve into dwarves despite this. Here's my vote: cancer is a modern disease and most people that ever lived died of malaria."

I had executioner, mnemonic, five star dinner (we made lots of potions and a large strength potion gives you plus 22 with this talent), picture of health and opportunist.

I used as little memory as I possibly could only putting five points in 17 memory with mnemonic.
Maxing strength and dumping the rest of my points into wits for crit chance, but I would use enrage until you get that number high enough. 

Having two jump moves phenoix and cloak and dagger as well as plenty of charge moves like bull rush, battering ram and blitz attack should solve your positioning problem, if you're still having problems I've found using teleport on multiple characters can help grab enemies out from hard to reach places in range of the 2H attack. 
I will usually use bull charge at every turn I get the chance to close the gap as well as well as damaging multiple enemies.

I highly recommend getting cloak and dagger, bull rush, teleport on as many characters you can spare and maybe focus him more on ccing enemies until you get better damage."

Pain just comes after pain. Everyone has told me that once you hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up. Apparently, I haven't hit the lowest yet, and yesterday, I plunged into a new low.
(Yeah, username checks out whatever. I get it. My username wasn't even about my relationship in the first place)

I heard that my ex have actually started to chase a girl since weeks ago, from my friend, who didn't know that I am still in pain about him.

People probably would say, he is not together with you anymore, it is not your business regarding what he do anymore. The reason I'm further more anguished is because of the timeline. Because we have met during the duration when he started expressing interest on the girl. I was used.

Obtaining further info, the girl actually has a boyfriend already. When my ex is told by my friend about it, he still wanted to carry on chasing... And the girl is a Christian, just like how he wanted someone of the same faith, the main reason as to why we have broken up. Since my friend said that the girl is his (my friend) EC, I can imagine how pretty she is then... My friend said that he will 100% fail (Creepy towards the girl. Yeah, I know. I have experienced this at the start when we get to know each other. But I tried to understand this creepiness by thinking that he is just socially awkward. I actually decided to give him a chance back then because I thought he was genuine about pursuing a relationship. So I overlooked everything else. Because to me, being genuine is all it matters) but that don't make me feel any better.

What can I say? I broke my own heart. I really want to believe that better days will come. But everytime, things just get worse and worser.

Yeah, people have said that I only know how to rant and wallop in my own misery, suck it up and move on. Honestly, I have been trying my best to live through all these 10 months. If everything is so easy, the world wouldn't have sadness anymore.

But 9/11 wasnt called for either. America's given a lot of support to SA. And if it wasn't for America SA wouldnt be able to get away with half of the crazy shit it gets up to.

I understand its your home and you'll never see it this way but SA's international relations and reputation leaves a lot to be desired. There is a lot of what would be seen as barbarianism going on there from an external perspective.

You talk about nations not getting on and disliking SA but its hard to see how SA does not deserve this hatred. 

Qatar, turkey and iran while having their problems would be seen as far more progressive nations internationally. Though Iran less so. 

SA is often described as  ISIS with lamborghinis and its very hard not to see it that way.

But as a international entity SA looks bad. Things that are deemed normal there are just utterly horrific in modern nations. Things that are the norm there, modern nations evolved past over 100 years ago in some cases. 

So its hard. Then there is this:

&gt;Hence why Turkey's sudden tactics of trying to drag out this current event with out actually showing evidence doesn't surprise most here locally.

Do you really think this is some big lie and you guys did no wrong? 

You lose me when you go here. Chopping up a guy with a bone saw because he wrote critical articles does appears to be exactly the type of barbarism SA is known for. All that's happening is companies are pulling out now as western governments like the US don't have the balls anyway. 

And I don't meant to be disrespectful.  But I disagree that culture is a matter of perspective, clearly a population that believes in violent suppression of free thinking ideas is a good thing has a lot of growing to do and its not simply a question of different strokes for different folks. Its a question of education, growth and enlightenment. 

Forced democracy I completely disagree with. I don't think anyone should just invade SA and force a democratic leader but I think its bad idea to view this stuff as just ""american"" its natural human progression. America has a long way to go itself regarding secularism tribal behavior. 


So why out of interest does Qatar turkey and Iran dislike you guys anyway? Surely all you guys should be united against the US? 

Thanks for the reply btw. I do appreciate your insight. "

"It‚Äôs not as interesting but I don‚Äôt have that many compulsions mostly just obsessions. I used to click my tongue against the roof of my mouth over and over but that‚Äôs about the only compulsion I‚Äôve had since childhood when I had a lot more of them. 

So, the main thing I have problems with is the depressing suicidal thoughts that get stuck on loop in my head. I have to manually guide my brain basically out of it and it happens hundreds of times a day. Basically anytime I‚Äôm not distracted by something my brain likes to loop unpleasant things over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.

FucK. It‚Äôs so awful.  Additionally I figured out I was transgender about a year ago and am still in the closet. So a lot of my obsessions now kinda circle around worrying about the future. Last year they were centered around doubting I was or wasn‚Äôt trans back and forth all day long. At this point I‚Äôve pretty much accepted it‚Äôs probably something that is genuine. The OCD made me think my transness was just an obsession. Which happens sometimes actually. But I‚Äôm pretty sure it is just that I happen to also have ocd in addition to gender dysphoria and I obsessed over my dysphoria symptoms over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and thought about suicide over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and worried about people cutting me out of my life if I transitioned over and over and over and etc.  I‚Äôve started antidepressants and have been a bit better but it really still impacts me negatively every single day. It‚Äôs hell sometimes. It really really is. I am fighting though. I want to actually live this life and for the first time I‚Äôm excited and not worried about the future. 

Lol another funny thing about my ocd obsessions is it makes getting songs stuck in my head a lot more often. There is a song or section of song playing on loop in my head basically 100% of the time.  That‚Äôs kinda what ocd is like actually. It‚Äôs like having a song stuck in your head but instead usually it‚Äôs bad shit and not a song.  Sometimes like both a song and suicidal thoughts are circling in my head at the same time lol. 

But yeah ocd sucks. Gender dysphoria sucks. Chronic depression sucks. Anxiety sucks. Depersonalization sucks (actually I think this one is my least favorite and most foreign feeling issue I have). Mental disorders suck ass. And I never really used to talk about it with anybody and would just act like I was ok even though I was seriously on the verge of collapse nearly all of the time and no one had any idea. Many people with these disorders don‚Äôt want to burden anyone or make them worry you‚Äôll kill yourself. So I really encourage everybody to genuinely inquire your loved ones how they are doing; how they are actually doing. The first answer will almost never be truthful. Ask them how they Actually are and make them feel like no matter what your love is unconditional and that you really care about them being happy and that it is important to you that they get to be happy and that if they aren‚Äôt they should talk about it with you.

But yeah sorry if I got a bit off topic, just wanted to give a fuller scope of my struggles. Not that my struggles are the Worst struggles in the world comparatively but it‚Äôs been really hard for me and I just want people to know the people close to them sometimes don‚Äôt show their true selves and that just showing you care helps so much more than you could imagine."

"Being held financially liable is not the same as being forced to serve as an actual incubator. There is a limitation of their freedom by virtue of removing resources from them ,but there is no limitation of their bodily autonomy. The two are not comparable in that sense.

The only way it would be comparable is, again, forcing a man to serve as a dialysis machine for another human being. In such a case it wouldn't also just be the man's body at stake, there would also be another human life at stake, and one that could suffer and die if he was not strapped down and forced to let his kidneys clean someone else's blood. 
You have not answered this very simple comparison, and it is one that you *must* reckon with. If we can force women to be pregnant, we must also be able to force everyone, regardless of gender, to give up their bodily autonomy for others, and this can go beyond my one hypothetical example and be extended to mandatory blood donations, or even enforced organ donation. 
If you do not also believe such measures should be taken, but do believe that women should be forced to carry a pregnancy to term, then you are deciding that she has less rights on the basis of her sex, and that is misogyny."

"The system doesnt really matter, new systems are created for commoners to fight against the powerful, then eventually a new wave of powerful people control everything. The U.S. is no exception, in the beginning people moved here to escape religious persecution and then ofcourse the church gave commoners power by interwinding divine law into the government. Once the power changes hands it corrupts and keeps the cycle going.

Also to address losing faith in the government, I encourage you to get a government job and see how unorganized and dysfunctional it is. Most government jobs have high levels of job security that breeds an apathetic workforce. In an ideal world I'd like us to incorporate socialist ideals such as universal healthcare, fair wages and a UBI. I just think we are too far gone for any of that to work, big corporations have far too much power and our government isn't capable of bringing them down to a stable level.  "

"If you knew the future, you could easily make over 100% on even the most uneventful days, and big move days like today can be worth over 1000% without day trading; For example, some Nvidia puts are up 1200% today.

If you only started with $1000 you would be restricted in the number of day trades you could make (3 per 5 trading days) until you earned $25k, but you could easily get to that in a week, so it doesn't really matter.

If you were day trading, you could probably get closer to 1,000% every day, but you'd have to be trading from 9:30am to 4pm.

Eventually you would have so much money that you wouldn't be able to get filled on the trades that would get you 1,000% because these high risk trades don't have a lot of volume, but you could still be getting daily returns between 100% and 500% with higher volume trades until your account size was in the billions.

&amp;#x200B;

It is very easy to get approved to trade options these days, plenty of high schoolers with zero experience in the stock market are trading on phone apps. You can be up and running in however long it takes to transfer your money over (about 5 days). 

It doesn't matter if you don't get approved for trading more advanced strategies because long calls/puts are the first strategies you will be approved for and these have the potential for the biggest and fastest returns on a day to day basis anyway... if you knew the future you would only trade with long calls or puts.

&amp;#x200B;

Now if your character doesn't actually know the future and is just stupidly lucky,  I've seen plenty of people with 1000% in a day or week, but doing this more than two or three times in a row would read ridiculous to me, but getting 100% a month fairly consistently is stupidly lucky, but easily possible.

"I'm not sure how the ray tracing cores work or what calculations they specifically do. Nvidia hasn't released too much info on that (at least I haven't seen it). The tensor cores are very straightforward, they do very simple matrix math. You could use them for working with large matrices (exactly what Neural Networks aka AI does). I'm sure you could find some other applications for this type of core, but right now Neural networks are hot and being able to train them quickly is very valuable.

The ray tracing cores basically simulate light bouncing around on different objects and how it would be affected by that. I'm not sure what types of computations they do exactly or how else you could use them. Obviously they would be good for simulating light... which is what they were made for and what they will do in games.

CUDA cores are the main cores that Nvidia cards have come out with and a card will have thousands of them. They can do a lot of different computations and actions (much less than a normal intel processor). That's why they're used for crypto mining. A 2080 Ti will have like 4000 cores while a top of the line i9 has 8. Those CUDA cores are advanced enough to do hashes and crypto mining so there is a lot of value in using video cards right now for these cores. They are used for much more than crypto, and are used in many scientific applications where you prefer many parallel computations at once. These cores are simpler than intel CPU cores but they can do a lot."

I sometimes pray Matins from the 1962 version, but honestly it‚Äôs really lengthy considering my time of day.

Normally I pray laudes and prime but sometimes I don‚Äôt have time for laudes. At a minimum I pray prime and compline. Their perfect bookends IMO.

Also, the diviniumofficium site is generally reliable. I haven‚Äôt found any glaring issues yet, but some of their more exotic choices do have technical or textual problems problems. But for the most part their core versions (1570, 1910, 1960) are spot on.

"We were really wasted when we went to sleep and I assume that people do weird things during their sleep sometimes because i often do as do other people i have slept with. We'd been friends for several years including a brief time when i'd had a crush on him but he then went on to date my best friend, we slept in the same bed a few times and he never tried to make a move besides that one hand on my ass during sleep. I think that it's up to the two people in the situation to say whether the situation was sexual or not and i'm sure both of us would look back on it and say that it wasn't a sexual situation. This guy isn't socially awkward either, like if he had wanted to make a move, he would've genuinely made a move and so that's why it wasn't sexual assault or anything really sexually motivated to me.

I just looked it up and it's good there was a juggalette there at the right place and time to keep things calm.


https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/kz7w8x/what-the-fuck-happened-at-the-juggalo-march-on-washington


&gt;Roughly 20 ANTIFA members with their arms folded and bandanas covering their faces watched from the side of the stage. A Juggalo had approached ANTIFA earlier and asked them to leave, but they had come back. At one point, the feminist Juggalette Rachel Paul approached them. They offered her a group hug and according to Paul's account said, ""We are on guard to protect [Juggalos] from the police brutality through self-defense only should the need arise."" Paul assured them that the only issue with the DC police was that they had confiscated ICP's chicken feathers when they revealed they'd be throwing them across the Mall during their performance. ""Chicken feathers aside,"" Paul explained, ""we [are[ a nonviolent protest practicing passive resistance in the spirit of Dr. King and Ghandi."" 


-



&gt;ANTIFA members shook her hands and promised to respect their approach. ""I considered them allies,"" Paul told me in a text message. But C-list Pizzagate Truther Jack Posobiec had arrived in a blue suit to live stream the march. ANTIFA surrounded him. ""Nazis!"" they screamed. ""Nazis!"" Posobiec, who has denied relations to the alt-right, smiled. The Juggalo next to me rolled his eyes. ""He's alt light!"" he joked.

&gt;The Juggalos ignored the chaos and took off, leaving provocateurs behind them, and sped around the Washington Mall.  





I'm glad the Nazis didn't end up actually going there in force though. It probably would have gotten violent if they did.

"[Outer Space Treaty](http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/outerspacetreaty.html), Article VIII:

&gt; A State Party to the Treaty on whose registry an object launched into outer space is carried shall retain jurisdiction and control over such object, and over any personnel thereof, while in outer space or on a celestial body. Ownership of objects launched into outer space, including objects landed or constructed on a celestial body, and of their component parts, is not affected by their presence in outer space or on a celestial body or by their return to the Earth.

And your country (which is almost certainly a signatory) is obliged by Article VI to ensure you respect that:

&gt; States Parties to the Treaty shall bear international responsibility for national activities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, whether such activities are carried on by governmental agencies or by non-governmental entities, and for assuring that national activities are carried out in conformity with the provisions set forth in the present Treaty. The activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty.

Almost all countries are signatories to the Treaty and have [national laws to implement it](http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/nationalspacelaw/index.html).

For example, as a British citizen I'm subject to the [Outer Space Act of 1986](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/38/introduction):

&gt; Be it enacted by the Queen‚Äôs most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:‚Äî

---
&gt; A person to whom this Act applies shall not, subject to the following provisions, carry on an activity to which this Act applies except under the authority of a licence granted by the Secretary of State.

---
&gt; (a)  launching or procuring the launch of a space object  
&gt; (b) operating a space object  
&gt; (c) any activity in outer space

---
&gt; He shall not grant a licence unless he is satisfied that the activities authorised by the licence‚Äî  
&gt; (a) will not jeopardise public health or the safety of persons or property  
&gt; ...

so I wouldn't be granted one for space privateering.

And if I were then to just continue into outright piracy without a license:

&gt; If a justice of the peace is satisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for believing‚Äî  
  (a) that an activity is being carried on by a person to whom this Act applies in contravention of section 3 (licensing requirement) or in contravention of the conditions of a licence, and  
 (b) that a direction under section 8 has not been complied with, or a refusal to comply with such a direction is apprehended, or the case is one of urgency,he may issue a warrant authorising a named person acting on behalf of the Secretary of State to **do anything necessary to secure compliance** with the international obligations of the United Kingdom or with the conditions of the licence..."

"&gt;but the back one drags a lot and you can see how it feels uneven when you brake

That means either the brake isn't adjusted right or your rear wheel is out of true, nothing to do with not a suitable brake or not, or a cheaper brake - those aren't symptoms that would be caused by that. 

The wrong type of brake would just mean a different feel at the lever and less power (which shouldn't really matter on the rear wheel since it only needs to have a fraction of the power of the front brake)

&gt;though i prolly wont be able to sell it cos i don't feel good giving somebody a bike with uneven brakes like this.

I doubt most people would care much if it was set up right. How much are you using the rear brake anyway?

This is a ridiculously dramatic post for a minor issue most people wouldn't care that much about. It really sounds like you have some other issues going on that are nothing to do with this or the bike."

"&gt;The statement should be ""Even if you like STV better you have to agree that MMP would give a better outcome than FPTP."" As in.. Why the fuck didn't the Liberals implement MMP!?!?!

Completely irrelevant and a pointless change of subject. Why? Because that's over and fucking done with. Arguments about who was right and who was wrong in the past are pointless; we can't change it now. The ontario liberals are out of power and will not be even close to power for at least 4 years. Arguing about that now is just dumb internet drama.

But there is a chance for reform, because the Federal liberals are in power, they are very likely to hold on to power, and they are likely to still be willing to implement ranked voting.

All we need is to get the federal NDP on board which is what we have a much better chance of doing than inventing a time machine and convincing the OLP.

No one has put any pressure on the NDP for their decision. If we start doing that, who knows what might happen? If you care about electoral reform and have an ounce of pragmatism in your body you would be working to convince NDP voters and the NDP to change their selfish stance before Prime Minister Doug Ford happens with 37% of the vote."

OK ;-)
"All economic activity is beset by externalities, regardless of what system it takes place in. Principles of economics obviously don‚Äôt apply to just capitalism, they apply to everything, and it‚Äôs not like non-capitalist systems have proven to be any better at pricing externalities in. In fact if you‚Äôre well read on non-capitalist societies throughout history, you‚Äôre likely to agree that capitalism is massively better at accounting for obscure costs than anything else, and it‚Äôs not even close. Of course because it relies on the value judgments of millions of individuals rather than a handful of highly motivated and informed economists, there are blind spots, so that‚Äôs where government incentives are useful. But putting value judgments in the hands of a few experts has its own problems, similar to the problems of keeping a benevolent dictatorship benevolent.

&gt;	Im sure the white middle class of americans have had it easy for 150 years and have something to celebrate. But just like in my country, its all built upon centuries of the suffering of others. And for what? The symptoma of a sick, unequal society are clear to see.

See there you go again, saying it‚Äôs built on the suffering of others. It‚Äôs not, it was built through the compounded toiling of the people who built it. It‚Äôs not like the Natives here were all getting along with each other singing kumbaya ‚Äì they were fighting one another for territory too, and even more fiercely than we would later be fighting them. This self-hatred for past actions that our societies have ostensibly grown to know better than to do is no different than a kid growing up and becoming embarrassed when they occasionally remember past mistakes, now that he/she is more mature. It‚Äôs like dude... once you know not to do it again, you don‚Äôt need to keep beating yourself up about it, that‚Äôs just hurting you in the present and future.

Also inequality in society is not a problem unless your society has a jealousy problem. Theres always going to be inequality, because peoples‚Äô ability to create value for others in society is vastly unequal. Regardless, this isn‚Äôt a zero sum game, another man being more successful doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre a failure. And it doesn‚Äôt mean he got his material wealth by taking it from others, either. When I create or improve something and sell it to someone, I‚Äôm literally creating value for the society in exchange for ‚Äúvalue tokens‚Äù that the buyer was given in exchange for creating value for someone else. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a fixed pool of money and you can only get more by taking from someone else.

&gt;	Trump and us/uk politics are ensuring that the wealth is continually syphoned off to the capitalist classes.

Look man, these days the capitalist class is everyone with citizenship and future job prospects. If you‚Äôre investing in your future through education, buying a car or computer to commute to work, buying ETFs for retirement, etc. you‚Äôre engaging in the exact same kind of capital investment that people buying companies are. You‚Äôre taking a financial risk that may or may not pay you back in the future. And you know, pretty much anyone who‚Äôs smart and plays their cards right can find themselves buying a company or what have you when they reach maturity.

Frankly, it looks like parts of Europe are running into the same problems that the US is right now. Brexit was pretty extreme, and in radicalism terms, Theresa May looks to be for Jeremy Corbyn what Hillary Clinton is for Donald Trump. I  still wouldn‚Äôt call it a sinking ship through."
So your saying that the president of the United States is aware of a fabricated act of domestic terrorism? Surely he will address this right?
"You can message them on their [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/LittleHandWoodcrafts/) to get something started, I basically just described the general shape &amp; colors I wanted  but I'm sure if you wanted something specific they could work it out."
"Yeah sorry, I hadn't read it properly. 

To get ah from the reserve capacity you can divide by 2.4, or multiply by 0.417 (both come to the same number in your situation of 58). So you have 116ah total from 2 batteries with 58 useable at 50% discharge.

Now what can you do? You can get higher rated batteries (agm is recommended since you shouldn't need to add water to it, and the price is quite good). Lithium in all ways (except cost) are better these days as they're lighter/can be discharged further and typically hold more power within the same size as an AGM/lead acid. The newer lithium batteries hitting the market now don't need special charging equipment as they come with the BMS/Charging built in."

"There is no privacy law in regards to this in any state I'm aware of.  You can most certainly tell a customer (or anyone else for that matter) that an employee was fired.  It happens all the time, mostly by less than legal savvy managers or employees.  

Most companies choose not to out of fear of litigation, and HR will inform all management.  Lets say disgruntled employee or his lawyer call up their former employer and ask why they were fired.  Former employer starts dishing shit.  One of the many things they say can not be proven or is not-factually based.  Then they just exposed themselves in a lawsuit.  

This is one of the many reasons employers refuse to verify anything for a former employee except dates of employment and position held.  They normally won't even tell you why they left or were fired.  

It's protection from litigation if something inappropriate is inadvertently said.  Not an actual law preventing them from telling you.  

tl;dr:  As a manager, I can say whatever the fuck it is I want about a former employee so long as it is factual.  No law prevents that.  I can be sued for slander if it's not factual.  My company policy dictates I say nothing except employment dates and position held, for this reason.  "

"It took me a while to remember this comment, but I just have to say:  it's pretty disingenuous to quote perhaps the smallest and least relevant point in my comment to try and bounce your nonsense off of it.

Vegans aren't trying to fix a problem to the best of their ability, they're choosing to eat soy over hamburger and claiming that because of it their shit don't stink.  They obviously don't say that, but that's the undercurrent of most of what they say; far too much of it is just smug virtue signaling that's meant to give them an unearned and undeserved sense of moral superiority; they think that because they don't eat meat they can then look down their noses as those that do.  I'd actually feel something other than contempt for them if they just admitted a fraction of that, but they're off hugging trees thinking they're doing the world a favor by taking up space.

Meanwhile, they're busy writing their blogs and talking to their equally vapid friends on technology manufactured in sweatshops by Chinese workers who live in abysmal conditions in factories that have to install anti-suicide equipment so that they don't lose workers too fast to replace in a country that has a billion people in it.

I've said it on r/vegan more than once, but I have no problem with the IDEA of veganism (I had an entirely meat-free lunch yesterday, for example), it's the VEGANS that annoy me because mostly what you see of them, the public face as it were, is jerkoffs who think looking 90 pounds soaking wet and pallid is the place to be.

I'm not smug about what I am and what I do, I'm just realistic about what's possible.  Being a scientist I'm already aware of efforts to clone meat in vats, and know that virtually everything we eat, be in animal or vegetable, is the result of thousands of years of selective breeding for a specific purpose.  It's not done out of cruelty, it's done out of necessity; you could argue it's acting indifferently, but we act indifferently about the suffering of our fellow man all the time, and nobody forms smug little clubs about that."

Yeah, it wasn't very concise. Ended up way too fucking long, and then I found like 8 other people throwing out the phrase ""burden of proof"" in exactly the same (wrong and disingenuous) way and took some time to stop being a moron and figure out a short version. Sorry you got the shitty, long rambling one.

&gt;PhD Linguist who studies the Latin origins of western phrases. 

No, just someone who knows what a burden of proof is and doesn't try and throw it around to falsely accuse people of not giving a good enough justification for whatever they believe.

&gt;Okay ‚ÄúChomsky‚Äù, you‚Äôre a pompous dick bag and your response is based on the presumption that I am an atheist when you have no idea what my positions are

What part of my response was based on that presumption? I haven't contested your beliefs at all. I contested your use of ""burden of proof"" in the context you used it, saying that he had it because he made a claim. What I said applies exactly the same whether you are a theist or an atheist. I did assume you were an atheist, because honestly, you're a redditor falsely accusing a theist of having burden of proof, I'd be lying if I said otherwise. But nothing I said had any basis in that assumption.   
I pointed out my position because typically, someone on reddit would make exactly that same assumption about me, and assume I was a christian or something. And most redditors making assumptions *will* form their arguments based on what they think I believe, rather than what I'm saying. Which I tried not to do with you.

&gt;. You are the Deepak Chopra of Reddit, a bullshit artist that exaggerates and talks out of his ass, 

I wasn't very concise. Sounds more like you're exaggerating here though.

&gt;resumably because of underlying insecurities.

Armchair psychologist.

&gt; You stated nothing of substance and wasted everyone‚Äôs time. 

I stated plenty of substance. Mostly wasted my own time I think, though. Doesn't really look like you read or understood anything.

&gt;Are you joking... you can literally say the same thing about the existence of a god. There is no evidence you can present that I can‚Äôt present as equally credible for unicorns. Go ahead and try..

This makes me think you really didn't read what I wrote at all. But I'll go ahead and try:

There are no environments god is claimed to exist in that mankind have visited and talked about.  
Contrary to this, mankind has explored everywhere one would expect to find a unicorn, if they existed, and found none.  
I already presented this, and you didn't present them as equally credible the first time. I'm not sure how repeating it a second time will matter.

&gt;Your Coelacanth analogy was a ridiculous and obvious attempt for attention. Most theists will cling to the analogies of Socrates, but not you you intellectual savant lmao 

Coelacanth analogy is similar to the god one, because the deep ocean floor is mostly unexplored. I'm not sure how that would be an attempt for attention. I don't know why that would get attention, or why you think I would think it would get attention. You have me puzzled there. Are coelacanths popular now?

"The three biggest things that still keep me from even considering iOS: notifications (Android's still *far* ahead, as it's always been), data sharing between apps is still a crapshoot (and no filesystem so you can't workaround it), and default apps / proper app link handling. There's a huge list of other things that annoy me with iOS, but most of them are relatively minor or things I could live with.

I was really hoping they'd have replaced the SE with something a bit more in-between. The Pixel 3 has thoroughly pissed me off by ruining one-handed use, and if Apple had made a one-hand friendly model it would've given me a pretty strong incentive to put up with iOS's awkward interface."

"The *real* risk for the lower lying regions in the Bay Area (such as Foster City, etc) is that they're largely built on *landfill* rather than actual bedrock.

The same issue that caused a large portion of the Marina District in San Francisco to collapse in the '89 Loma Prieta quake.

As a general rule, much of the property **east** of the railroad tracks that travel up El Camino on the peninsula may be on landfill, and the property **west** of the tracks (ie. Towards the Santa Cruz Foothills / ocean) is largely anchored in bedrock - making it more stable in a large quake."

"Nationalism, with a capital N, as practised by Nationalists, as Trump now claims to be, is not the same as patriotism... a mistake you just made repeatedly.

This is why you're getting confused and unable to understand the connections I'm making.

Here, I'll even look up the definitions for you as part of the service, **because it's very silly to be getting super passionate about a word while using the wrong definition for it.**

&gt;patriotism (pƒÅÀàtrƒì-…ô-tƒ≠zÀå…ôm)  
&gt;  
&gt;n. Love of and devotion to one's country.  
&gt;  
&gt;nationalism (na¬∑tion¬∑al¬∑ism  | \\Àànash-n…ô-Àåli-z…ôm,[ ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nationalism?pronunciation&amp;lang=en_us&amp;dir=n&amp;file=nation03) Ààna-sh…ô-n…ô-Àåli-z…ôm\\   )  
&gt;  
&gt;1  **:** loyalty and devotion to a nation   especially **:** a sense of national consciousness (see [consciousness sense 1c](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consciousness))  exalting one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on  promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other  nations or [supranational](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supranational) groups

Here's the difference... **write this down if you need to.**

Patriotism is loving your country, which is totally fine, but you'll notice absolutely no one is using that word in the current context... nationalism is saying your country is uniquely the best country, often doesn't need other countries at all, and, unlike patriotism, clearly implies accepting that other countries/people are inferior.

I'll leave it as an exercise for you to think why the difference is very, very important.

Then you can revisit your comment above."

"So, I understand what you're trying to get at here, and I know you're probably just fucking around, but let me explain why ""scaling damage for more damage"" and ""scaling projectiles for more damage"" isn't necessarily the best comparison.

You see, scaling damage for more damage has been around forever, and it's pretty much the basis of the game at this point. It just gives you what you expect - you take a 30% more damage gem, that's gonna give you 30% more damage. It's not very interesting, but it's not supposed to be - it is, has only ever been, and likely will only ever be, something that gives you damage. Not utility, not defenses, just damage.

Scaling damage with projectiles, on the other hand, is a mechanic and something that makes a skill more special. It allows you to take something that otherwise would give you utility with clearing, and translate it to straight damage instead. It makes finding those sources of extra projectiles valuable, and it makes the skill itself more interesting as a result.

*Except*, it doesn't make the skill more interesting when there are too many skills that do it, and that's what I'm concerned about. At this point, ""extra projectiles"" has been used with so many skills as ""hey these mean extra damage now"" that the two are becoming inseparable and the novelty of trying to build around this concept is fading, making it seem like a tired design in my eyes.

This is the difference between scaling damage for damage and scaling projectiles for damage - one is just the expected bread-and-butter interactions within the game, the other is something that is supposed to set a skill apart from the rest in playstyle and mechanics except when it doesn't because it's an overused concept."
"Alright, listen here nutcase #2. The FBI investigation on Kavanaugh was one of the most sorry excuses for an investigation I've ever seen. They were given only one week and were initially only allowed to interview 4 witnesses. 4 witnesses is rarely even enough for a lawsuit between two fucking elementary school kids.

""Timothy stole my lunch!""

""Oh yeah! Prove it Johnny! No one else says they saw it!""

Even after the white house loosened up, which by the way, why is the nominnator of the nominee running an investigation that might find his nomination guilty?, they were still restricted by an incredible time constraint and were still not allowed to investigate Kavanaugh himself or his one cited witness who supposedly can't even remember huge chunks of his life despite being Kavanaugh's key witness.


Meanwhile, Clinton allowed for several thorough investigations. Not just one. And even went through a 9 (11? I forgot. Heh. 9/11) hour hearing as cool as can be, probably even looking a bit bored, all to get over this email bullshit.

I don't fancy being the human equivalent of a tapeworm but that doesn't mean I don't think that people who enjoy it shouldn't at least work a little for the free lunch we give them. You say that's a ""fantasy"" but whereas I explained why I think the way I do and have you a nice logic train explaining my thought process, all you've done is assert it's wrong based on nothing. Exactly as I predicted you would. You could at least point out where I'm wrong and why but you haven't even done that.

On the subject of ease of subject matter: all of the above. Especially since they don't actually have to do their own research and have experts every step of the way telling them what best practice is. If they didn't have staff the I could see it being semi-challenging just because of the variety of topics you'd have to have a passing understanding of. A passing understanding though is all that's required in the end though. They don't actually have to do much at the end of the day after all. They're not actually building or designing the railroad they just have to do some paperwork and know what they're signing off on, for example.

Again though, this isn't really relevant to my original point. The ease of a job doesn't excuse someone from not working hard at it. Especially considering how much we pay them for such a light workload (again, as evidence I cite how little time they spend working and how little that seems to effect productivity)."

"Airline weight limit checks is a tricky one in SEA (I will include Australia and New Zealand in case you drop down that way) as they do tend to enforce the weight limit if they catch you.From personal experience if the bag looks oversized and or heavy (I.E. you look like you are having a hard time with it) then you may get singled out.There is also a possibility the airline is doing a crackdown and staff are required to check.

As for the drugs it looks like you put the labels in the bags so you should be fine, after saying that do make sure nothing there is prohibited in the countries you are traveling too as each country if different.

Gear wise you probably could drop some of the clothes for a higher wash cycle such as socks, boxers  the extra shorts and perhaps the R1 unless you are planning on colder regions or hiking some of the taller mountains in Indonesia or well get cold easily.

There are lighter options to the REI Flash 22L such as the Sea to Summit packable daypack which you could consider.

"If you ever watched Avatar: the Last Airbender, I would literally compare it to if the creators knew what they were doing with Korra from the get-go.

The technology has advanced from Medieval technology to \~mid-late 1800s (horseless carriages are new, but I don't know if they've figured out gun magazines yet). The scale is similar--starts off as a small group doing a one-off adventure and works towards them meddling in the works of deities--but the style is very different. It goes from a thieving crew in a grimdark world originally just trying to make things better in Era 1, to a much more magic-cowboy feel as technology has progressed and the world changed; Sanderson's writing prose has only gotten better as time has gone on, however.

Alloy of Law is my least favorite book of Era 2 simply because it was originally supposed to be a one-off book and you can sort of tell, and because the new everything was just such a shock to the system. By Shadows of Self I had warmed up to the new cast and style and was really enjoying them--it also contains one of my favorite emotional *thud*s in anything I've ever read. Bands of Mourning was the one that caused me to love Era 2 exponentially more than Era 1 because of some things he does with the characters, some things that happen that have massive Cosmere implications, and some things that happen that have massive Scadriel and worldbuilding implications (the planet they're on).

Read them. Maybe you don't have to read them now, but make sure you read them.

Oh, and Mistborn: Secret Histories has things that involve the Spiritual Realm and what happened to Kelsier and the Lord Ruler that takes place between the Eras. Many people say to read it after Era 2 so you know what the heck happened, I personally liked it more reading it immediately after an Era 1 reread because everything was fresh on my mind, but it's definitely something you should consider getting around to reading at some point or another if you like stuff that builds on his magic systems and the Cosmere as a whole."
I mean if anything the game'll pause and tell you to reconnect it.

"If you were one of the people who could gather lots of points, leaderboards were great. Although I remember the event with Scarlet Witch needing an absurd amount of points just to get all of the milestone rewards. I never quite got enough points during leaderboards to make an impact on the milestones. I was always in the low point percentile at the end of a leaderboard so I didn't really get the most rewards. One thing I really did dislike about them though is when you were a couple points off of a milestone TinyCo wouldn't always bump you up to where you could get them. Sometimes they would bump you up if there was an issue though. I view leaderboards as just another system where TinyCo had no idea how to use them effectively. Or perhaps they did know how to use them effectively when it came to making money off of them. Milestones were great though if you could take advantage of them for sure. :)"

"So, there are 2 answers to this:

1. The more commonly known space that is ""beyond"" reality is a transitory plane, weaved into the fabric of reality. just under the surface, this was used by the Earth Empire to transport untold billions of tons of supplies, soldiers and travelers throughout their domain. This system allowed virtually any citizen (a small and privileged group, but still numbering in the hundreds of millions) to travel anywhere within Empire territory, which ultimately lead to their downfall to the Hellfire Plague. Today, this system has been stumbled upon by very few survivors of the Empire's collapse, some of whom have formed a cult worshiping the powers that have brought them to this impossible place.

2. Reality is governed by a series of mathematical equations, and conforms to these equations' limits. However, there is a ""place"" where these equations are flaunted, Commonly known as the Far Realm. Locating it is impossible, as for it to have a location, it would need to make sense in the scope of sentient conception. Travel there is not possible, but it can be breached, leaking impossibilities into our orderly reality, with damage that is irreconcilable with our understanding of death, life, destruction, creation, chaos or order."

"I don't really see the irony there? Any company is free to buy a British business if an agreement can be made and it meets the regulatory standards. The UK has one of the most open economies on Earth. Just because it's Indian (which for the record operates an annual revenue of over $100bn, so let's not pretend they're not a force in their own right) means nothing.

Over the last 10 or so years, I believe India is in the top five investors in the UK year after year (3rd, just behind France was when I last checked), and the UK has been the top investor in India since 2000, creating an estimated ~370,000 jobs. Something like 1 in 20 organised private sector jobs in India are now at a British-owned company, with over 100,000 British private sector jobs are at Indian companies (Tata owned businesses of course being the main ones).

Considering India is growing at around 7% annually, and it just on the curve at which is will soon start to grow at absolute rates totally outstripping those of more Western economies, there's not really a better time to invest in the country and further trading links. I have absolutely no issue whatsoever in the UK (or EU for that matter) looking to further these links.

Further, Jaguar Land Rover is a single entity. Tata only had to buy that single company to own both brands Jaguar and Land Rover."

"There is full hydro, hydro assist, and hybrid-assist.

Full hydro totally replaces all your steering and you have no direct connection. Pros: very powerful, no bump steer, equal turning speed, can easily extend wheelbase Cons: if a line blows you will lose steering. Great for a trail only rig.

Hydro assist retains your current steering system but replaces your shock absorber with a hydrolic ram. Pros: affordable, powerful, still have steering if a line blows Cons: one direction turns quicker due to the piston surface area being smaller on the side with the rod coming out.

Hybrid-assist/full hydro assist (I'm making this name up, call it what you want). This setup uses a double ended full hydro ram to replace your tierod, a manual steering box, and a hydroservo. Pros: equal turning speed, retains mechanical steering linkage if you loose hydrolics, fast and powerful cons: the most costly, must match hydrolic flow/pressure between components for optimal performance.

This is a very anemic intro to hydrolic steering so here are more links if you want to keep learning.

"Pantheon was my first real champion too, while his combos are simple, there are some things that even experienced players overlook and forget. I'm not sure exactly what kind of advice you need but to disambiguate here are some common mistakes pantheon players forget to do. (I'm still really good with him)   
1. **Your E does damage if you cast it for its full duration.** Heartseeker strike hits 3 times, if you use E then cancel it, you're not playing to pantheon's full potential.   
2. Other players: Q is poke.   
Me: **Q is also an autoattack animation cancel.** When you're trading and you want to use Q, remember that it is a cast spell. That means you can Auto Q Auto and your Q will NOT slow down your ability to squeeze autos in. In addition, by doing so you are stacking your aegis much faster.   
3. **Do not lead off with your stun when you already have aegis up.** Your stun gives you a passive. Don't be inefficient and lead with it when you already have your passive up. Walk up to someone, throw a Q or E in front of them then commit with W. You block 2 autos and if you combo right, you stack up a 3rd passive instantly. 

4. **Your ult is essentially a teleport/Gank tool**. Use it to group rather than to duel. If your team is doing drag, use ult to group. If your team wants to attack a sidelane, use it to group. If your team wants you to gank, use it to group. GROUP GROUP GROUP. This is what your ult is for. It takes a long time to channel so don't even think about using it in the middle of a 1v1.   
5. **Build CDR:** You have so many viable items that include cdr in their kit. Duskblade, Youmuus, Cleaver, Death's Dance, Maw. With 40% cdr you should be 24/7 threatening sidelanes with your ultimate. You essentially become a nocturne except you're a part time baker on the side.   
6. **Your all in potential is a carry's deterrent so be PATIENT:** ADC's aren't going to walk up and hit people when they see a full AD Pantheon nearby. They'll hesitate and that's the key. An ADC that is hesitating is an ADC that is not auto attacking. Your mere presence is enough for adc's to say ""Fuck it, I'm not putting my neck in there when Baker can 1 shot me"". The point is to play teamfights flexibly. Throw in some Q's, hit people with E or auto attacks but always be ready to kill the carry when needed. But the second you use your combo inefficiently, you're exposed and then carries can safely rain hell.

"A very large portion of today's Republican Party wants to return the US to the 1950s if not the 1920s or 1890s. Redefining *sex* in terms of the law is an obvious part of that agenda.

IMO, Congress has been too lazy about this. Time to amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make Congress's intentions explicit with respect to the definition of *sex*. Leave this up to the executive branch, and the definition can change whenever the presidency changes hands.

Whether Trump is aware of this may be irrelevant. He could be aware and not care about it. This is now public, and the President has been deafening in his silence on the issue."

"so, related rates

The basic idea behind related rates is this:

we have an equation which describes a scenario. For example, we have that the total amount of snow in a snowball with radius r is equal to V=4œÄr^(3)/3. Now, we make the assumption that every variable in this equation is actually a function of another variable, time for example. So r is a function r=r(t), and V is a function V=V(t)

Now, the problem is that we don't know the explicit formulas of V(t) and r(t). What we do know is that at some time t, the radius of the snowball is 20cm, and that it is decreasing at 2 cm/min. 

So, at that point, t0, r(t0)=20, r'(t0)=-2

And we can use that information to figure out how quickly V(t) is changing at t0, or in other words, we can calculate V'(t0), without knowing what the function V(t) actually looks like.

How do we do this?

We differentiate the entire equation with respect to t

So V'(t)=4œÄr^(2)r'(t) by the chain rule

So now, we know that at this point t0, r=20, and r'(t0)=-2, so 4œÄ(20)^(2)(-2)=-3200œÄ

So we know that V'(t0)=-3200œÄ, or the volume is decreasing at a rate of -3200œÄ cm^(3)/min when r=20 cm, r'(t0)=-2 cm/min

-----

To summarize, related rates follow a pretty standard procedure

1) Set up an equation that describes the scenario (V=4œÄr^(3)/3)

2) Write the equation again in terms of the dummy variable (V(t)=4œÄ(r(t))^(3)/3)

3) Write down all the information you know about the scenario (r(t0)=20, r'(t0)=-2)

4) Use the information gathered in 2 to get more information (since r(t0)=20, V(t0)=4œÄ(8000)/3=16000œÄ/3)

5) differentiate with respect to the dummy variable (V'(t)=4œÄ(r(t))^(2)r'(t))

6) Substitute in the information that you know from part 2 and part 3 (V'(t0)=4œÄ(20)^(2)(-2))

7) Solve (4œÄ(20)^(2)(-2)=-3200œÄ, so V'(t0)=-3200œÄ cm^(3)/min)"

"&gt;How does this work with outsider creatures (assuming divine to refer to any alignment for gods not just LG/NG/CG gods) as depending on the CR some or all of their abilities would be 'divine'

That is how I intend it to work. My thought is that a Null may even be *greater invisible* to outsiders that rely on supernatural perception. If Zeus wanted to kill a Null, he couldn't use a lightning bolt - he'd have to punch him to death... and he would be fighting blind. I wanted deities to hate and fear the God of the Gaps and his worshipers.

&gt;Can demons and angels be made into Nulls or would it wipe them out instantly if they heard the answer as they would lose all divine abilities

If I was DMing this I'd say that demons and angels can't hear ma's answer, in a sort of ""It¬†is difficult to get a man to¬†understand¬†something, when¬†his salary depends¬†upon¬†his not understanding it!"" sense."

It's one of the strongest versions of screw threadlocker you can buy and is mostly permanent if you use enough of it. Blue loctite is normally used for things such as electronics because it keeps things secured enough to where they don't vibrate loose but it's also easier to undo.

"I agree entirely.

&gt;For many, you might think ""Never give up on them."" and I disagree. 

Honestly, this attitude of 'Never give up on someone!' is so unbiblical it's amazing.

There's a minority - a minority within a minority, really - of people in this subculture you can talk with, forge some kind of communication and common understanding with. But the fact is, a good number are hostile, and their interaction with others presupposes cultural/social dominance. We have to keep that in mind.

"It definitely is possible to get high from cbd, but thats from the thc/terpenes. The first hemp flower I tried had a 33:1 cbd-thc ratio and I felt a body stone deeply and a head high (not nearly as potent as that from regular weed) and it had been 3 years since I had any weed. From experimentation I learned I'm very sensitive to thc. I got a tolerance to the head high from smoking hemp flower often, so the high is very short now (10-15 minutes) and isnt as strong as when I first started. These strains being sold over the internet can have total thc percentages up to 0.6%, which is not miniscule at all if you are sensitive to thc or have no tolerance."

"this dude is a douche but inevitably the comments will turn to lane splitting so
Lane splitting is legal where I live. So a couple of things as a motorcyclist:

1) yes, lane splitting is dangerous no matter what. Even if you‚Äôre going 15 or 20 and it‚Äôs at a red light just to cut in front, there‚Äôs still the danger of people being stupid. Going really fast is extremely dangerous. You know who does that? Stupid people. 
2) you don‚Äôt split lanes when there‚Äôs not enough space. You just don‚Äôt.  You end your lane splitting there, actually.
3) lane splitting is also dangerous because people will get angry at you, either because you‚Äôre lane splitting or just because you‚Äôre a motorcycle. I‚Äôve had people purposely bump me into other cars while looking me in the eye because they didn‚Äôt like where I was.
4) lane splitting is almost always a big risk for a little reward. 

If you have questions on lane splitting or motorcycles, I‚Äôll answer so you don‚Äôt have to assume things about them.

"Not sure if she‚Äôd down for this idea, but would she be ok with getting that fast food to go? You could go with her to get it and then eat at home together‚Äîyou‚Äôre still having that quality meal time together that way, so it shouldn‚Äôt matter that you‚Äôre not eating the same things. Might not be able to cook a full meal for yourself on those days, but maybe you could keep ingredients for some healthy but quick and easy meals stocked, and whip one of those up real fast on her fast food days. (My go-to is salads‚ÄîI keep lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, canned tuna, and dressing around always, and some weeks I‚Äôll get cucumbers or lunch meats or cheeses or hard boil some eggs or whatnot to add some variety. I don‚Äôt like nuts in salads myself, but that‚Äôs another good option that will keep in the pantry.)

If she‚Äôs totally opposed and insists she wants to eat there, well... it would be probably kind of weird, but maybe you could bring your dinner with you?

If that‚Äôs a no-go with her too, you might need to sit her down and have a more in-depth talk about your relationship with food right now and what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish, and what you feel would be helpful support from her on it (like compromising with you so you can both eat what you want to but still spend that time together)."

"Just about any USB 3.0 dock will work as a dock.

However, be aware, you'll be in for an uphill battle getting anything off of it. Mac drives typically are using a format that windows computer's can't read, so they typically need formatted before using them on a windows machine. There are programs out there than can enable you to read from them, but in my personal experience, I've seen those to work intermittently at best. And even if they were able to read it, the Mac versions of games, are typically wildly different from the PC versions and not compatible to just pull across like that.

You may be able to pull your itunes library across, but even that I'd be suspect of because of how crazily locked down Apple likes to keep it.

Your best bet would like be to get an external drive, format it as ExFAT (which both windows and OSX can use), and backup anything you want there, or, if you don't have a ton of stuff, use cloud backup like dropbox or google drive.

If you'd like a cheaper repair option, you may want to reach out to an independent repair shop that actually has skill in individual PCB component replacement, they may be able to do it significantly cheaper. The Popular guy that does this is Rossman Group, you've probably seen some of his rant videos online, he's based out of NYC, and there are other repairshops around the nation like him, they're fairly rare these days, but they do still exist."

"No, thank you, this is actually extremely helpful! I always feel really doubtful about being trans because I don't necessarily experience the same dysphoria as most trans people do, I think, because my coping mechanism is more just to dissociate and ignore my emotions/thoughts/feelings and just... go through the motions, but without actually living in the moment. And I'm really worried that because there's not some specific point in time where I remember hating one specific part of my body because of a specific reason, it's always just been... like a bad feeling I have towards my body lol. And I think it's extra confusing for me because I'm not sure where this feeling of unease and general uncomfortable-ness is coming from, whether it's my mental illness or real, actual body dysphoria. 

But I do agree with you, I think I also spent most of my adolescence either in denial or just disconnected. I mean, it does make sense now why I was so uncomfortable going into puberty and having my mom wanting me to buy bras and girly shit. It was never me, I don't think. But yeah, once I moved out and felt in a comfortable environment, I think these feelings and emotions just became to surface again, because now I can be more of myself without worrying so much about what the people I care about think. 

A part of me really wants to start T (begone baby/girlish face and feminine voice), but I'm just scared to. It feels like such a big step, and I've only just came out too. I want to ask, though, can you take T for awhile but then stop taking it and be okay? Like, it won't kill you right? lol  "

"Faith is not inherently a bad thing.

When people hear about ‚Äúblind faith‚Äù, they immediately jump to scientific or logical examples, such as ‚Äú2+2=5?‚Äù.

Where does that logic play in to a child with cancer?

Faith that there is something beyond us making sense of the chaotic world is what keeps many people going. Sure, you can say that it‚Äôs just to make us feel better then. So what! Are you really going to take that away from a child with cancer?

Additionally, people say faith has the potential to do harm. I agree; there are plenty of examples throughout history of religious ideologies being taken to violent means. There are also plenty of examples of political ideologies being taken to the same result. Should we do away with democracy because the Athenians waged war with the Persians? No. 

Any ideal, be it religious, political, racial, socio-economic, etc. can be used for violence. Faith is no more inherently dangerous on its own than any of those. Faith is okay (as is the lack thereof, if one so chooses).

"With the draft the way it is now there is still a wide spectrum between the top teams and the worst teams, idk what you mean by all teams are equally bad. A good team like the Pats succeeds every year with low picks and even losing picks. Besides the college model isn't fun. Unless your'e a fan of Bama or Clemson or Ohio State college football is super boring. The best teams get all the top recruits and stay good every year. Bad teams get bad recruits and are bad every year. At least the draft gives bad teams hope for the future."

"""keep shilling"" implying I'm being paid to talk about my guns lmao. I'd love to get paid to talk about guns. I actually read through my warranty, and watched a number of torture tests and reviews from people who shit on the PT111 and Taurus in general and the vast majority of them said it was a fantastic deal for $200 factory new, and it is. I've drop tested it, I've fired it with no gun oil while it's dirty as shit, and it's fallen out of my first cheap holster in parking lots and hasn't had an issue. Keep talking shit about it all you want, doesn't change the fact that it's an awesome little gun and has held up for me for 2 years now."
"Holy shit! This hits me in so many sorts of ways:
I was a 13B / Gun Bunny
I went to Ft. Sill Ok for Basic and AIT (oosha!)
I was attached to the 10th Mountain Division out of Ft. Drum, NY

I know these places!! These things!! And I def know how we 'haze' a dude! But since we were in the National Guard this would only take place when we went out for our two week 'vacation' in the field to train and it went thusly:

Any and every new guy to our company, and I mean any and every new guy, would have to go and get 'grid-squares' or a 'sky hook'. Those didn't exist. At all. No where. It was code for let's introduce the new guy to the company and all of its people and parts. And, stem off some of the daily hurry-up and wait / boredom. (Just for clarification this happened in the 90s so maybe it's changed and you guys actually use grid-squares and sky hooks these days with all your fancy tech. But they didn't exist in this time.)

Now, these new guys were all hepped-up to get things gig-line straight so they usually didn't question once it started. Now, I just want to say that this was done without malice and all in good fun. Every one in our company went through it and it was done during down-times (natch.)

It would start with one of us getting the bright idea to send the newb to the next gun to get some grid-squares. The next gun would know what was happening and say that it was over in maintenance. maintenance wold say that it they were over in the mess tent (if we had one) and then over to supply. You get the point. Eventually it would bring them all over our placement which could be 500 yards to 1/4 mile away. At some point someone at one placement would ask where'd they've been and depending on how bored one was, continue the ruse and send them farther down the line, or just fell down laughing because they have been run ragged for our amusement for quite some time. At which point, everyone, newb included, would have a good laugh and then crack open some MREs or a can of Chef Boyardee, whatever. It was fun. It was a way to show that we liked you because we were breaking your balls. Good manly bonding shit!

That is until Pvt. Self-Righteous Buzzkill came to our gun. There's always one that just takes shit too seriously. Pvt. SRBK was older than your usual Pvt at 38yrs old or something. I was in my early 20s. My section chief was in his 30s-late-30s. Pvt. SRBK had as the name implies some self-righteousness about him because he was already a CPA, had a nice life and for the life of me I have no idea what he was doing there. BUT ANYWAYs, we sent Pvt. SRBK on the 'mission.' I feel it is my duty at this time to say that pvt. SRBK was already not having a good time of it; He was pretty much allergic to everything and if anyone knows Ft. Drum, they know that the mosquitoes and black-flies are fucking ruthless. Pvt. SRBK was covered in calamine lotion from head to toe. He was all different shades of pink to black, this added to the hilarity at the beginning. 

So, Pvt. SRBK is gone for a long time. Like way longer than it should or could. Eventually he comes back and he is fucking pissed and starts throwing shit all over the place. He apparently thought that all the other positions were fucking with him and he was determined as fuck to find these goddamn grid-squares. It wan't until he got to Top that he finally realized what was going on. We're laughing our asses off because of the due-diligence he put in which only made him exacerbated the whole situation which just made it funnier. 

He was stolid for the rest of the trip. We just kind of let him be. No more shenanigans. Whatever, it was fun.  Done and over.

So remember that I said that everyone went through this lovely little process?... Well Pvt. SRBK thought it was personal. He went to... I forget how high up but high enough that Top and our Commander got a dressing down. 

Pvt. SRBK went on to become Soldier of the Year after that. And is like a Major something.

Until we had to pair off and do a role play.  The instructor gave us an affliction and we had to act it out while the other person had to diagnose and give the correct first aid.

I pretended to have a stroke, she didn't get it or help. I left the room and came back in to her with a pillow stuffed under her shirt.

She was moaning.  Breathing hard.  

""Oh daddy help me.""

She walked up to me.

""Mmmm daddy"" she said with a raspy voice.

""Daddy I need you. Please daddy""

She bit her lip and moaned.

""Oh daddy please, please help me daddy""

She looked so fuckable and the moans were so sexy, but having someone actually say daddy to me with the tone and inflection.

Oh dear Christ it awoke something in me.

"They matter but not as much as you think - as evident by the recent Xbox numbers.

Yes, consoles need their hero exclusives, but AAA cross platform games sell WAY more and that‚Äôs what the target market gamer is much more interested in.

PlayStation selling more is a function of multiple factors - a terrible Xbox launch, better AAA marketing deals, exclusives, and the zeitgeist of being ‚ÄúFor the gamers‚Äù. 

Sony and Microsoft at the moment have fundamentally different business strategies. Sony wants to sell as many consoles as possible, Microsoft wants as many people as possible to get into the Microsoft cloud, selling consoles is secondary. Naturally Sony will pour more resources into exclusives in order to lock people into buying more consoles, whereas Microsoft has been addressing a few different fundamentals that help drive more Microsoft cloud revenue, from driving more traffic to the store using UI enhancements to building up their cross platform social network. There needs to be an avenue back into the bigger Microsoft machine for Xbox to make sense, and pumping out exclusives in lock step with Sony without those mechanisms in place first makes very little sense to Microsoft. 

Now that they have those systems and platforms in place you‚Äôre seeing them invest more in first party to drive up the user base, because there‚Äôs a clearer ROI on those investments. Xbox can now drive Windows 10 revenue and vice versa, for example.

They‚Äôre not looking at this as Xbox vs PlayStation. They‚Äôre looking at this as Microsoft vs Google. Or Microsoft vs Amazon. The battle of tomorrow. It‚Äôs much broader for them so their strategy is different."

"&gt; Back then there was a full blown recession; right now the economy is strong.

would disagree. 2007-08 underwrote the longest recession since World War II and the most significant financial crisis since the Great Depression. Without the Fed stepping in with bailouts the (global) economy would have been devastated.

Nothing has fundamentally changed since the Great Recession and capitalism is increasingly finding profits through financial wizardry while the 'real economy' continues to suffer. The economy might look strong from a shareholder perspective, but real people are suffering and consumer debt is at an all-time high. Some people have predicted that US student debt could become the new 'subprime mortgage' bomb.

This is all to say that people should be thinking about the next financial crisis. That's not to say it's coming today, tomorrow or next week, but any shrewd investors plans for the worst and the only constant in capitalism is crisis.

"In some decks and metas it's worth using. It is not worth putting as a 3 of in every deck. It is definitely overrated with people calling it a staple. The fact that each one you play takes up your upgrade for the turn is the real problem with it, it's just not that helpful unless your opponent has a way to make a one attack kill against the character it is equipped to. I've found that upgrades that give a static armor bonus or tough are going to statistically reduce more damage than it while they are in play while using up less of my card plays.

They are supposed to be a new opponent, most likely to spawn in those villages that you find where all the doors are missing and all the villagers are already zombies.  The dark poppies are supposed to be their special drop, with the ability to get it uncorrupted so you can give it to a neutral mob (your cat, dog, parrot, horse, pig or whatever) an make it so that it can't die.  It would let you, with some real effort, make it so a pet wouldn't die, which is something a lot of players, I think, would like.  There are whole mods out there to make it so your pet is less likely to die.  (I'm actually a little worried on the implementation for that...

"Are you from Florida or Arizona? I personally got my ratings (up to commercial SEL) with a local shop and have had a great experience and saved money over a lot of the fast-track places. Not saying they aren't good options, but something to think about. Most schools will work with you at the pace you want, so you can often get the training done in the same timeframe as places that quote you three month (or less) PPLs. The cost of a hotel or Airbnb plus rental car &amp; eating out all the time will also make traveling to training more pricey.

If I had to choose between AZ and FL for training, I'd probably pick AZ. I have a few friends that moved down there to work as CFIs and it sounds like they're always flying. Pray Aviation in Kansas has a good reputation here, but I personally haven't used them. I used Accelerated Aviation Instruction out of KAEL for my multi and had a good experience.

Are there any flying clubs close to you? That's another great option to get your PPL, especially if you can find an instructor to work with you nearly full time."

"1. Just saying his powers showed up one day is fine if he's a meta, doesn't have to be complicated.

2. His strength is way too high; the most we've let someone have even with super strength is about 10 tons overhead lift, 15 or so for a deadlift. Other lifts would fit between those two. I'd say half the values and have those be his minotaur strength, then between 10-15 tons can be his human strength."

Which is a shame because gloomstalker Ranger was probably your best choice.

Paladin is a popular blend with assassins - I‚Äôd go vengeance if you progress that far. It‚Äôs mostly just increasing your first round damage.

Whispers Bard is another great thematic assassin blend, more damage and sneaking, and at Bard 10 magical secrets for Find Greater Steed can grab you a suitably dark mount to really lean into the grimdark aesthetic.

Shadow sorcerer gets you magic, extended darkvision, the darkness spell, and a spectral hound. It‚Äôs a good choice if you want some Spellcasting (Rogues love SCAGtrips)

"This. I guess it's gonna take some time for people to get used to it, but most of the time your teammates don't actually suck, it's you who sucks because you kill them.

Why not both?
"It scales off of shield size as well 1.5 %bonus health + 8.5 % shield size, meaning Riven with a shield size of 400 will deal around base damage + 34 every 4 seconds. Base +34 should be around 60 damage by then which is a pretty nice boost. 

Ornn for example with 3k health will deal slightly more damage than riven, but he scales harder since his shields scales with hp."

"This is a fun idea, and a really nice looking map. I get a kind of ""The Giver"" vibe, where the ruling elite is keeping the common people from knowing a fundamental truth. I can see most of the elite being evil, as the amount of fascism required to stop even the dockworkers from speaking about the lands outside would be extreme. A society under complete control, but also with a lie to keep the population in check -- ""the giant war is raging, we must soldier on.""

"It's hard to see the other person's side of things. I know that in my marriage I love to be complimented and hear good things from my spouse. My spouse is the opposite, he thinks if I'm giving compliments I want something  from him. Well you keep talking about how you feel because that's what you know. Maybe she is so exhausted after a hard day of raising kids, and household chores and work and every other responsibility she has she is literally to exhausted to worry about her weight. To you weight and exercise are a priority, but maybe to her making sure everyone's laundry is done, meals are made, homework is done is the priority and she's put herself on the bottom of that list. I am not saying this is right, but it may be where she currently is... 

I one time made a list of the 200+ things I do around the house to keep things moving along and everyone happy and healthy hoping to get my husband  to see ALL that I do, his response....

My point is, be patient, be kind, encouraging of the changes even if they are small and appreciate all of the many things she does do well. We are all just hanging on by a thread, right!?

"Have you been to a rural community lately? It's mostly all old people, or their foreign wives/children, and foreign migrant workers. There are no Koreans in their 20's.  Korean farmers will die earlier because typically they are 20 years older than their wives.  So that means the ones who are going to inherit the farms will be those foreign widows and/or their children. And then there will be a host of abandoned farms for those old Korean farmers right now who are in their last legs but don't have anybody to inherit the farms.  I doubt the Farmer's Union will survive the coming demographic calamity in the rural areas. That will force serious reforms whether anybody likes it or not.

"The Romans were really big on suicide. Kinda similar to the old Japanese, with the whole thing about honour and responsibility. 

My favourite story about this is Cato the Younger. He supported Pompey in the civil war against Caesar and when it became clear that Caesar would win, he decided to kill himself, as a proper Roman should. He took his sword and gutted himself. But as he fell, he knocked over a table in his tent and a servant found him before he died and was able to get medical help. When Cato woke up later, all stitched up, he was furious that he was denied his dignified end. So that cranky principled man ripped out and stitches and guts with his bare hands and died, presumably with a scowl on his face. "

I haven't encountered any hardware defects on my 3 XL, but the app killing, not saving pictures, speaker sound quality and audio recording quality are experience-killing issues that should be addressed.  The issues are so obvious that I don't understand how they weren't caught in testing before release.

If this was a $500 phone, I night look past it, or not make such a big deal over it.  But Google is selling pixels for $1000.  At this price range, the expectation is much higher and Google should continue to bed pressured to address these issues.

Honestly, of those 4 issues are fixed, I'll be a happy camper and defend this phone a bit more.  Until then, it deserves the criticism it's getting."

Varimyr is certain that he will not be able to shift again after he shifts into Thisle, but how would he really know?

I think it is very possible that no one really knows.  Maybe that power would eventualy return, as the skinchanger got more accustomed to a new body.  The ""Bolt-on"" theory gets a lot easier to believe if this is possible.

GRRM's biggest series is the Wild Card, where there was a similar problematic group of people that could swap bodies.  Basically they would steal your body and place your mind/soul in their old body.  They used it to force empowered hero's into some whimpy body (elderly or infirm), then they would kill/abandon the former ""ace"" in the whimpy body.

These villains were a huge problem for the heros over multiple books (3 or 4 I think).

Bolt-on could be a similar villain...

"Absolutely. The key thing to understand about capitalism is that it's not a system of government or economics, it's a force of nature. If I have something you want and you have something I want then we will make a trade. It's like osmosis. You can't legislate against osmosis, but you can put structures and systems in place that mitigate the damage it can do or maximise the good. In a capitalist utopia, all negative externalities are taxed to the degree that we can mitigate them entirely, while all positive externalities are subsidised to the extent they benefit society. It doesn't make any suggestions regarding governmental structure beyond requiring a government capable of performing those duties. Arguing that capitalism always ends in corporatism is as reductive as saying gravity will always pull you back down."

"Definitely ask him what he wants to try but never had the chance before. You don't want your lovely surprise to turn out to be something that grosses him out, or just flat out doesn't interest him.

Anyway, just some ideas below, but if you let us know what you've already tried or what you generally like, we can come up with better suggestions:

- Make him some ""coupons"" that he can use to redeem sexual favours from you. How many and the restrictions depends on how long he's here and what you're comfortable with, eg. ""blowjob/handjob right here right now"" is always a classic for this. Another variant: take an activity he doesn't like (eg shopping), and make it fun for him at every shop you visit.

- How's the weather at your end? If it's suitable, picnic in a cute sundress with some wine usually leads to good results. If you do it in the evenings, bench park sex is a definite option. Or you could both go catch a movie for an indoor version of this.

- Find a sport you can do together and dress appropriately to tease him while you're at it, but go for something that's indoors that you can work into a typical day at the mall. I'm thinking stuff like bowling, pool, etc. Even the good ol' foosball or that table game where you hit pucks to score goals can work with a simple low cut top. 

- ""Take off your panties"" will be fun, but you can try another variant. Either go for something really lacy or really plain, so it looks like a band. Make sure you show it to him before you go out. Halfway through a date, remove it in a restroom, but instead of giving it to him, use it to tie up your hair or wear it on your wrist. See how long it takes for him to notice and you can vary your reward for him accordingly.

- Are you familiar with r/GoneWildAudio? If you're not, check it out. After that, make a recording for him and leave it somewhere that he can find, like on your laptop. Or tell him you have a song to recommend and leave him to listen to it. Either do a roleplay script of what you'd like (make it classic cheesy 70s porn plot style if you want laughs with your sex) or just a short one of all the filthy nasty things you want to do to him. Or him to you. If you're doing this outside, you can sit and watch his expression. Pick somewhere that he has to be quiet, like a library or a nicer restaurant. If you're doing this at home, for the roleplay version you can leave him while you go get prepared without him knowing. Imagine if he has a cheerleader-coach fantasy (typical I know, but just an example), you give him a recording of that, and just as he finishes the audio you turn up in a little outfit. Or if he loves sloppy blowjobs, you make a recording of you making a mess of a large dildo or cucumber, and when he's done let him come find you in the middle of slobbering all over the dildo. "

"Think in terms of ""Try Fail Cycles"". The character has a problem (this makes it a story). The character tries to solve the problem. They either succeed, but their success causes some other issue (Yes, but), or they fail AND their failure causes some other issue (No, and). This way, you're always ramping up the stakes and conflict, and thinking this way helps plan a story. Eventually, you get to the end, where either the character has solved their problem and achieved something related to the other issues (Yes and) or they haven't solved their problem, but they've made some kind of peace or resolution with the issue (No but).

When I open the the scoreboard I can immediately see both the team's score and my own stats, their position never changes and I don't see any reason why rearranging it to accurately sort the players by their scores would be an improvement. Why does it matter what place you are in mid-match? How does it make the scoreboard more useful for you to have the position of your stats change around? "

"Dude you‚Äôre really dumb. You went rambling about MIRVs for no clear reason. But still manage to fuck it up.

&gt; The first true MIRV design was the Minuteman III, introduced in 1970,[2] which held three smaller W62 warheads of about 170 kilotons in place of the single 1.2 megaton W56 used in the earlier versions of this missile. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle

You might want to look when the Cuba missile crisis took place. The most dangerous thing there was a nuclear torpedo, where Masslennikov the political officer, the commander(forgot his name) of the sub both voted  to use the nuclear torpedo. The man that saved the earth that day was Vasili Arkhipov.

Now once you read up a bit on nuclear doctrine rather than having heard the word MIRV and thinking it explains everything. You would understand that the Russian nor  the US policy have duck all to do with credible deterrence as they would need a much tinier arsenal for that. You can start looking at China and India for countries where maybe you could talk about MAD. "

"People don't get god is an idea that most if not all humans experience to some degree. Some call it revelation, holy spirit, the Dao, Zen, etc., but the point of god is the personification of truth in relation to human experience. 

Many people think if we ""kill"" god people would be better off and progress could be made, but then we'd have to rediscover the meaning of traditions that are based on past humans living through experience. Even things like 'thou shalt not kill' and 'do unto others...' would need to be rediscovered.

Not having a will is not having a will. Not having a will because you want to lose is gamethrowing or else we need to ban everyone for gamethrowing because we were all new and didnt write wills.. anyways-

Yes i get what youre saying... if they KNOW that they should have a will because they know people r lynch happy for people without wills then yes, they r willfully lowering their chances of winning but like i said sometimes the people r new or maybe they just forgot to write one.. or maybe even they r sad asf that day and have no drive to write one.. u could argue that they arent intentionally not writing one.. there depression is preventing it lol.. so yeah.. not having a will is not having a will... not having a will because you‚Äôre trying to lose is gamethrowing.

Actually.. for it to be gamethrowing you actually have to want to lose... so yeah i can be lazy asf and not write a will and know that theres a 99% ill get lynched because of that but i can still want to win... it‚Äôs not like im intentionally going ‚Äúbody, i want u to be lazy‚Äù u know what i mean? So its not intentional and i still want to win and thus im not really gamethrowing.. 

For it to be gamwthrowing id have to say to myself ‚ÄúIm not going to write this will because i want to lose‚Äù u get what i mean?

So yeah unless you want to argue that im choosing to be lazy when i decide not to write a will as an evil which i surely know is gonna get me lynched then im not gamethrowing.. besides, in practice, you cant read the minds of people that r on the stand without a will.. u dont really know why they dont have one."

Title: **Signed A Contract That Said ""No Refunds"" - Surprise, I Got Screwed**

Original Post: 

&gt; I'm looking to take a website development company I contracted to court over breach of contract. They were hired to do logo design and website design, and claimed to be award-winning developers &amp;amp; designers. They delivered their 5 days late, and it was atrocious quality. The client I contracted them for was very unhappy, and as everything moved forward they became increasingly difficult. 
&gt; 
&gt; The attempts at logos were so bad we immediately contracted a contest to crowdsource design, which worked. We hoped they would build the website, but were not able to. They did put up a homepage, but no one was happy with it, and after that we pulled the plug.   
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have since hired a new team, and everything else is moving along fine. 
&gt; 
&gt; The contract says ""no refunds"", but they didn't deliver on anything they were contracted to do. They failed to design a good logo, and the website they put up is terrible. However, they technically put up a homepage, and designed an awful logo. 
&gt; 
&gt; What are the chances I can recoup my investment in small claims?

"It's not that difficult imo: just tie the rating to a score value for completing certain tasks, like killing enemies, having no soldier casualties/fatalities after a mission, completing optional objectives, etc. Then reward the player with bonuses based on the total score earned along with a medal or something. Thus, instead of just scout-rushing maps in one turn, you actually need to be thorough and efficient to get the best result. 

For a more recent example of such a thing, XCOM 2's Legacy Ops features a similar grading system.  "

"I lost a good bit but that‚Äôs part of the learning process. I never risked enough to lose big though. When I first started I thought you had to execute the option or sell it but get burdened with the liability (lol) so I let a lot of options expire worthless. But I‚Äôve since learned that is not the case. 

But I never have sold any options to open. That‚Äôs not something I know how to reliably hedge yet and in general think it‚Äôs an easy way to lose money unless you really know what you‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôm looking into selling short term ATM options but will never sell an OTM option which is all that I buy. 

Most of my money though I don‚Äôt do anything with unless I‚Äôm hedging a short term put option. It usually stays in T bills or something. Sometimes I‚Äôll buy a short term spy put option and I‚Äôll buy a lot of spy stocks with a stop loss sell on it. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the proper way to do things but that‚Äôs what I be doing and it stops me from losing a lot, actually I really wouldn‚Äôt lose a lot anyway because the most I‚Äôve ever paid for a single contract is 40 dollars. (And I don‚Äôt really buy more than 2 or 3 at a time) 

The money I make is fairly small so far, but percentage wise it‚Äôs large. It‚Äôs tempting to put a larger portion in and instead of turning $20 into $150 putting $2000 in and making $12000. But the possibility of losing that much stops me. As I make more I can afford to risk more and I also know more so I‚Äôm more comfortable but I still wouldn‚Äôt play around with much more than 10% of your portfolio. 

Stay away from selling unless you really know how to hedge (with certainty) don‚Äôt risk that much. When you do lose scale back on the risks. Psychologically, when you buy an option you should consider that money gone. Go in with the assumption that you‚Äôre going to lose it. If you like consider it paying for some entertainment. That way it stops you from overbuying and being too disappointed 

That‚Äôs my philosophy anyway. "

The right is more prone to conspiracy theories because the right has less moderates than the left. So there are more alt-righter on the right than alt-lefties on the left.

"If I remember correctly, Fabletown is surrounded by very strong spells that prevent mundies from suspecting anything about the Fables' peculiarities (said spells are also how they conceal the Farm's existence).

What happens if a mundie discovers the Fables' secret has never gotten an in-depth explanation. Flashbacks depict Bigby outing himself as the Big Bad Wolf to his fellow WWII soldiers to save their lives, but they kept their mouths shut about his secret. The only mundie shown to discover the 'truth' about the Fables was Tommy Sharp, but he thought they were vampires and ended up getting killed by Bluebeard before anything drastic could happen"

I got prompted for the update to 1.13.2 since I hadn't logged on to this world lately.  And the moment I opened the map, I could see something had changed.  The 'x' was no longer right at the edge of the waterline, but slightly further out.  Only a pixel or two, but enough to be a few blocks off.

When I sailed back out there, I discovered the pit I'd dug was no longer centered under the 'x'.  Now that marker was just a bare two blocks outside the waterlogged edge of the pit.  This time, it appears to be correct as there's a chest there.

Seed is -9057352651117540831.  The 'x' was originally centered on x510/z-297.  The actual chest, and adjusted 'x' post 1.13.2, is at x521/z-294.  Not terribly far off, but almost exactly enough that you wouldn't find it widening a dig centered on the original spot.

Before everyone leaps down my throat, let me point out that if I was interested in trolling, I'd have just lied or declined to give up the seed.  I can't for the other world with the first two in it anyway as I deleted it, but this one you can search.

Interestingly, this chest did not appear to follow the ""it's just slightly south of the marker"" rule I've seen bandied about here."

"@brian9000 @blolfighter: You're both missing an important detail here: Lot's daughters' sons are named Moab and Ammon, i.e. the sons they have are supposedly the founders of two nations near Israel. They had wars with both and at one point, Moab was a vassal state to Israel. They were culturally similar to Israel. The story of Ruth concerns a Moabite adopted into Israel, etc.

This isn't a story about rape or incest. It's a ""talking shit about your neighbors"" story/propaganda piece. It's saying they're both products of incest that narrowly escaped Sodom and Gomorrah. After getting out of the Babylonian Captivity, the Hebrews got into racial purity in a big way. They made it taboo to intermarry with... specifically the nearby Moabites and Ammonites. Wouldn't be at all surprised if this story was added right around that time."

"The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:

**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.

**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  

**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. 

**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. 

**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. 

**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. 

**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.

Thank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.

The cage looks great. I would suggest to make it higher or close it on top cause even if you think they can't escape hamsters will try and try and try till they can. Smart of you to get a travel box. I never understood how they can put hamsters in a cardboard box. Mine chewed herself out of it in a minute. Luckily she was in the cage already. I've never used a water bottle but just a normal bowl of water as I've heard that they prefer that in most cases cause it's more natural for them. Your cage looks really nice! If you want to give your hamster a really nice treat give him or her grasshoppers or worms. It's a natural food source for them in the wild and hamsters are such good hunters. You can buy it at a pet shop where they also have reptiles or buy it online. Best to give it alive cause sometimes they won't take it if It's dead.  It's full of protein and that's what they need. I also gave them oats sometimes mixed with water. They love that and it's better than those hamster sweets.
"Great Old Ones, or GOO, are more backbone casters than anything else. They specialize in battlefield shaping control and utility. 

That said, boon wise, Pact of the Chain is best for them as GOO is primarily Domineering and Utility. These familiars are smarter than normal ones and are awesome for scouting. They come with spells and abilities that you normally wouldn't have. While their attack isnt that good in terms of damage, it's more of a spell than attack as they give poison or the like, so it's more utility. They can give a hand in combat, as well as out of combat, using the ""help"" action. The shared senses give a strong perception check. 3 of the 4 have invisibility, but the 4th is a pseudodragon! I'm a bit biased... xD

"Interesting how you completely ignored evidence that Rodger held alt-right beliefs and talked about your dislike of the SPLC instead.

Also, no, I wasn't saying left wing = amazing and right wing = terrible. I was saying that the goal of left wing politics is to get everyone on an equal playing field in which they all have the same civil rights. One way that the left is doing this is by fighting the attempts of many on the right to deny rights to Muslims based on the actions of a select few of them.

If someone commits an act of terror as a result of their left wing beliefs, they're a terrorist. That guy who tried to kill the congressman playing a baseball game was a left wing terrorist. If someone commits an act of terror as a result of their right wing beliefs, they're a terrorist. Every single example I listed has evidence that the person carrying out the attack was far right and their actions ocurred as a result of their beliefs. The reason it seems like my definition is broad is because there are *way* more examples of people being terrorists due to being right wing than there are of people being terrorists due to people being left wing. It's the same goddamn definition for both. Carry out an act of terror while owning a bunch of propaganda for a political party and espousing your motives that line up with that political party's beliefs? That'd make ya a terrorist.

The link you gave me didn't work, so I used [this one.](http://www.fox32chicago.com/news/man-who-threatened-to-kill-all-white-people-charged-in-6-murders) I *wouldn't* classify that man as a left wing terrorist due to the fact that he's schizophrenic. He should be held accountable for what he did, yes, but his actions were not carried out as a result of a political ideology held by someone of rational mind. If you can provide info with a credible source that any of the examples I used occurred for similar reasons, I will happily remove them from the list."

If both groups cared about their stance, they would embrace people that didn't believe in it and try to change their mind.

And it still shouldn't be filled with bullshit answers like ""CrOoKeD HiLaRy"" or ""TrUmP iS RaCiSt."". It should be actual reasons.  Memes are okay, but they shouldn't be the central theme.

That's called letting you off easy. It requires no need for me to explain myself. For me to be vulnerable or expose myself to additional rejection.  Seriously, think about it, IF she likes you... instead of you telling her it was nice to share the bed with her or something (was it at all? be honest).. to which she could have said 'I liked it too', looking past the awkward points. But no, you present it to her like it's an abnormality that she tried to get cozier with you. Girl doesn't want to try to have that awkward conversation, she already felt rejected, she doesn't want to risk it more, and/or she realized how obtuse you are and became less attracted to you.

&amp;#x200B;

fwiw there were a handful of times in college that I completely missed clues from girls I liked and was attracted to, where we were hanging out alone, on a bed or in my place, and they continued to make subtle contact with me, etc, but I missed it. However I had just gotten out of a 2yr relationship and was not over it, mentally processing things. Maybe it would have helped me get over my ex to have picked up on their moves and seen where it went, but also maybe i was subconsciously protecting myself from additionally emotionally vulnerable by having more than a friendship with those gals. I can tell you though, we remained friends, but they definitely moved on."

How many cases wouldn‚Äôt be classed as unsolved if the police were bungling idiotic morons?"

This, this is absolutely moronic.

But not in Europe, where ""the best intentions and initiatives"" will apparently carry no penalties whatsoever for companies/people damaging the environment somewhere else, up to and including banning their goods?

"&gt; great idea for a MAIN end game, but a not so good idea for Side core mechanic.

I said it before but delve tries to do two things at once by providing an interesting side area with nice loot (currency, shaper elder items, old league stuff etc) and on the other side an endless dungeon to test your char and compete. The first is balanced really well after the latest sulphite changes however the second isnt. Delve needs to scale faster in difficulty to make competition more interesting. D3 with rifts and grifts even if its a stale endgame has this balance a bit better. 

And i cant agree more with the messy endgame part. Some people might find it interesting to have all these mechanics at full potential in maps but i dont want a single map to take half an hour to hour including the micromanagment of loot and preparation. There is a point where there is too much of something."

"Thank you very much for your comments. They're very helpful, and I see I will have a lot of nitpicking to do. But I just have one question, which requires a short background.

When I was writing this, I was never intentionally making it out to sound Victorian; I guess, just influenced by. But when I was typing down the contents of this post, I thought ""long-winded, and dense sentences"" sounded so off-putting. So instead, I replaced it with ""victorian-esque sentences, and language"" without really thinking about how it would change the perception of my readers (however, that's already very telling of how even I perceived it).

I know there's nothing I can do about this anymore, but I hope it won't be too much to ask you this question:

""If you had not been told that my story had a Victorian style to it, do you think you would have come to the same conclusions regarding my word choices? Or do you think that you would have picked up along the way that there was something Victorian about the prose, and come to the same conclusion you just posted?""

I'm not saying that I think your critique is misguided, I find it extremely useful. I guess I'm just looking for a final confirmation for how far I need to go with this Victorian style."

"Glad I could say some things to get the gears grinding. You need to have these conversations with her, but feeling it out with your guy friends first (since they know the context of your life) is definitely your go-to option, followed by your dad/family if you need more advice, and then open up the conversation with her. Communication is KEY, and something I learned after many stupid years of not talking things through directly with my partner. It doesn't have to be ""hey babe, we need to talk"" -- you can casually bring it up when the time is right, and let the conversation flow. Preferably out somewhere while doing something fun like dinner / walking... just in case things get stale you can focus back on the night instead of wallowing at home and both festering your thoughts.

Good luck homey, hope you find your way. I also advocate for hobbies, if you both have something that envelops your time other than work, it's a good way to be together while doing your own thing. For you that can be gym, arts, audiobooks, drones, building models, online chess, etc. For her it can be painting classes, zumba, crochet, platform games, music, volunteering... whatever the mind craves."

"I didn't assume you were any gender. I'm just letting you know that the sex of other people has literally nothing to do with any opinions you may have. Most people have sex with no intention to get pregnant. Pregnancy can be a consequence of sex -- it isn't always. Just like a car accident can be a consequence of driving. Two normal everyday things that can possibly have life-changing consequences. 

Just because someone has the audacity to get into a car or have sex, doesn't mean they need to automatically accept a life-changing consequence. You can't force someone to carry a fetus, pay medical bills, and undergo the physical and mental strain of a decision they didn't make -- that you want to make for them. Just as you definitely can't force someone to get into a car accident. There may be a drunk driver heading right towards them and they can still steer out of the way. No one has to be hit with a car 100% of the time. No one has to have a baby 100% of the time. "

But there is also nothing wrong with doing some research into dog breeds before you set out to purchase a specific breed of dog from a breeder or pet store. My previous comment is about people who purchase specific breeds from breeders or pet shops without doing their research, or not caring about it because ""omg cuuuuute"". I also take particular issue with people who breed unhealthy dogs as show dogs. I'm talking about not supporting an industry that profits on breeding unhealthy animals and making sure these unhealthy animals don't procreate, not rounding up unhealthy animals and euthanizing them."

You're not the only one who did, and your personal anecdote aside I can tell you that your claim is flat out false.

That's almost a full third of US Catholics. 

http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/30/5-facts-about-evolution-and-religion/

""Seen as a myth"" that is most definitely not. 

&gt; nuts... Don't come from Rome

Clearly this statement isn't true either, as a whole third of US Catholics show us otherwise! And if you look at the stats a little closer, you'll see that your (frankly, a little bigoted) generalization of Protestants doesn't really stand up to the broad stroke 'us vs those stupid Protestants' Catholic tribalism that I am *quite* familiar with, as more Catholics deny evolution than does the group ""white mainline Protestants"".

"It's like I said, consent can't be proven, and therefore the likelihood of a man getting accused of rape is equal to him not being accused of it regardless of consent. If bubba want's a piece of my ass, that's fine, but the truth is that, that ass will get fed, sheltered and taken pretty decent care of, all under the taxpayer's dime. So at the end of the day, people going to jail for rape, regardless of obtaining consent or not as consent cannot be proven, are actually fucking the taxpayer in the ass. Bubba my have my ass, but he and every other man put in jail for a crime based on evidence that inherently cannot be proven as a matter of fact is actually fucking you and every other tax payer in the ass.

"Waste of money.  Stock forged rods dont fail on these.  Really, ever.  The block splits from vibration and HP.  If you run it to redline alot and are at or above 500hp, it is likely to split.

Leave the guts.  The pistons are fine of they are forged or hypereutectic.  Put heads on it, boost it to about 9psi, you'll have 500 reliable HP at the crank if you dont beat the shit out of it.

If you want above 500, start with an aftermarket block like Dart.

You dont need aftermarket efi.  Stock is fine with a big pump and 80lb injectors to about 600 hp with a tuner like Moates.  Stock rails, stock lines.

If you blow the stock pistons, you went lean or had too much timing.

"Well hai there, I was in an extremely toxic fandom before. There was this car chat which I was really getting into, and next thing I know, these nazis start following me around, and it all started in ye olde car chat. Swastikas everywhere, and the anti-Semitism rampant, so I left. These guys thought it was funny to follow me out and personally message me, and I couldnt block them, the alt accounts were strong with them so I ignored them. Next thing I know (I use that phrase all the time) I'm getting death threats in the personal messages from a guy shouting stuff about how he was a marine and macho and how he killed Bin Laden (even though those were Navy SEALs) and it was getting annoying. He suddenly switched to army from marines, and that's about when I decided to uninstall the app and completely forget anything happened because he knew what state I lived in after guessing randomly like five times, and I knew this wasn't going anywhere.. I've gotten happier since I left the anti-Semites behind, I'll tell you that much.

"if i'm being what the kids like to call ""honest"", something just tells me this isn't made by Nitro. i mean seriously, the app looks completely different and has an IPTV client built-in now. looks way worse than the original imo, and the site is just some generic BigCartel website.

i just feel like there's no way Nitro made this. it really seems more like another app riding off TTV's fame.

edit: wow i just realized.. the youtube channel's owner probably made it, or collaborated with someone else to do it. you can see it easily, glitchIPTV is advertised on the TTVPlus site, and the guy's channel banner matches the glitch logo. they both use the same BigCartel format site. 

but mostly i got that from the fact that if you go to glitch's site and scroll all the way down, the ""back to the main site"" button just leads to the guy's youtube channel.

he's pretty scummy for doing this to his viewers in my opinion, unacceptable."

"The expectation on the tests at least for when I give it out or the ones I have been assigned towards the end of an interview process is that you likely won't spend much time on it, you likely won't pay for stock images, and you won't use pay for use fonts. Throw as much time into as you want of course, that's up to you. All of it is sort of implied as those interviewing will hopefully already have expectations of how much you'd put into it.  Of course you're free to gauge how much you feel like putting into it. If its for a dream job of yours at the time you'll put more effort into it. Less effort for a shitty job. My original point is simply if you decline, you weed yourself out. I have never declined but I have put less effort into certain test projects."

For measuring your head you'll need to take a few different measurements. You can use a length of string (that you will have to hold up to a tape measure). Place the string around your head about 1/8"" above your ear, across the mid-forehead, completely circling your head. Then Mark the string right where it meets and measure it. Then based on the mask itself you measure the height in the same way from the top of your head to wear the mask is supposed to stop. (Since Daredevil stops halfway down the face I only measured halfway down my face.) So long story short it seems like there's a lot of mystery to it but it's stupid easy.

Forbes needs to find evidence of your net worth being at least $1 billion USD.

Net  worth means assets minus liabilities. So if you own all of a company  and sell it for exactly $1 billion, you won‚Äôt be considered a  billionaire due to tax liabilities you would incur on the sale.

That‚Äôs pretty much it. It‚Äôs a pretty simple definition.

Of  course a more interesting question is how Forbes is able to determine  wealth for certain people whose assets are not in publicly held  companies. It‚Äôs fairly straightforward to determine the net worth of  someone like Mark Zuckerberg, most of whose wealth is held in Facebook  stock. It‚Äôs much harder to calculate wealth for someone like Donald  Trump, most of whose wealth is tied up in privately held real estate  development partnership, and with whom Forbes has had many disagreements  in the past over the size of his wealth."
"I think every woman--whether you have been or are in an abusive relationship or not--should read Lundy Bancroft's *Why Does He Do That*? Myself and many of my friends and family members have been in abusive relationships with men and reading this book answered a lot of questions I was seeking about how to avoid abusers. Identifying patterns of behaviour, recognising red flags, listening to your intuition, countering stereotypes and misinformation about abuse, abuse tactics, and abuse victims. The author is a man, but IIRC he does not shy away from discussing male violence and how it's normalised. "
"Your boyfriend can open the following:

1) IRA--either traditional or roth.  This is available to every one with earned income so doesn't require an employer to sponsor it.

2) An HSA if enrolled in a compatible high deductible health plan.  Since he doesn't get health insurance from his employer, he can enroll into a HDHP.  Likely, he can enroll through the healthcare.gov exchange in order to get the premium subsidies.  Remember when reporting income, use your modified adjust gross income, which is line 37 on his 1040.  Also unless you're married, you're not part of his household and thus your income doesn't count.  Also if he decides to enroll in an HSA, remember to deduct whatever HSA contributions he plans to make to help reduce his MAGI.  If his income is low enough, he may qualify for medicaid which if he takes, won't let him contribute to a HSA, but on the other hand his healthcare costs are going to be very low.  Anyway with an HSA, he can contribute $3500 in 2019 if enrolled in a single plan or $7000 in a family plan.  They work by allowing you to contribute the money tax free like a traditional IRA, grow tax free and withdraw the the money tax free like a roth IRA to pay for qualified medical expenses.

The thing is that there is no time limit on when you need to reimburse yourself, so people are using them like super-IRAs and paying their medical expenses out of pocket with the intent of reimbursing themselves for tax free income.  The only thing you need to do is keep copies of the receipts in case you're audited.  Also at age 65 when you're on medicare, if you've run out of qualified medical expenses, you can still withdraw the money penalty free, you just pay ordinary income tax like you would with a traditional IRA.  Though at that age you'll likely have ongoing medical expenses to use the money on.

3) If your boyfriend is a 1099, he can open a solo 401K.  The contribution limits are the same as a regular 401K, he can contribute $18,500 in employee elective deferrals and additional 20% of net business income (minus 1/2 of self employment) in employer profit sharing, up to a combined max of $55K.  The only caveats with this is no full time employees (those working 1000 hours/year or more) except your spouse.  And when you reach $250K in assets, you need to file form 5500.

If he's eligible, he needs to set it up before December 31, 2018 for the contributions to count for 2018.  he can make the contributions as late as his tax filing date (April 15th, 2019), though in order to enroll he needs to have an EIN from the IRS and the application needs to be mailed or faxed in, so don't procrastinate.

If he can open a solo 401K, read this article that explains the different free plans from the top 5 brokerages:

https://thecollegeinvestor.com/18174/comparing-the-most-popular-solo-401k-options/

4) If after contributing to a IRA, HSA and possibly 401K, he still has money to contribute, then he can contribute to a taxable brokerage.  

As for his credit woes, as others have explained, he'll need to start with either a starter credit card or likely a secure card.  Have him use it like a debit (meaning only buy things he has the cash on hand to pay with).  Make sure that he waits until the statement posts before paying the full statement balance.  If he pays early and there is zero balance when the statement posts, then nothing gets sent to the credit bureaus and he loses out on payment history that helps increase his credit score.  

Sign up for Credit Karma to monitor his credit.  As it improves, get new cards.  Don't close the old card, keep it and do a product change instead.  That will allow him to upgrade the card, but preserve the card's history.  

Don't close any card out unless you have to.  If the card has an annual fee, do a product change to one that does not.  Also if he ever gets to a point where he has a card he doesn't use, still use it--once or twice a year--to keep it active so the card company doesn't close it out due to inactivity.  Having more cards and longer history will improve his score.  Just be careful not to pay interest if he can avoid it and not too over spend.  If he uses it responsibly, it's an incredible tool in his financial arsenal and will help him down the line when he needs to apply for a home or car loan as an improved credit score allows for larger borrowing at lower interest rates.

Edit:  I also would like to add, while I'm not positive about this, if he goes with an HSA, if his employer can make the contributions through payroll, then both of them can save on the 7.65% FICA taxes.  You can give them your HSA's routing and account number and direct deposit it that way.

As for IRA, HSA and solo 401K recommendations, for IRA and solo 401K, I recommend Vanguard, Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade and eTrade.  For the HSA, I recommend Lively as they're the least expensive HSA that allows access to a full brokerage account.  They charge no admin fees, but do charge $2.50/month to trade using TD Ameritrade.  Also they don't deduct the $2.50/month fee from your HSA like other administrators do, thus preserving your tax free growth.  Also for the solo 401K, read the article I posted as not all brokerages offer the same type of plan."

"Our difference my friend is that i have already preordered the game, as i stated before in our conversation. I love battlefield games, played every single one except bad company 1. 
My point that i dont think u understand (cause u avoid it all the time) is that, content that was promised in the game before launch, will come after.
It was my bad for reffering to BR. It wasnt really a major content for a triple A game. But comparing it to battlefield's only rival, which is call of duty, makes it a loss comparing to them. But lets forget this. 

The fact that a major feature which is co op is coming after launch is really dissapointing. Missing gameplay features is also a let down. Missing BR isnt my main concern, dont get me wrong. I already believed it would come after. But i dont understand why they would promise features if they are not ready to implement them. Doesnt this bother u at all? "

"This example is the same as the first one, it assumes an equality between value of animals. One might have the moral belief that all animals are worth equally, and in turn deserve equal treatment, in which case your logic pretty much always holds. However, this moral belief isn't something that is necessarily shared by everyone. You claim that there is no deep reason to think that they deserve different treatment, but a person who cares about dogs doesn't necessarily believe that farm animals deserve to suffer. It's just that they have a reason to care about dogs, but not about farm animals. 

Person A will claim that he hates when dogs suffer, not because he likes animals, but because he likes dogs. The reason he likes dogs is probably because of memories and experiences of dogs. He doesn't have these same experiences with farm animals, and therefore doesn't hate when they suffer.

Indeed, being a pet lover and not an animal lover might seem as a morally odd position, but not necessarily a logically inconsistent one."

"Not in every MMO, it's amazing that you actually think that.
Take the granddaddy of MMOs, where the endgame is actually about politics, killing Richard Garriott and summoning dragons in battle royales.

WoW's basic world gameplay is so weak that it's easy to forget it used to be the foundation of the old MMOs. Funneling exclusively into instanced PvP and PvE content as endgame is distinctly a WoW thing.

And any MMO that wants to compete with WoW needs to flesh that out as a strong point, because all WoW copycats will lose their players to WoW. But for some reason investors are only interested in stepping on WoW's toes instead of focusing on what it doesn't offer. 

Star Citizen is the only MMO with a radically different take on the horizon, and that's purely because of its crowdfunded nature and momentum.

I don't understand how so many WoW fans don't even realize what's missing from this game."

"I've been tinkering with Morphtronics the past few days and, while I don't see them as being top-tier at the moment, they're a great Synchro engine and, with Yusei's Level Adjustment skill, they're quite versatile and can summon a number of Synchro monsters besides Power Tool Dragon. Not to mention, unlike Scraps, Konami gave us most of the necessary cards in the last pack, so they're not missing anything crucial. We have Celfon for a searcher that can potentially load the field, Slingen for removal, and Scopen for easy Synchro summons. Not to mention, Power Tool Dragon is a fantastic boss monster.

The main problem with the deck is, of course, it's crippling weakness to Canadia, but with proper backrow removal that can easily be countered. I don't see it becoming top tier any time soon, but it's definitely a decent rogue deck and will only get better as more powerful Synchro monsters are released and the deck becomes less reliant on Power Tool Dragon.

Overall, though, I've been having fun this format. It's the first format in over a year that I've played in so I haven't had to suffer through the really bad formats, though."

"New stadium has zero effect on new signings. This argument has been brought up numerous times, but no, it‚Äôs not the case. Also, there is absolutely no circumstance where I‚Äôd rather play in a brandnamed Bernabeu opposed to a new one. When it was being discussed two or three years ago, people were vehemently against putting a brand name next to the man who was so important to this club, but now people have somehow correlated it w/ an inability to afford new signings if we want to make the purchase. That‚Äôs not the case. The cost is spread out over 35 years. It‚Äôs not going to affect the club‚Äôs ability to pay transfer fees, which are already amortized over the length of the contract.

"They're not doing anything with fiber. The deal is basically they provide capital to LUS to upgrade the electric grid, and customer rates are frozen for a few years. Then they'll jack up rates so they can recoup costs and reap profits. 

Right now with LUS we're paying about 8.4 cents per KWH. Compare that to the average in Texas at 11.3 cents or California at 15.2 cents. 

I would much prefer LUS and LPUA to see slightly increase our rates now so that LUS can afford some much needed upgrades soon, while not involving a 3rd party private company (NextGen) that will expect profits. 

Edit: About getting fiber to Carencro... I'd recommend talking to your city council about it. They basically need to initiate a deal/partnership/whatever with LUSFiber to share the costs of running fiber to Carencro. "

"Those claims will not give you the land personally I'm 99% sure but impossible to tell without other screens.  If you take 2 more counties in Ireland, you'll have &gt;51% of De Jure Ireland and can form the kingdom.  Once you form the kingdom you'll have claims on all land in Ireland.  Since you have De Jure claims at that point, most vassals will just outright accept vassalization when you ask them since you're already at demesne limit (Duchy of Laigan probably won't accept).  Those who don't you should be more than strong enough to take.  You shouldn't need any mercs to clean up Ireland, you're more than strong enough.  Remember to get commanders with good traits.  Also make sure you've gotten rid of gavelkind.  I'm guessing you started in 1066 with the character you have, so it's been more than 10 years as a ruler and you can change laws to primogeniture.



edit:  Btw I forget the exact numbers but I think it's 200 gold, 200 piety or something along those lines to form Ireland, start saving up.  Looks like you're fine with piety.

Nice title. Understated but direct. Effective. You have a fine career in management ahead of you.
"well i have the same issue, but it has to be cause the zombies"
"&gt; + is a good start, but you should understand that IT is a lifelong learning event and you will end up with a shelf of thick books that you've cultivated your skills from. You should consider more advanced certifications (MCSE, VCP, CCNA/JNCP etc..) in addition to a college degree. While you are studying, see if there aren't any opportunities at the college for internship or helping out at a lab so you can get those references. Volunteering for local IT jobs to manage someones website and desktop pcs may help garner references and the experience you may be lacking but may only be good for small IT shops.
&gt; 
&gt; Also consider that if you are applying for enterprise class IT you will have much more difficulty getting the job despite your comfort with the desktop computer. That requires more infrastructure knowledge that you will need to familiarize yourself with. Setup a home lab environment and learn how to configure and manage it through the tools available. Do not forget to familiarize yourself with powershell if you work primarily on a Windows platform or bash for linux/mac.

Well I have a 2 year general studies degree... fact of the matter is I am 40 I do not have time to devote infinite time to this and I am not looking for a career to make $100,000 a year.

"I would rather see Okogie (only shooting open shots) run more with the first unit, run the offense through Butler and Towns and have Okogie running his ass off guarding top players and see Wiggins and Rose leading second unit in scoring. 
I just think on defense he brings more energy and I‚Äôd like to see an offense focused more on Butler (for now) and Towns. 

There would obviously be missing throughout the game and Wiggins would carry more minutes overall - be curious how that would play out."

I'm much more pessimistic that most vendors who claim to do such a thing can provide a pricing model for the inference delivery component of their product that is sustainable for them while also generally scalable for the end user. 

Some models you call a few times per hour or for microbatches, others you call multiple times per second with extremely low latency. Intuitively you should charge more for the second one, but can you do that for less than it would cost for the customer to serve that model themselves? I think that most vendors won't be able to do that. "

"Mask deniers, and the lack of conclusive studies.

Another said ""Face mask use in health care workers has not been demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds. A larger study is needed to definitively establish noninferiority of no mask use."" 32 people in that study, folks. 32!

"\&gt;""humility comes from those who dont ask for anything in return ""

This is incorrect. Humility comes only from God as He sanctifies you, and grants you to genuinely believe the Truth. Trying to be humble is a part of that, but the actual change only comes from God. Rather, we are commanded to ask God for what we want, and to keep asking. Sometimes we don't perceive a response, but rest assured every prayer affects you and your future. (Make sure sin is not hindering your prayers.)

*Ask* ***and*** *keep on asking and it will be given to you; seek* ***and*** *keep on seeking and you will find; knock* ***and*** *keep on knocking and the door will be opened to you.¬†For  everyone who keeps on asking receives, and he who keeps on seeking  finds, and to him who keeps on knocking, it will be opened. Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will \[instead\] give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will \[instead\] give him a snake?*   (Matthew 7:7-10, AMP)

One thing God sometimes does through prayer is mature our thinking about a subject we keep praying about. Another thing is He sometimes helps our perspective to be more like His own, or gives us fresh understanding of something.

When you pray about someone else, it may be useful to consider how what you pray is in accordance or contrary to that person's will. Everyone has free will, and God respect theirs just as much as yours. Also, consider whether what you are praying for is something God desires. For example, God wants everyone to be saved, so pray for them even if the person themself doesn't. Another example: asking God to make someone love you is fine, but as you mature spiritually, your request will also have the aroma of wanting the Lord's will to be done, because He knows what is best. (He might answer such a prayer by transforming *you* to be more attractive to her.)

It is very important to *persist* in asking for *all* of the most important things you want, though. The reason should normally be because they are things you need or desire, but do not have the capability to get. The Lord is very generous, but our sin and sin around us blocks His gifts and answers from getting to us (Daniel 10:12-13, Ephesians 6:12). Persist in prayer and ask others to pray for you for the same thing.

*And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.* (Ephesians 6:18, 1984 NIV)

Asking the Lord to show her your good qualities, or to make you such that her friends will look favorably on you are more likely to produce short-term results IMO, because they do not require that she change first."

Pretty fucked up I guess. Lots of drugs and domestic violence with the new boyfriend to the point that social services stepped in. Once that happened she made enemies of the social worker to the point that the social worker hated her guts enough to want to take her kids away. I literally didn't have to do anything other than show up to court. Social services paid for everything because I had to travel to a different city for court and their lawyer represented me. I imagine there might have been some issue had his mother showed up for court to defend herself. It got adjourned like 5 times because she wasn't showing up until finally the judge said fuck it and we proceeded with the case which obviously wasn't very hard to win considering she wouldn't even show up to court.

"&gt; Why do you get to seperate communists from liberals, but i cant seperate white nationalists from conservatives? If were both being honest we can see that they are all quite seperate. But you were talking about left and right. Its silly to say communists dont count as left.

...alright, just between you and me, I actually think communism counts as a form of liberalism. The communists will all get very angry at me over that, though, so let‚Äôs not argue that point.

More relevant is the fact that the Cold War is over and left-wing terrorism has been basically nonexistent since it ended.

&gt; And thats my whole point. Whenever someone on the left commits violence, its an isolated incident. Not even worth counting. But when someone on the right commits violence, its endemic, and im supposed to own them and answer for them.

Well... yeah. That‚Äôs my point. Even right-wing institutions like [the Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/blog/terrorism-deaths-ideology-charlottesville-anomaly) admit that right wing political violence is ten times as common as left wing political violence.

Like, I get that this feels unfair, but it‚Äôs *true*. The right has a political violence problem and the left doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs just what the situation is.

&gt; Why cant we both understand that neither one of us has a damn thing to do with these crazy people. And that things that they did should not reflect on you nor me? Thats all im saying.

"Hiking, rock climbing, birding, kayaking, fishing, nature photography, camping, or any one of many other outdoorsy hobbies.

Sure, not every outdoor hobby is easily doable in all places, but I would bet you probably have a few opportunities nearby.

Now that is a great reply! Thank you for a great comment. I agree with a lot of your comments despite my love for the film. Though I‚Äôm not sure where all these scenes or implications of rape are aside from the rape scene in the unrated version of the film. And there was just as much sex in the original (just not as graphic but it was also 1978)as there is in the remake. Also aside from his step dad that he kills in the beginning and the guards he kills to escape I don‚Äôt get how his other victims are bad people that make him seem less evil? You saying he should have remade The Texas Chainsaw Massacre really does make sense though. It would have been much more fitting with his style. Great discussion!

What?
"&gt; It seems like a pretty fundamental and striking difference

How? If you train yourself to shoot bows, what do you think would really change by being say a neuroscientist who can describe how the training works? Its more of a *meta* thing than it is a thing that *changes* how you do it. It might seem like philosophy of knowledge is necessary for knowledge, but that's not really what it does. Knowledge is something we can kind of just intuitively do. The philosophy is more about explaining *why* it works. 

&gt;Not a necessity for action, sure. But for knowledge?

Think of it this way. Knowing how knowledge works is not the same as knowing things. This only seems like a distinct case because it seems too meta, since it is about knowledge itself. But for the same reason that knowing how muscles work isn't necessary to exercise, knowing how knowledge works isn't necessary to use it. The truth is that you don't *need* to justify it in some kind of fundamental absolute way, because the reality is that all knowledge in practice is kind of provisional. And epistemology doesn't raise it much higher than that. You don't need absolute knowledge to ""know"" with a good degree of certainty certain facts.

The point you seem to be getting on is the fact that everyday knowledge is not absolute. But that will always be the case. Epistemology can't change that you will never be some kind of omniscient type being whose knowledge has no limitations or mereology. *However*, in practice we would say that it isn't really a good approach to say that that means you can't know anything. Because philosophers who took this skeptical approach in the past were eventually defeated by people who said that more or less you have reason for taking *near absolute* knowledge as true knowledge. At the very least it is near absolute in terms of being structural knowledge about the patterns you relate through.

&gt;You‚Äôre conflating knowledge and action. Do you disagree that they are different? Do you think a ball rolling down the hill has knowledge because it does something?

""knowledge how"" versus ""knowledge that."" You do have to know *how* to do things to do them provided you aren't doing them accidentally. But a view that said that everyone was just doing everything accidentally can be dismissed as obviously getting basic facts about the world wrong."

"Honestly, yeah. The LGBT community is pretty annoyed that Hollywood has decided it can monetize their stories/hardships without any (or barely any) kind of meaningful participation in the legwork. The community itself has been plenty effective at efforts to normalize their presence in the mainstream. It's pretty obnoxious that Hollywood thinks it can waltz in at the last minute to make money off something they've had very little part in without involving members of the community where it counts. Especially after Stonewall ended up being a whitewashed piece of dog shit, the community as a whole would rather tell its stories on its own terms, even if it means a smaller audience."

You can't argue as two things being a problem of equal proportion, as your first message very clearly implied, without any indication of prevalence. This is intellectually disingenuous, which is what people were getting on you about. Whether this was intentional or not, I have no clue, but it is a very dishonest way to make a statement.

I don't understand this. I checked the reference you gave, and it didn't seem to talk about consummation at all. It was more about whether a trans-woman was woman enough to marry a man.

But that got me thinking about civil partnerships and gay marriage. I checked, and it seems that same sex couples are exempt from having to discuss that awkward, sticky business in court. Maybe, when civil partnerships are extended to include heterosexual couples, parliament will also take the opportunity to remove consummation from the definition of marriage entirely. It's just a troublesome anachronism, really."

&gt;""Please stay: I don't want to sleep alone tonight,"" Raymond tried to say, but the words caught in his throat. All he managed to say was ""'Night."" Raymond's eyes fell as his friend turned to leave, and he saw the door swing closed.

It might be worthwhile to experiment with single quotes on the things that go unsaid, or some other warning that the dialogue is only in Raymond's head.

"How much work effort a style takes is going to vary between artists. I know it's not the most helpful advice but I'd say go with what feels most natural as your doing it. It will be harder at first but ultimately I think its what most artists end up with. 

You can also start with making a mood board though. I can't really tell you how to make a mood board since there are no rules, collect a bunch of images as reference, styles that speak to you somehow, and then use it as a guide to making a style you feel comfortable with. It will just take some iterations."

"They're forever stamps. Also, for a 13 oz letter, sent at Media/Library mail rates is $2.66.  That's enough stamps for that. Now, the only things that qualify for Media/Library mail are books without advertising; **16 mm or less films or rolls of film**; printed music; sound or video recordings; play scripts; manuscripts; DVDs; CDs; printed educational charts; testing materials; medical information pages; maps in the form of atlases; and computer-readable disks.

"So far I‚Äôm loving serverless! And VSCode‚Äôs support for azure makes for a great developer experience. I haven‚Äôt figured out the best way to share code though.

As far as auth goes, I actually don‚Äôt have much experience. Two of my projects don‚Äôt have an auth. 

My primary project is complicated.. it is hosted on an azure app service running asp.net core. The Vue index page which loads the SPA is actually an asp.net view served by a controller after you‚Äôve authenticated via Azure Active Directory (essentially oauth). Once you are in the SPA, I use Vue-adal to handle AAD auth for Dynamics 365 (my SPA directly queries Dynamics 365 via its FetchXML web api).

I believe Google and Amazon have their own auth libraries which are used in many Vue tutorials.

For my side projects, I‚Äôll eventually use something like Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, etc.

Por que ele n√£o pode ter uma altera√ß√£o de -6% por causa do efeito Doria?

"&gt;When you talk to people with differing political beliefs do you see them as equals?

Unless they're commies. 

&gt;when you talk to someone over the internet do you speak differently than you would in person?

I'm more argumentative online. 

&gt;Being that questions often go unanswered in follow-ups, why do you choose to end a thread?

I often can't be bothered, if the followups require me to do any actual thinking. Asides, if too many people reply to me, I just ignore all of them. 

&gt;Do you believe NSs and NNs alike talk down to eachother?

"Maybe a few meetings of something like Al-Anon or SMART for Family and Friends for DH? 

FIL has found himself the perfect wife. In Toxy, he has the perpetual victim who will always feed his martyr/saint/white knight complex. However, from the description of his behavior with his own mother, he doesn't actually like following through on these roles. Again, Toxy is perfect for this; her drug habit means she's quietly off in her own little drugged out world when they don't need to feed their shared drama habit. She's almost like a doll he can take out of a cupboard and put away when he's done.

Your DH doesn't have to pull up a chair to the tea party. He doesn't have to enable this shared sick fantasy. SMART and Al-Anon both help people around addicts go ""Okay, I've decided I've had enough of the crazy train world tour. This is my stop."" By going to meetings, he can see that he's not the only one dealing with an addict who has the ""It was a seizure! ... Never mind!"" cycle. He can see that he isn't the only one with a father like his. He can even gain the perspective of people who have been through that and laid down healthy boundaries. He'll get a chance to talk to people who can say ""Yeah, it sucked to do but I'm happier because I did it."" That might be really valuable at this particular point in his journey. "

"USCG issued uniforms are hands down a better quality of material than Army issued OCP or ACU. The issued ODU is thicker than its Army counterpart making it hold an iron and crease better. Everything about the uniform, from rolling the sleeves to blousing the pants, looks slicker and tighter than when done on the thinner Army uniforms. 

The USCG does its distribution through the CG Exchange. I think this helps ensure the quality of the material purchased for the uniforms creation is not down graded for the sake of finances. "

"&gt;I'd love for him to have gotten male influence and role models the easy way, but his mother and our government took that opportunity away from us. Now he'll have to learn the hard way with a condensed course that is an enlistment in the military. 

BULL-FUCKING-SHIT.
=

He's 11... that's nearly the PERFECT age, and **there is still time.**
-
Just don't **waste** it.

-
Not saying that there is anything wrong with taking him out shooting rifles in the desert... **but that is really NOT what he needs.**

-
What he **needs** is some exposure to what jobs/careers men ACTUALLY do...  Ideally things where he can SEE &amp; OBSERVE men actually working: building, repairing, creating, MAKING things.

What things?  Anything &amp; Everything:  Guys working on cars (ripping engines out, tearing apart transmissions, etc), men working on construction crews (carpenters, electricians, plumbers), various men using all kinds of machinery (farm tractors, road construction graders, loaders, etc). And **duh** anything/everything with TRAINS (doesn't have to be YOUR train... *any* train will do for starters).

You need to -- at this age especially -- start EXPOSING him to some of those things...  then ***SEE what of that stuff ""sparks"" his interest;*** *what does he get ""excited"" about seeing (before OR after), what does he ASK to see MORE of... learn more about, talk about, etc.*

From there, you'll need to encourage and ENABLE him to take the NEXT step -- to TRY something like that with his own hands -- work with him on something ASSOCIATED with that (whatever it happens to be: maybe it's some ""wood"" project, maybe it's buying &amp; helping him refurb a mountain bike, then maybe some gas powered mini-bike or go-cart; or an R/C airplane, drone/quadcopter, **whatever** he is EXCITED about -- and *it doesn't MATTER if you don't know diddly squat about it, you can learn TOGETHER* even if its only on the occasional weekend; quit thinking that ""fun ""is only stupid ""entertainment"" shit).

---
EDIT: Oh and also this:

&gt;I joined the Marine Corps when I was 18, and it is probably the single factor that **diverted me off the path of being a bitch.**

It didn't work.
-
You still **ARE** a *whiney little bitch.*

*QUIT IT ALREADY with the fucking ""pity party"" crap.*  Your kid is 11 -- hasn't even hit puberty yet and won't for a couple of years -- yet YOU have already tossed in the towel.

There are 7 years -- **SEVEN YEARS** -- before he hits age 18... that's more years LEFT yet than he has lived since becoming even *artially* ""aware"" of the world -- and moreover, SEVEN **YEARS** when he is finally INTELLIGENT and increasingly CAPABLE of learning *whatever he sets his mind &amp; body to* **AND** *whatever he gets the OPPORTUNITY to try, to be exposed to.

-
If you give up on him... let those **SEVEN YEARS** pass by -- yes even if it is only a weekend here or there -- without doing a damned thing to help him learn...

-
Then you really ARE still a little whinging BITCH.

"It was a long shot when the rumors started and obviously longer now, but Patrick Peterson is definitely the guy in my mind. He‚Äôs an absolute monster of a weapon and I think he singlehandedly would transform our defense to very good. If you‚Äôre worried about getting pressure, Peterson and bumping Gilmore to 2 let you leave both pretty much alone outside and gives you flexibility to send an extra rusher. If you‚Äôre worried about a TE he or Gilmore have the physicality to drop down and man up there. If the receiving core isn‚Äôt a huge issue and a RB is he could step into the box and man up on him and guard the WR like we have been. If you need to stop the run you can leave him/Gilmore on islands outside and stack the box. Plus he‚Äôs way better on the speed of Hill than anyone on our roster.

And nobody waits untill 9th month to perform abortion. It's legal, but nobody does that because the purpose of abortion is not to kill a fetus but to prioritize woman's choice.

"In 1944-45, Frank Sinatra had a radio show called ""The Frank Sinatra Show.""

I found this page because I'm a big fan of Lauritz Melchior, the guest star for this particular show.
I was delighted by the little song in the sample clip, which Sinatra seems not to have recorded or released elsewhere.
Apparently the song ""Here it is Monday"" was from the musical comedy ""Song of the Open Road"", which wikipedia
lists as being released in June 1944.

Interestingly, this episode of the Frank Sinatra show is listed as being broadcast on March 29th, 1944. The song 
must have been floating around somewhere for a few months before the movie came out.  Perhaps they spruik the movie
at the end of Sinatra's performance?"

"Most of my builds end up becoming faith builds. The basis of faith builds depends upon what you want to do with it. Are you going relatively pure faith as a lightning throwing caster? Are you making a regeneration build with a lot of passive healing? Are you setting yourself up with an infused weapon and vow of silence to counter casters? Or are you trying to make a fast hitting buff build to take advantage of the highest damaging buff in the game, the coveted Dark Moon Blade. This choice will really impact how your build is constructed statwise, as well as the maximum soul level you want to reach and any rings that you prefer, like the hornet for example.


Is it worth it to invest in intelligence? Short answer is no. Faith is normally a split between melee and casting since faith spells are more utility than damaging on average, so your stats are spread thin. Adding intelligence to the mix will just reduce your effectiveness overall, and is only worthwhile if you want to be a pyromancer or pure PvE player.


In terms of Catalyst, it really depends on the weapon art and current faith stat you have. For the early game I use cleric‚Äôs Sacred chime until I have over 30 or so, but most of my builds end up sitting at 60 faith with Yorshka‚Äôs Chime which is indisputably the best for pure magic adjustment when buffing weapons.


When choosing your weapon, your playstyle really matters. How do you feel about buffs like lightning blade? If you don‚Äôt mind being constrained to a 30 or so second window of immense damage per cast, then these buffs will outdo all your other tools. The additional damage from dark/dark moon/lightning blade is all a flat number that scales with your talisman‚Äôs magic adjust (which scales with faith and upgrades) and is added to each swing you make. Since the number does not increase or decrease depending on what weapon you choose, you want a weapon that can hit as fast as possible to stack the damage as quickly as you can. Dex-based weapons will be much stronger than faith weapons for this, especially any of the twin weapons. I made a build around darkmoon blade and the sellsword twin blades that could melt opponents with a single combo attack, but sometimes a weapon with more range like a straight sword or estoc can help you get damage in safely.


Weapons with innate damage split, like the Dragonslayer‚Äôs Axe‚Äôs lightning damage or the Mad King‚Äôs Crucifix‚Äôs dark damage will be a determining factor in which of these buffs you apply. As with any other aspect of the game, the fewer defenses you split your damage between, the better. Some infusions can also add stat scaling to the existing split damage, like the lightning infusion on the Dragonslayer‚Äôs Axe I mentioned earlier.


If you don‚Äôt like the buff window or want to focus on direct damage casts like lightning stake and great lightning spear, then you‚Äôre better off with a lightning infused weapon and possibly a talisman with more poise, like the canvas talisman. The lothric weapons are very good for infusions with an impressive S scaling on the straight-sword. The Lothric Knight Greatsword is an exception, because it is the only weapon where the blessed infusion (reduced damage but added health regen) actually increases the AR more than the lightning infusion. If you like strength builds, then a blessed Lothric Knight Greatsword is definitely what I would recommend.


(The reason I said great lightning spear instead of sunlight spear earlier, is that it starts with the same animation color as lightning stake, which can be used to trick opponents into thinking you will use a ranged attack only to slam down the wrath of the sky onto unsuspecting phantoms.)


If you want to take advantage of the low faith requirement for some of the more useful utility miracles, making your build physically focused with a refined/sharp/heavy weapon will produce better results. If you go full faith early, a raw weapon will be the best bet for buffing before you have good stats.

TLDR;

Don‚Äôt spec into intelligence, if high faith use Yorshka‚Äôs Chime, Lothric weapons, sunlight straight sword, Dragonslayer weapons, Mad King‚Äôs Crucifix, any dex/twin weapon if you plan on buffing."

Before this gets deleted by reddit admins, this asshole took it completely out of context. First of all, the idiot thinks it was a marionette deck. It wasn't. That card's not even in the deck. He was running counterspell draw, this was approximately turn 25, every single creature and spell I cast was countered or removed up until that point and this dumbass who copied his deck from MTG Salvation or Goldfish used one of his last copies of negate to counter a Revel in Riches when he had 0 creatures on the field and I had 0 treasures in play, thus the ""this spell does literally nothing"" and he should have let it resolve. I love it when people copy a deck and have no idea how to run it or play MTG. I was just throwing it out because I had 5 mana and it was the only card left in my hand and the game was already over anyway. So on the way out I let him know what an idiot he was for countering a spell that does nothing in the current board state.

NOBODY wants to watch a recording of a game where I cast something and he counters it or removes it x30 turns. That's idiotic. I should have left the game the second I saw what he was running. This was the 5th attempt at getting a recording of something resembling watchable MTG gameplay and 5 people in a row were playing Karn draw control loop or free cast torrential graveyard resurrection control or approach control loop. So yeah, I was pissed and he was an asshole for playing this. He's one of those idiots who doesn't care about the other players one bit, it's all about winning. So running 35 control spells seems reasonable because NOTHING matters but winning. Thanks for not showing the board state with library counts or the full log, asshole. Enjoy your temporary ban from reddit."

For sideboard, I highly recommend \[\[Silent Gravestone\]\] to help with BG and now the self-mill Izzet Phoenix decks, and personally I think \[\[Detection Tower\]\] is a must for Esper Control and Nullhide/Carnage. For RDW/Aggro, I like \[\[Fountain of Renewal\]\]. I've found \[\[Thief of Sanity\]\] to be pretty helpful too, it's mad fun to steal landbound BG's Carnage or plainswalkers. One of my favorite games ever was against some Jeskai Control nerd where I ended up with a flipped Bolas, Angrath, and one of their Teferis.

Also, I've been maindecking Syncopate since there's so much graveyard shenanigans with BG and Phoenix decks.

"Anti-intellectualism is incredible too. 

I grew up with dial up Internet, and when I was young I honestly thought that we were entering a new paradigm in which everyone would be educated and knowledgeable because of such incredible access to information. But of course the idiots started spreading misinformation, and tons of porn, and the internet became a big, stupid social experiment that has mostly just revealed the depths of human depravity.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Edit: I just realized why people are taking issue with my use of porn as an example of what's wrong with the internet. To be clear, I don't think that the spread of porn is necessarily bad or simply due to idiots; I just think it's indicative of how incredibly naive I was as a kid. (My first experience with dial up Internet was around 12-13 years old.)

I myself look at porn, and I don't think of myself as an idiot, so my most personal apologies to anyone who might've thought I was calling them an idiot for liking, watching, or spreading porn. That was just poor wording on my part."

"Banks won't give out that information on any customers.

Kemp could give some detail, unless there is something in the business' structure that disallows people from publicizing their finances.

Based on the replies here, releasing some of the terms of the loan wouldn't help really. Most people don't know how this works.

If you have a background in it, you can take a pretty good guess at what was going on and why things were structured the way they are described. It isn't interesting or odd. That is likely why regulators who have been reviewing it for years haven't done anything.

God of War had a great story.  But it was an impossible game to exist.  Games are never that perfect, it's just unheard of.  That fact that something like that happened is unthinkable, and I think that it could change the industry because it proves that its possible.

Spider-Man wasn't revolutionary - it was just a fun game.


And the fuck was so good about Horizon?  I enjoyed it, but not once did I see something that hadn't been done before, or that was so mind blowingly impressive that it blew me away.

It's all opinion, of course.  But to me, there was literally nothing wrong with God of War.  That doesnt mean it's the greatest game of all time.  That doesnt mean that it has the greatest story ever.  But so much came together to make it **special**.  And that's the key thing here."

The reason why I can't afford to lose it is because it will strike my confidence harder than ever before. I'm 18 and never dated, never held a girls hand, but I'm not horrible looking.

"DMG is the least important book and probably the worst. It has a list of all magic items and rarities which can make it important, but following the ""it's your game"" idea, it doesn't matter, especially if you are gonna homebrew your magic items. It has some things for building campaigns and rivals but it really isn't necessary.  


Xanathar's and Volo's are expansions, Xanathar's being the best for the extra archetypes and offers a lot of DM tools, whereas Volo's offers extra races, monsters and a guide to some monsters for roleplay and monster culture."

You can appear more like the opposite sex through taking hormones and having a fake penis or vagina, but it is not the real deal.

"I'll type and emphasize words how I wish. Your lesson is to not take it so personally. It bespeaks an unraveling towards ad hominem as your argument quickly looses its feet. I'm not the only one poking holes in your weak and naive stance, so I understand your faltering. You never had strong ground to stand on to begin with. But be sophisticated about it at least.

Looking to how Mercury RX has become its own entity in popular culture--it is true that we would have BEEN heard about Venus and her retrogrades, with the collective hive mind at least being remotely aware of what it could portend. One needn't be in Astrological communities to understand or hear about things that originate here.

Certainly people are affected by things they are ignorant about. In this case, Venus RX. My assertion is that its effects aren't 100% negative and fatalistic in nature--so much so that I'd dare get on some soapbox and interrupt people's lives and weddings and relationships with my arrogance (re: you. You're not a fortune teller) and with lopsided interpretations.  Some Venus RX effects are positive, neutral or benign. That is ALL of Astrology. Speaking of--I LOVE how you disregarded my attempt to make this about actual Astrology and unique charts of people and how Venus RX is different for everyone, therefore no one person can prescribe ONE way of doing things--it shows a lack of skill and savvy.

Also my point stands--if everyone all at once were, for instance, breaking up during Venus RX, again, since time immemorial--word of mouth and anecdotal generational evidence would have rendered it a phenomena by now. Wanna know how I know? Because for ages people have talked about the effects of the Full Moon--and now THAT is a phenomena. Same logic applies. Mercury RX is also quickly following suit.

I'm not doing a poll, I was being facetious. My stance is that Venus RX produces a myriad of results. Yours is that it produces ONE type of result--bad ones. Statistically, I know I'm correct.

I always come back to a passage from Astrologer Steven Forrest, who writes about all the positive potentials of transits and movements that garden variety Astrologers would nay say--about Mr. Rogers starting his SUCCESSFUL show during harsh transits and a Mercury RX:

&gt;""The message? If you hear a teaching about a transit or natal aspect that feels overtly negative or personally limiting, question it. It all comes back to your experience. If you‚Äôre feeling boxed in by an interpretation, how can you reframe it so that you feel more empowered?  
&gt;  
&gt;This isn‚Äôt to say the the shadow experience of life isn‚Äôt real, or should be discounted. It‚Äôs just that any transit, even a Mars square Neptune transit or a Pluto opposite Venus transit, can express in shadow AND/OR light. And too often we describe the shadow potential and forget there is potential for light too.""

&amp;#x200B;"

"""it‚Äôs a stress test and bug fixer. "" That is what a BETA is meant to be, fine tuning the final product using a broader audience, this is after they do Internal testing during the ALPHA.

"With that income and low amount of debt I think something like lending tree can help. A while back I opted for a 3 year payback on about $12k in CC debt and got a 6% interest rate. Locked in the payment and it allowed me to start from scratch with a defined amount. Instead of paying $300 a month in interest, I have a loan with a few months leftover. The trick is, not running those cards up again, if you do you‚Äôre screwed. 

Also, car payments are truly a waste, chasing good money after bad with your insurance. Ditch the wheels if you can and get something cheap, or start riding your bike if possible. I will never again borrow money for a vehicle, let go of the foolish pride and drive a heap of shit. I went from a $42k pickup to a Suzuki SX4, I still laugh at myself when I see dudes in pickups.... knowing their take home is at least $1k lower than mine automatically by driving that hunk of scrap. That extra thousand has dropped years off of my retirement goal and given me so much leverage to have nice things.

"Pitchfork's review of them was pretty garbage. It seems pretty dumb to hate them for sounding like another band, you would have to hate a lot of people for not having original sounds, which would make music unlistenable. This is their first album, give them some time to develop artistically. If you like listening to them, that's great! They have some jams! Nobody forces you to listen to anything. If they sounded generic or boring, you wouldn't listen or enjoy them. 

Pitchfork's review hardly even touched on the music. It was all about image, but that's not why I listen to music. I am excited to see where their careers take them. I hope they steer away from what makes Led Zeppelin so Led Zeppelin, but if they use those influences to make something great, I don't see a reason to hate them. And if they just end up being a Led Zeppelin cover band, that's fine too. If it's good to listen to, I won't have a problem with it.

"Science does a good job of explaining our world, but science has a lot of uncertainty. I attended a lecture my a MIT engineering professor on this topic. Any physicist and chemist would tell you that it is impossible to tell you the momentum and location of an electron at the same time. A physicist would tell you that math completely breaks down within a black hole and becomes a singularity. A psychologist would tell you our brain constructs our experience from a patchwork of sensory inputs, and although does it extremely well, the human mind is prone to making misjudgments and mistakes, ie patternicity. I forget what the professor specifically talked about in his lecture, it was something about the uncertainty of the particles involved in nuclear radiation. The inexplicable is prevalent and, even in some cases, forms the backbone of science. "

At this point I‚Äôve only found two that can meet the need.

One is the Royal Kludge G87. The other is the Devro Calibur 71.

The RK has the function row keys (not really important) and a supposedly much longer rated battery life. The Devro looks better built but has a terrible battery life by all reports.

I‚Äôve got the RK R61 60% at the office, though usually only drive the iPad and phone. (I use a Razer with green switches for the docked Surface.). It‚Äôs a great keyboard, but I‚Äôd rather not have to deal with the quirks of the 60% format for a full workday.

Has anyone had experience with either of these? I‚Äôm especially interested in knowing about the RK G87 because of my good experience with the R61.

"I think online definitely has it's place in certain fields. Taking two years off carries a huge opportunity cost and is not do-able for a lot of people with kids and those further in their careers.

Preface: I'm speaking only of the logistics field. I'm sure FT blows online out of the water for banking/Consulting.

I actually asked the question of full-time vs online MBA to the director of the JBLM Camo2Commerce today. He recommended that instead of leaving the workforce for two years, do the corporate fellowship and do an online MBA. The fellowship alone will likely lead you into a mid-level management position and an MBA will additional doors into director level positions. Speaking of ASU alone, their post-graduation MBAs in SCM were making $95k average, which sounds like mid-level management to me.  So, it seems like the 2 years off for FT MBA in SCM would be a waste for those of us coming out of the Army and going into mid-level management."

"&gt;minerals aren‚Äôt the bottleneck, gas is.

I don't know how you've reached that conclusion? The Robo/immortal/prism are all very mineral heavy at a time in the game when you're still building infastructure which is extremely mineral heavy.

Consider that **by the time you have brought the robo online it costs Gate 150/0 + Cybercore 150/0 + Robo 200/100 = 500/100**

Ontop of this you're **chronoboosting probes, and adding pylons which at 50 and 100 minerals a pop** add up quickly.

Do you add another gate? Are you unsure where the terrans buildings are and need a shield battery?

All mineral.

Then you get to producing from it, immortal 250/100 + immortal 250/100 + pylon 100/0 (since 2 immortals are 8 supply) **now you've spent 1100 minerals just on the path to getting 2 immortals** and including the mineral cost of macro and infastructure you can see why you'd be mineral constrained in this scenario.

Stargate is the gas heavy route.

"Americans dont want those jobs because the pay is too low for the working conditions but people who break the law to come here (and sustain it with continued ID theft) will take any port in a storm. that's why farmers have no incentive to mechanized or innovate, why do that when theres an endless supply of cheap labor who will suffer almost any violation as long as ICE isnt called?"

"This is going to be incredibly lengthy, but I do hope you take the time to read it. Please know that I'm not trying to be snarky or condescending in saying that. I'm sincerely trying to emphasize that I think it's important to understanding people's worries and the parallels. While reading, please consider how a liberal might view this in the context of: the family separations, the Muslim Bans, the attacks on LGBT communities, the constant little and big lies, the capitulating to other strongmen, the attacks on allies, etc.

&gt;""**To live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it‚Äîplease try to believe me‚Äîunless one has a much greater degree of political awareness, acuity, than most of us had ever had occasion to develop. Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained or, on occasion, ‚Äòregretted,‚Äô that, unless one were detached from the whole process from the beginning, unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle, what all these ‚Äòlittle measures‚Äô that no ‚Äòpatriotic German‚Äô could resent must some day lead to**, one no more saw it developing from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. One day it is over his head.

&gt;How is this to be avoided, among ordinary men, even highly educated ordinary men? Frankly, I do not know. I do not see, even now. Many, many times since it all happened I have pondered that pair of great maxims, Principiis obsta and Finem respice‚Äî‚ÄòResist the beginnings‚Äô and ‚ÄòConsider the end.‚Äô But one must foresee the end in order to resist, or even see, the beginnings. One must foresee the end clearly and certainly and how is this to be done, by ordinary men or even by extraordinary men? Things might have. And everyone counts on that might.

&gt;""Your ‚Äòlittle men,‚Äô your Nazi friends, were not against National Socialism in principle. Men like me, who were, are the greater offenders, not because we knew better (that would be too much to say) but because we sensed better. Pastor Niem√∂ller spoke for the thousands and thousands of men like me when he spoke (too modestly of himself) and said that, when the Nazis attacked the Communists, he was a little uneasy, but, after all, he was not a Communist, and so he did nothing; and then they attacked the Socialists, and he was a little uneasier, but, still, he was not a Socialist, and he did nothing; and then the schools, the press, the Jews, and so on, and he was always uneasier, but still he did nothing. And then they attacked the Church, and he was a Churchman, and he did something‚Äîbut then it was too late.""

&gt; ""Yes,"" I said.

&gt;""You see,"" my colleague went on, ""one doesn‚Äôt see exactly where or how to move. **Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow.** You don‚Äôt want to act, or even talk, alone; you don‚Äôt want to ‚Äògo out of your way to make trouble.‚Äô Why not?‚ÄîWell, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.

&gt;""Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows.** Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‚Äòeveryone‚Äô is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none.** You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not so bad‚Äô or ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre seeing things‚Äô or ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre an alarmist.‚Äô

&gt;""And you are an alarmist. **You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can‚Äôt prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don‚Äôt know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end?** On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.

&gt;""**But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That‚Äôs the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked‚Äîif, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ‚Äô43 had come immediately after the ‚ÄòGerman Firm‚Äô stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ‚Äô33. But of course this isn‚Äôt the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next.** Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D...

&gt;""And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‚ÄòJewish swine,‚Äô collapses it all at once, and **you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in‚Äîyour nation, your people‚Äîis not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves;** when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.

E: In case it wasn't obvious to any readers, this is from the aforementioned book [They Thought They Were Free](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.html)

E2: I made some clarifications in the opening paragraph to hopefully make it slightly more in relation to the original questions OP asked. Not trying to dodge them.

E3: Added some emphasis to make reading slightly easier if people are in a rush."

"I don't think that was the last mass shooting, last year a man in Western Australia shot I think 5 or 6 of his family members. They still do happen. However it was the last shooting on that scale, and the frequency of shootings and gun use in any crime has decreased. I don't know how long Australia had mass shootings, but throughout the 80s/90s leading up to Port Arthur I have heard it was about once a year. The timeline from 'Port Arthur Massacre happens' to 'new gun laws in place, illegal firearms bought back' was probably a couple years, knowing how long legislation would have taken to pass etc. and sorting out all the details.


Another issue I meant to mention in my first post is that the US has a very strong culture of defending yourself and your property with deadly force, which is not reflected at all in Australia. Firearms are for pest control and hunting, NOT self defence. Shooting a burglar in your home with a legally owned firearm is likely still going to considered murder, unless said burglar was actively trying to kill/seriously hurt you. I'm not sure shooting a home invader dead was ever really legal in Australia, and if/when this would have changed, however I do see this as a big challenge for the US to overcome. The whole 'register your firearm for hunting or sport' thing doesn't make sense when many gun owners have a gun to 'protect themselves'."

"My only advice is do most or all of the work they give you during the mods. That was my approach and I did pretty well. Research stuff you don't know, read solutions thoroughly and pick up all the stuff you missed. Go through PCs and technical stuff you aren't comfortable with leading up to the exams. If you did all 8 weeks of work the mod exams should be a gimme for the most part, they have high pass rates. For core 1/2 specifically, redo all the MCQs leading up to the exam, assuming they're still about 3/4 MCQ. 

Supplemental stuff like Densmore is okay, but not really necessary for mods (more useful for CFE). "

&gt; Its kind of a genius revenge tactic, but the ones who suffered the most are my new renters.  One guy has a thyroid problem and had to repurchase $500 in meds.  A lot of people missed paychecks or credit cards.  One lady missed the receipt of a Death Certificate.  We thought someone was stealing the mail from the mailbox at first but then we started watching the mailman just skip over the house everyday and some ""test"" mail didn't move.  So I tried calling the USPS and that got me nowhere.  Going down in person was the only way to do this I guess.  Turns out, some lady who we'd kicked out for being nasty, attracting bugs, and breaking furniture was mad or something or maybe using my address like a personal PO Box?  Who knows.  The post office was really nice about it though and gave me back all my mail.  Still, how could this have happened?  Surely this can't be legal.  I got copies of her hold requests too as proof it was her.  She hadn't lived there in 2 weeks when she put in the first one.

The storylet says the 'Palace Guard is Watchful, Dangerous and Shadowy', so clearly one of those statements is wrong.

I'll probably send an email to FBG about it later.

EDIT: Just noticed another stats discrepancy for the Protective Mandrake - storylet description was Watchful and Shadowy, actual companion stats Dangerous+4, Shadowy+2, Dreaded +1. Not sure which is the correct one. I sent an email about both to FBG."

"Fist day of my engineering graphics class. The best way to describe her was the ‚Äúvalley girl‚Äù type. And since she was the only girl in my class I sat down next to her. I‚Äôm a 20F. The whole 3 hours she was on her phone, texting rapidly. When we‚Äôre getting ready to leave we have a conversation like this: 
Her: ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm on my way to my ex boyfriends house and beg him back‚Äù 

Me: Why are you begging for him back?

‚ÄúI made the worst mistake of my life and broke up with him and feel really bad. He‚Äôs such a good person‚Äù 

Why did y‚Äôall break up? 

‚ÄúWe used to be long distance and he moved from Florida (which is about 15 hours away from us) and started the nursing program at (college we go to) and moved in with me. I broke up with him because I wanted to be single but now he‚Äôs stuck here. What should I do??‚Äù

"That was amazing, great job! I loved it.

But being a SW nerd, I have to criticize two things in particular:

The thermal detonator. I hate when it gets used (in games frequently) as a basic grenade when the original films (and many EU sources afterwards) depicted it more like a bomb. The way everyone got skittish in Jaba's Palace made it seem like the whole place was coming down if the thermal detonator went off.

The ""distinct"" Stormtroopers. I know it's something the new trilogy did with the weird single Chrome Trooper, but that rubs me the wrong way, too. Seeing a couple ""stylish"" Troopers next to all the factory-new ones just made things weird to me."

"I'm sorry to hear.. I just recently went through a similar scenario.. Unfortunately she had horrible seperation anxiety, to the point where it was crippling both of us. That was the first time I had to give back an adopted dog.. It was incredibly difficult.

Perhaps your guy needs another doggo, perhaps he needs an experience owner, or perhaps he just needs time to settle.

My suggestion would to be let your organization know what's going on. They can give you advice, and it's best to let them know what's going on so they can give fosters a heads up that they may be getting the dog back.

I know it hurts. I was devastated when I had to give back a dog. I mean, we rescue these animals because we care and want to give them a good home, it really hurts to admit to yourself that you aren't the right home. It takes a lot of courage.. It really does. A shitty person wouldn't do/say anything, or even care.

Please go easy on yourself. Just let the organization know what's going on and try not to stress it. This is why organizations have trial periods. 

If he ends up having to go back to the group, just know he will find a home and he will be happy. I personally think it sounds like something an experienced owner should be dealing with. That is not your fault.. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

"+1, healing with VE and a Renew is great. I remember some groups were good enough I would just hop into Shadowform for certain pulls - at least for the first mob to burst it down, then hop out for a Renew if needed. Back then I had a Troll Priest and the racial is a kind of Shadowguard, so it was even more useful to level as Shadow. Seems that is the case with Undead as well due to their racial.

I did enjoy leveling one of my Priests as Disc/Holy though, as a change, but that said - there's something really special feeling about Shadow. And then if you ever respec to healing you'll really appreciate the added healing benefits you had to do without during leveling."

"You‚Äôre right. There is a small connectivity server that needs to run. The chrome extension on the devices is pointed to this server and so is the console used for monitoring. 

I may be misunderstanding what you mean when you say targeting users. The software is licensed by how many devices can be connected simultaneously but the extension is deployed/enforced by user OU in the GSuite Admin console. Is that the user targeting you‚Äôre referring to? Even in this scenario, I have the extension deployed to the entire student body, but not nearly that many licenses for simultaneous connection. When it comes to chrome I think this is pretty much to only way to do it. Extensions run at the time of user login, but are not installed, per se, on the machine like I would install the agent on a Mac or Windows box. As a side effect of this, there is no unattended remote access possible for a chrome book with this software. If a user isn‚Äôt logged in with a browser window open I can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs going on."

"As far as I know Spotify hired the Snowy dev quite a while before watchOS4 came out. Considering the dev himself said that Spotify told him they were going to release his work as an official Spotify app, and that was over a year ago, what do you call it?

Sure it's possible his work will live on in some future watchOS 5 version, and if so they should tell us that the limitations of watchOS 4 are holding them back. But it wasn't the case when they hired him.

Amongst the Spotify users I know and music communities I participate in there is a perception that Spotify has not been releasing new features consistently and if anything removes more features than they add. Then they came out with this awful UI update that barely changes anything and just makes the search page look clunky. Spotify needs to put more effort into communicating with and providing features for paying users."

This tactic may be considered socially worth it for the tribal right winger even if they believe the chances it‚Äôs a false flag are slim. On the tiny chance that it actually is a false flag they would get a social reward for being right among their tribe and a data point to sling at opponents. They would love to use it to justify every future hateful conspiracy and to justify pinning every bad thing that happens in the world on their opponents. If it‚Äôs proven false they just dismiss the proof as more conspiracy or say nothing. Either way they lose very little - their credibility within their echo chamber won‚Äôt take much of a hit due to being part of the tribe which is more important and their credibility to outsiders was already essentially zero. Low risk high reward.

America needs a full blown overhaul of our election system that does away with gerrymandering, clears up any doubt about voting eligibility, automatically registers every voting age adult, and adds a holiday for everyone outside of those administering the electoral process. If America can‚Äôt solve a simple and critical problem like this, then we have truly become an incompetent, foolish, and lazy country. How the fuck did we manage something like the interstate highway system, the Panama Canal, our roles in the World Wars, the moon landing... I mean come the fuck on. This is not acceptable. "

"The Chibika's ""DELETE"" ability has the capability to eradicate a Chibi from existence. This is the only known way to 'kill' a Chibi. From this we've been able to determine that Console Abilities that are inherent to the Primary Monika and all variants to include Chibika's can affect Chibis.

Otherwise at most we've seen Chibis suffer bruising and bleeding scratches but nothing more serious then that. They're otherwise impervious to harm.

I left that job and joined the Military. 18hrs before I left for boot camp I got a call that I won a 50"" Plasma LG TV. I gave the information to my parents and left. Around 5 weeks later my parents got the TV. My family used it while I was in the Military, and once I left I got it.

"I worked for 6 months as a contractor for a company that specialized in pilot plants and process design.

I just recently finished up that rotational program and received my permanent assignment.

Anywho, that was just my explanation on why I feel qualified to answer this...

My personal take is that a rotational program will give you a very good understanding of what you want to do with your career without making any lasting commitments. Additionally, if you choose to stay in that company, you‚Äôll be a huge asset with a versatile skillset. These rotational programs aren‚Äôt just out of the kindness of the company‚Äôs heart; they know that in the future they‚Äôll get dividends from investing in you now.

That being said, if you know for a fact that you like the design/consulting work, don‚Äôt hesitate to start there. I don‚Äôt foresee that type of experience disqualifying you from other opportunities down the road."

"Absolutely! It‚Äôs been long, but fairly painless if you can handle paperwork! I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs different for each agency/state, but here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done. 
Step 1: Fill out initial paperwork (~30 pages). Questions range from what is your birthday to how is your sex life, to what was your relationship to your parents growing up. If you aren‚Äôt ok with talking about everything in your past, fostering is not for you. Don‚Äôt worry if there are questionable things in your past, they just want to know you‚Äôve dealt with it. 
Step 2: attend an orientation, 3-4 hrs long. 
Step 3: watch videos about foster care rights, signs of abuse, safety issues, etc. summarize and submit at least one paragraph per video. 
Step 4: Home inspection: I bought a lock box for any medicine (even tums need to be locked up), tested my smoke alarms, and bought a fire extinguisher. Passed right away. 
Step 5: More paperwork, this time to prove things like home and auto insurance, budget (they don‚Äôt care how much you make, just that you have more coming in than going out, you don‚Äôt get paid to be a foster parent), cpr certifications, pet vaccinations, Fingerprinting, etc. this was a long step just because it took time to collect everything and get it scanned. 
Step 6: Home study! This is the last thing we have to do. My assigned social worker will come out three different times and interview us. Again, expecting very personal questions. They basically are going to write your biography, so want many details of your life. 

I‚Äôm sure there is more, but honestly I think I could have done it all in less than 6 months if I wanted too. It may seem like a lot, but they are placing someone‚Äôs child with you, and considering awful people still make it through the process at times, I just don‚Äôt mind them taking steps to insure the safety of these kids.

Of course there are no liens or accidents involving the car because the car does not exist. The engine does not run very good, because there is no car, so there is no engine.

You have no child of any age and none that died, so I now place a Voodoo Curse on you for lying to me.  

You don't travel with your job because you have no job, because you are a loser. God won't bless you, he will destroy you, when you meet your death.

"&gt; Yeah. Disregard the part where I say I'm liberal

Because I don't care about meaningless labels such as ""liberal"". The connotative definition of liberal has changed so much in the last 2 centuries -- let alone last two decades, that it has no meaningful use. You also seem to have pressumed that your political worldview is correct by pressumption, which is just baseless in itself. 

&gt;which is about protecting individual from precisely the people like you, 

What about protecting the individual tax payer? 

&gt;I bet all the police to protect your ass and force the sterilization is 75th percentile and up. You're view of the world is so basic you wouldn't make the cut yourself.

Lmao, getting very emotional I can sense. Even if this was true (which it's not), it's completely irrelevant for multiple, various reasons. 

1. The people who would get sterilized under my proposition are literally the ones who benefit the most from said proposition by protecting them from themselves. Children are the number one cause of poverty.

2. I'm a MGTOW and an anti-natalist. I think reproduction is immoral and unethical, let alone irrational. Being sterilized for free is giving me a free vasectomy in my eyes. 

3. There are very practical reasons for this proposition. For example, when automation becomes streamlined within the next 15-20 years, it will lead to mass unemployment and societal unrest. A tried,tested, and FAILED solution a modern ""liberal"" would suggest is UBI and communism. An actual solution would be limiting the population -- especially of those who serve no utilitarian or functional purpose to society. 

4. I could very realistically see modern liberals start pushing for reproductive limitations on families, citing things like climate change or even automation (stated above) as the rationale for it.

5. Even if we didn't physically sterilize individuals, we could impose a one-child policy on those who are not deemed feasible, or we could even impose the modern liberals' favorite tool: taxes! 

&gt;Incentivizing? How? Fuck 20 guys and get a free abortion? People don't exactly want to take contraception because gobbling pills is fun for the whole family.

Tragedy of the commons. There's also the fact that a ""liberal"" like you probably also thinks single-mothers and other degenerate parasites are entitled to the government benefits they receive. 

tl;dr: I don't give a shit about meaningless labels; I care about results. In coming time, people who are objective, rational, and callous will see that I am right.

A lot of businesses in general don't want menus online because they want customers to come in and actually see the product. And/or they don't want people to see that their prices are a bit higher. But if quality is better then it's worth it. Unfortunately a lot of people are price based only or go for whatever the highest THC percentage is, which isn't always the best.

Ultimately it's probably better to put the prices online. If only to avoid vague questions and people expecting you to tell them the entire store's contents. But people still call us up and do that anyway.

"Alright, so you agree your original point was poor.

""Proven false"" is entirely inaccurate. Very few allegations are ""proven false.""

However, statistically, somewhere between 2-8% of all allegations that make it criminal reporting are considered ""false;"" that classification includes any report that is later not followed by the victim to a jury trial for any reason, which puts the statistic closer to 2% or less.

Also, 2/3 of assaults are not reported to police, which means that that statistic is 1/3 of all assaults.

People downplay false accusations because they're statistically, demonstrably, historically uncommon.

Your pisspoor analogy doesn't make a difference in that."

"&gt; I really think shared folders are better suited for this than rsync

Apples and oranges. Sharing a directory among machines can't be compared to making a full backup image (what rsync does). New topic - to be honest I don't know how sshfs compares to the other remote mounting schemes. It might be slower. I was earlier comparing directory tree duplication/syncing between NFS and SSH, so a different basis for comparison.

My primary role for these network protocols is backup and filesystem duplication, not just sharing. In this high-traffic local-network role, I noticed a prompt speedup when I switched from NFS to SSH. This might be a local effect with no real relevance. It's certainly not science."

"If we break down their comment it gets really weird.  


Statement: ""On any given day....""  
Meaning: On a day(s) they decide to choose

Statement: ""..the game might be up...""  
Meaning: They may or may not turn the servers on.

Statement: ""...for anywhere between four to eight hours.""  
Meaning: On the off chance their 'given day' coincides with the servers actually being on, the servers themselves will be online for between 4 and 8 hours.

  
So, Bethesday will pick a day of their choosing, and they will also pick whether the servers are up.  Whether those two things occur at the same time is a mystery.  But if some off-hand chance those things occur at the same time then the servers will be up for 4 to 8 hours.    


Bethesda chose a very poor way of communicating and should have immediately clarified their statement...or maybe followed up at least with in a few hours, let alone a day or two...but still even today they haven't officially clarified that original statement.  So, at this point, who's to believe anything they say about a beta schedule going forward?  "

"Thanks for clarifying your question. It's been years since I've read 50S and I only remember the vaguest details, so I'm not sure I'll be able to give you a substantive response. But with regard to your characterization:

&gt;  ""rich mysterious employer does bondage with employee who is unsure""  

I don't think the guy in 50S is the girl's employer--I thought she was a college student. He doesn't control her livelihood. So Thomas's power to fire Cherry adds another layer of conflict. Also, this is a pet peeve of mine, but you're conflating bondage with sadomasochism. Thomas is a masochist; Cherry is a sadist. Which leads to another key difference: the wealthy, powerful, successful man is the one who likes to bottom. The power dynamic between Thomas and Cherry is interesting because she's first his employee, and then he's paying her. He's ""in control"" externally. Also, not sure where you got that Thomas is mysterious (he's not) or that Cherry is unsure (she's not). 

There are other differences which aren't highlighted in the query, just to give you some more context. A key one is that in 50S, if I recall, the guy is highly experienced and the girl is not. Here, neither of them have ever experienced kink/BDSM before, so they're discovering it together, which adds to the emotional bond between them. Also, I'm getting away from the trope/stereotype where people into BDSM have tragic backstories or traumatic childhoods (pretty sure I recall being miffed at that in 50S--another pet peeve of mine!). They're into it because they like it; not because they're broken or one of them has to heal/save the other. 

Hope that helped! I appreciate you taking the time to read my query.

"""winning career record"" is a team stat not a QB stat.

""fights like hell"" Rudy tried really hard also, doesn't he mean he was a good player.

Production out of him is on average less than 200 yards a game.  In today's NFL that is absolutely horrible.  This is an era of offense where more and more QBs are breaking 300 yards per game on a regular basis.  Dak can barely break 200 on good days.  That is absolutely pathetic."

""A theist"" would watch the Sun move across the sky and imagine the Sun was being pulled by a chariot driven by a god also.

Point being that theists aren't very good at describing reality accurately especially when they assert gods are an explanation for a particular phenomena.

"We remember disco and hair metal, though. And some eras just genuinely have more songs that are truly classic. The Vietnam War produced a simply staggering number of absolutely essential songs, for example.

I don't think music is an even progression; sometimes the most commercially viable music just kinda sucks for a while. That's not to say:

* That all current music sucks,
* That older is always better,
* That there is no good music to be found,
* Or that we even KNOW what kind of era we're in! Maybe SoundCloud rap will be iconic in 50 years; maybe it'll be regarded as the same kind of musical misstep as disco or hair metal.

I know this might be unpopular, but it's just my two cents."

"\&gt;  I'm not intending to be rude, but do you get bored a lot?

I suppose so. But I'm not sure it's for the reasons you're thinking. You make it sound like I don't think of things. I do. There's just no sensory component to my thoughts. One interesting thing is that I don't take pictures of things. LIke I don't get anything out of reviewing pictures of places I've been or people I've seen. It always pales in comparison to actually being there. So in that respect I suppose you could say I'm more ""in the moment."" If I'm not receiving immediate input or engaging is doing something, I'm under-stimulated and bored. I get ideas for things but just thinking about it is not enough. I have to go and create it. I'm not entertained by thoughts alone. Like I'm sitting here thinking of things to do after work. I have projects going on that need work. If I don't do them I'll be bored. But I'm also feeling unmotivated.

\&gt;  Are you a calm person in general?

That is a tough question for me to answer. I suppose normally I am but I have my outbursts. People are typically surprised by them. I have a dry, deadpan sense of humor.

\&gt; Do you have a very dry, plain voice in your head?

I have no ""voice"" in my head. I can think of words, but there's no sensory component. I just have an intuitive idea of what the words WOULD sound like without hearing anything in my head.

\&gt; Can you enjoy one piece of art more than the next piece or would all paintings, cartoons or album covers fall into the same category?

"&gt;In that case, I suppose Christianity is a foreign religion as well. It originated in the same place as Islam and Judaism.

Yes, 2000 years ago and spread across European and then was brought here 400 years ago. It was foreign to these lands nearly half a millenium ago. This country was founded on Christian beliefs.

&gt;Considering all of those to be foreign is not the bigoted part. The bigoted part is ""not wanting to display symbols"" on that basis, or more correctly, to not want adherents of those religions to enjoy freedom of expression.

What's your best argument there? That we should allow Islam to spread here as well? This is a nation founded on Christian beliefs, not Islam. Even if you aren't religious, it's still culturally Christian. Besides that, this law is to prevent all public showings of religious symbols that are ostentatious."

You touch on a lot of points and I really like all of them.

I think that as you put it ‚Äúracially insensitive acts‚Äù are now wholly grouped with racism‚Äîwhich I don‚Äôt agree with but that‚Äôs another CMV.

I don‚Äôt think that painting your face black constitutes racism but yes, I would consider it racially insensitive.  I think my biggest complaint with society today is that we don‚Äôt separate the two.  Someone that dresses as Diana Ross is accused of being a racist which to me is instantly grouping them with the KKK/white supremacy.

Sure people can drive, but the logistics are more difficult. The city I'm living in is over 100x the population of my rural town in a marginally larger area. 1% of a million folks is a 10000 person protest.

Let me rephrase, the constant struggle with my son that was breastfeeding was the hardest thing I have ever done. I went through IVF and had a pretty rough c section and breastfeeding trumps everything. Then the mental battle within myself to stop breastfeeding was even worse. Formula feeding was best for me and my family for many reasons, but I had so much guilt and shame for not being able to do it successfully, it made me very depressed. A lot of that came from doctors and other people constantly saying ‚Äúbreast is best‚Äù etc. well, it‚Äôs not best when you start to resent your child for not being able to do it. There were very dark days. We are now 2 months pp and exclusively formula feeding. I‚Äôm not sure that I even want to try BF  for any future children. I totally understand now and hold no judgements. I don‚Äôt even care about the reasons why people don‚Äôt do it. They just don‚Äôt want to or whatever. Who cares? There are many benefits to breastfeeding and there are equally as many benefits of formula feeding. "

"&gt;amending 

Amending isn't repealing m8. 

Prop 5 is an ammendment similar to props 60 and 90, as outlined in the link. 

Prop 13 will still be here, even if prop 5 passes. 

*The following is my opinion*

If you vote yes, all you're doing is allowing those over 55 an unlimited number of tax transfers. 

This will benefit boomers the most because they got in early and pay lower property taxes than later generations.

It will *especially* help *rich* boomers who can afford multiple houses and thus can afford to move their tax burden around.

It allows boomers to buy the nicer houses at a tax discount, while younger people like myself are stuck with very small houses from the 1920s and relatively high tax burdens. (this is actually true, lol).

Also I am planning on having kids eventually and I don't want to see *less* funding for public schools because boomers lifted up the ladder. I can't afford private school and I don't trust charters, so there's that.

I'm not going to yell at you on the Internet if you vote yes, and I certainly won't call you a paid shill.

I think teams might have a read on when we run because we use it so sparingly with Collins and know exactly when to stack the box because we are too predictable with it.

So the box may be stacked on a fair amount of his runs but also on our obvious passing downs they spread the defense.

Edit: I seem to have upset many people with this comment. I wanted to make clear that I wasn't talking about porn or role play. I was talking about a real life couple who really want to have kids and where a proposal to have a baby is a happy, sweet moment where you cuddle and make love after.

"Just want to add to the number of instructors telling you it happens, it‚Äôs okay, and no one is going to think less of you for this. As a TA, I once walked into office hours to find a student from another class crying. We talked, I tried to comfort her and help her with her questions, and that was it. Honestly I forgot about it shortly afterwards until I saw her a few weeks later and she said something like, ‚Äúno tears this time!‚Äù If she hadn‚Äôt said that, I never would‚Äôve remembered. 

I‚Äôve also been the one crying in a similar type of situation, except it was when I was a CC instructor. I was trying to decide to stay in my job or leave (I was more stressed than I had ever been and my mental health had seriously deteriorated throughout the year yet people at work thought I was doing fine). In the decision making process, I cried in front of our lab coordinator and the dean (my boss). It was okay. They both never mentioned it later and it (as far as I know) did not impact their opinions of me/my work. 

Anyways, please don‚Äôt add this to your list of things to stress about. I promise it was a much bigger deal to you than it was to your professor. It will be okay. :)"

"This is a question of opinion. I hate the taste of beef, because I was raised eating poultry and fish. But over time I gradually started enjoying beef. I'm sure to most people, when I first told them I balked at the taste of beef, that was unthinkable. It's because my taste buds weren't used to it. 

&gt;If you think a lion will give two shits about turning around and eating you

Hahah! I wouldn't place any bets on myself against a lion! But you did raise an interesting point. Nature isn't humane. Mostly because they don't have moral agency or the capacity to question their actions. But we as humans do. Is killing for pleasure morally justifiable? We rarely kill for necessity unless we are somewhere remote with no food, so all our commercial killing is purely for the pleasure of taste right?

&gt;there's not really a reason not to, unless you're hurting someone else. 

Absolutely, and I agree with you on this. The question of personal choice is tricky because we usually don't take into account externalities. So for example, meat consumption is the leading cause of deforestation as we need farmland and agriculture to grow feed for the animals. The usage of these resources is terribly inefficient because it takes anywhere between 500 - over 1000 gallons of water to produce a pound of beef. This deforestation causes greenhouse gases, the destruction of natural habitats etc. 
Humans are also victims of this, like the hog waste dumping in North Carolina. 

So with the existence of all these externalities, meat consumption does have a victim, or multiple victims. By your defiiniton, would it be ethical to consume meat?

And thank you for engaging with me in such a civil and well thought out way, I really do appreciate it!"

"Sidestep equals skill simply because it requires you to be good at it, there are different levels to it, the basic one is fairly easy to learn but does take a little practice to perform every move perfectly, aka requires skill (being good at something).

It is fair because both parties have this tech at their disposal (or had it) and if you get caught in a sidestepping combo by your opponent then it's your fault for taking the bait he put up for you or for timing your moves poorly. This is the same in every competitive fighting game, if you misplay, you get punished.

The difference between DBL and other fighting games is that not only are our controls a bit limited but also the damage scaling in long combos are well done in other games, same cannot be said here, Goten for example can shred through your character like you're paper because the damage he deals is practically the same with every card, rather than each card dealing significantly less damage the longer your combo goes."

"MHA could actually make a pretty good movie.  The pacing is really fast in the anime and manga so I feel like you could adapt a single arc pretty well into a movie without missing much.  And the story itself is pretty solid, but still generic enough that a general population would engage with it (unlike with things like Metal Gear Solid, Warcraft, Death Note, etc which are inherently more risky).  And it would be incredibly easy to set it in America and have it be a Hollywood production.  Which surprisingly it is.


The big weaknesses - MHA is basically X-Men but with the mutants being accepted into society.  That might hurt its reception as a live action film with general audiences, we already have a handful of X-Men clones where teenagers have super powers, so it could come across as another one of those.  Another major weakness is that the villains in the show, even after 3 seasons, are really weak characters.  In the anime it seems mostly intentional as the main villain is sort of growing into his role, and it doesn't really matter because 90% of the focus is on the good guys learning how to become super heroes.  But in a feature length film having weak villains is really bad because they end up taking up like 40% of the plot.  The last big issue is getting actors.  I could see Tom Holland be an American Midoriya, but other than that its hard to get actors who actually look like teenagers that are actually good actors.


This is all assuming that the people doing the script actually like the show and appreciate it in the same way that general fans do.  Which is definitely not always the case.  Don't get me wrong, I'm like 99% sure this will be a shit-show, but it'll be a shit-show because the people involved will be inept and not because its unadaptable."

"Ask your dad whether he went to the French consulate, and made a French birth certificate for you when you were born. If he did, the process is very easy (I just did it). You go to the consulate, get the certificate, and they send off the request right there. Then, you come back in a week for your passport.

If your dad didn‚Äôt get a birth certificate for you, call the consulate and ask what to do. It may be that they will need his ‚Äúlivret de famille‚Äù or family book, or some other documents. If you don‚Äôt speak French, they will still be able to work with you. If your dad speaks French, you could have him call as well.

You may need to physically go to a consulate. There is one in D.C. Make sure you bring all your supporting documents with you (American identification, pictures for the passport, a debit card to pay, and I think that‚Äôs it.) Here is their page in French.

"Karin's best all around jumping attack is medium kick, because of the great hitbox, fast startup and crossup properties. Heavy kick/punch are both good too for the damage, but in general you save those for when the hit is guaranteed (DP punish, stun)

If you land any jumping medium/heavy attack, the standing heavy punch will combo, however you should actually use c.HP because it has the same followups with more damage. 

V trigger does not innately give frame advantage, but it does cancel the ending lag of many attacks including Karins s.HP. You can do s.HP -&gt; v trigger -&gt; s.HP. If both standing heavy punches are blocked you can still cancel heavy punch into Orochi to remain safe on block (-1). 

Orochi has three general purposes. The most important is that the non-ex version is safe on block. If you are doing any of your usual blockstrings and see that they are blocking just end in orochi to remain safe. 

ex. Orochi does a ton of damage and stun, making it ideal for all of Karins max damage combos. 

Normal orochi can also be used as a max damage ender in meterless combos, but it's a lot harder online than some of her other options.

I would say I'm a trustworthy fellow, I say in the humblest way possible."" He gives a teasing wink, attempting at some humor after a heavy topic. Perhaps it's more of a defensive mechanism, but it tends to do him good. ""I trust you too,"" he then says, eyes elsewhere. ""You're, uh,  a good friend. A good person."" "

It is possible they've opted to go with the implied randomness as you suggest, but it would be the first time that they didn't call out a purely random ability by using the random keyword to my knowledge.

It's really simple: you whisper ""Q""

The idea is that you don't blow through the hole in your lips, you blow downwards, across it, like blowing across the neck of a coke bottle, albeit from the inside.

The easiest way to explain this is with speech sounds.

First up, you want to aim a stream of air at the bottom of your lower incisors. Hump your tongue up against your hard palate for a cat / lizard / vampire hiss: hhhkkhkhkhkhhh.

Second part is the tip of the tongue. This controls the pitch - all the way down/back like you're saying awwwww for low, all the way up/forward (yyyyyyy) for high. You want smack bang in the middle to start out, so position it for uuuuhhh.

Last and least important, your lips. Make a really relaxed 'oo' shape. Don't purse 'em up like you're going to teach your grandmother, keep it super loose like you're muttering 'cool' in an offhand way.

khhkhkhhh-yeuhh-oooo - but all whispered, don't use your vocal cords.

Play around with it for a while and you'll get a hint of a breathy tone. Follow that, and practice until you can get it reliably. You'll find you can't make very high notes, and the tone is all breathy. That's OK, we fix that next.

Now you've got the basic tone, and can feel how to hold your mouth, now you tighten up your lips into a wwwww shape.  It's a little harder to hold the tone (which is why you didn't start there), but the tone will be pure and you'll be able to whistle high notes as well.

Enjoy, and ask if you have any questions.

"[You can read about it here](https://mattshub.com/2017/04/26/pid-tuning/).  Basically it goes through several heat/cool cycles on the hotend and heatbed, comparing the thermistor values and power supply to the heaters to determine the optimal amount of current to send to the heaters for a given temperature set point.  It takes several minutes to complete, but once it's finished, you should see more stable temps with fewer fluctuations.  Not sure it will help with your max temp issue, but worth a try.

Slowing down print speeds may also help with high temps.  Every mm of filament going through the nozzle is taking a little bit of heat away with it, slower speeds will reduce this.

[The MK3 product page](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3-kit.html) says the max hotend temp is 300C, I'm sure it's capable of printing at 270-280C."

"&gt; They are now asking if I would be willing to ‚Äúwork out a special rate for their models‚Äù AND ‚Äúreceive a commission for the models they send‚Äù me. Saying they have so many new model submissions,

 If you know these are professionals who are punctual, not wasting time, or they are more regularly giving you work, it can be worth it to charge less. With referrals from an agency you are spending less time and money on marketing. Also when you are working more regularly, the overhead cost per session, or per hour is effectively reduced. Your lens, and camera, and software, and tax costs are basically the same in total if you are working 20 hours a month, or 40 hours a week. I am not sure of the details of their commission plan but it does not sound like anything you can count on. It also depends on what your alternative is. If you have bills to pay, and plenty of time because there is a lull in other work it makes more sense to offer a discount.

There is a lot of non photography specific information on upselling clients for entrepreneurs. Offer multiple packages, or add ons, market a daily rate, or a rate based on the product and not the time it takes to effectively charge more per hour. "

It was either zombies or nerf turbo building, and we all know the console players would cry if the latter happened, so I guess this is how it had to be.

I had gestational diabetes during my pregnancy so my baby was prone to low blood sugar. They tested her every few hours. Her levels were low two times so they encouraged me to nurse more frequently or else if she had a third low level she had to be sent to special care. "

"I have two podcast suggestions you could try:

&amp;#x200B;

* News in Slow French
* FrenchPod101

&amp;#x200B;

News in Slow French is exactly what it sounds like: once a week there's a 10 minute episode where they talk about the week's news, speaking relatively slowly.

There's also an app and a website, where you can view the transcripts (which I find helpful, while listening to it, to be better tell what words they're saying).

&amp;#x200B;

FrenchPod101 is basically a series of French vocab lessons, delivered partly in English and partly in French.  It has a very casual, conversational style, which I find makes it fairly enjoyable to listen to.

The podcast has a new episode every day (quite short, usually between 2-10 minutes), but it only allows you access the episodes that came out within the past week, and deletes the ones from before that.  So if you check regularly and download the available each time, you can get lots of content, but at any given time, there's only a little bit of content available through the podcast, and you have to go to the website to access the rest."
I have called others out but I very rarely do so.  This is especially true for you considering you insult other posters more often than anyone else.

In answer to your question, no.  I have not put any bits of myself up for judgement.  This is because, despite my wife's assurances, I don't believe anyone would like to see them.  I lack body-confidence.

As to your point, don't be sad.  If someone has the confidence to put themselves out there for judgement, they have already won.  Just because there are people like me who might not like it, that's the point of being judged.  Some like, some don't.

And you consider this ""some hitter"" theory plausible?  How did the ""hitter"" know

* Teresa would be at the ASY;

* Avery and Teresa would both stop using their phones at the same time?

* Avery would have no alibi?

* Avery would have a fire in the burn pit, even though he was denying having one before the bones were found?

And

* where did he get Avery's blood to plant?

* how did he keep it from coagulating before he planted it;

* where was the RAV4 when he planted the blood;

* how did he shoot a bullet from Avery's gun and put Teresa's dna on it and replace the gun without anyone knowing?

* how did the ""hitter"" plant the key in Avery's trailer while the cops were there?

There are plenty more. I'll bet they had to pay this ""hitter"" a lot of money to keep his mouth shut for a dozen years . . .and that he asked for more when MaM came out.  Or did they have a hitter hit the hitter?

"**Day 1 :**

Long Run

**2 :**

AM easy run (30-60 minutes)

PM 5/3/1 Bench + accessory work

**3 :**

AM rest/light stretching

PM 5/3/1 Squat + accessory work w/ sprints

**4 :**

AM easy run

PM rest / yoga

(these could be swapped if you want more rest before the run)

**5 :**

AM easy run

PM 5/3/1 Press + accessory work

**6 :**

AM rest/light stretching

PM 5/3/1 deadlift + accessory work w/ tempo run

**7 :**

rest

&amp;#x200B;

You could also alternate **Day 3** each week, doing your 5/3/1 Squat + sprint one week and deadlift + tempo run the next. This is what I do, but I program in the movement I'm not doing as my main lift that week as an accessory movement in a different rep scheme or as part of a circuit. If I'm doing squats as the main lift that week, some variation of deadlift is programmed in between that and the sprints that day.

**Day 6** becomes a sub-maximal ""dynamic effort"" day. Lately I've been doing 5 x 3 sets of overhead squats, low bar squats, front squats, and deadlifts using roughly 50-60% of my 1RM of each (20 sets total). In between each set I do a few reps of a different pull-up variation and jog 150 meters. I warm up and cool down with 150 meter jogs, so I end up with 3200 meters (2 miles) jogged along with all of the dynamic lifting. This workout sounds like a monster on paper and does take about 40 minutes, but I keep the intensity on this workout super low so it's manageable and it ends up being a lot of fun."

"Right, because 50% of the population shouldn't get to have an opinion on the killing of their unborn children. Especially if they are going to be on the hook if the woman decides to bring the baby to term. We should all just shut up and let you kill as many children as you want and define when life begins and force men to raise children they don't want or kill the ones they do. Because for some unfathomable reason having a vagina make you the moral authority on when it is ok to kill unborn children and when it isn't. No, a man having an opinion on this means you don't get to have peace and quiet inside of your echo chamber. How about this; you don't get to have an opinion on anything to do with men or boys. Ever. You can just shut the fuck up and mind your own business and we will be however we want to be and do whatever we want to do. Does that work for you? I bet you are the kind of cunt who would get pregnant, book an abortion without discussing it or caring about what the man wants, then demand the man cover the expense as well. God forbid that he should give you his opinion on it. That would just be sexist. When abortion becomes a safety net for lauzy fucks who can't use contraception we get people like you. Just consider that if your parents were as low-rent as you seem to be, maybe you would not even exist and we would not be arguing right now. What a pleasant thought."

Remember that we are talking about kids here. 14/15 year old brains are not fully developed, and it is unreasonable to expect them to make the same decisions that a grown adult would.

"If you're injecting Factories into Factories, then you're still doing the same thing as AddScoped or AddTransient somewhere.

AddScoped uses a Factory provided by the DI container to inject a dependency that is reused over the entire request.  AddTransient uses a Factory provided by the DI container to provide a new instance each time it's requested.

So no, technically you don't need anything other than AddSingleton and you could AddSingleton your own Factory and use it to provide scoped or transient objects as required...  But AddScoped and AddTransient are there so you can do it at the composition root rather than pushing the Scoped/Transient/Singleton logic into the classes themselves, because it often differs between Unit Tests, Development, and Production.

"&gt;There is really no cost associated with generating a key so I don't really see why there would be a fee.

I think you've conflated a security key and the key generator device that you have to pay Duo for.

&gt;but its fair to ask the question, ""Why is there a fee associated?""

Generating keys does not cost the end user anything with the Duo app. The fee only comes into question if you have no device such as a smartphone or table which can install the Duo app. This is when you would have to purchase a *physical device* from Duo that will have your key instead of your smartphone.

&gt;I just wish I could use Google Authenticator.

The Duo app is free just like Google Authenticator and contains all the security key functionality that Google Authenticator has. Duo supports the exact same six digit key authentication that Google does, but if you have a system that supports RSA token authentication via push notifications, like Shibboleth (the authentication service we use at RIT), it is disabled. This is because RSA token authentication through the app is more secure and more convenient than using seeded authentication codes.

&gt;Its simple, easy and effective, and its free to use.

Believe me. I understand that it's annoying to have multiple authentication apps. I have Google Authenticator, Duo, Microsoft Authenticator, Blizzard Authenticator, the Steam app (which includes a 5 character auth generator), and a password manager with an associated key generator. I too wish they would consolidate, but out of all of them, Duo contains all the security related features of the other apps except password management. In fact, Google Authenticator has the fewest features after Blizzard. None of these apps cost anything for the end user, except for the paid version of the password manager, which I don't have.

&gt;2FA is a good thing. Nobody is arguing that.

This entire argument was spawned by someone who undercut the benefits of 2FA because of one method, which was not his only option, that is not the most secure, and I addressed specifically why having any second level of security is generally worth the cost.

Edit: ""Duo contains all the features of the other apps"" changed to ""Duo contains all the security related features of the other apps"""

"I learned to play drums on a 4 piece kit.  It was fun playing songs from the 60's like The Beatles.   But the more I played on that kit I was finding it difficult to play songs from Toto, Asia, The Police, Styx, Rush.  Etc.  As time went on. And I was able to expand my vision and dreams.  I purchased abigger kit.  I've become pretty creative with my 8-10-12-14 Tom's with 2 crashes, 1 ride a splash and a China.  As matter of fact I find it more fun.  Just because I have all that doesn't mean I need to use it all the time.  Each piece is used creatively.

"&gt; But they do not just disappear, they just go and do something else where there is less competition. We're talking about megacorp branch office vs. whole planet's worth of pops, not mom's &amp; pop's shops.

Where exactly would they go, though? Other worlds will also have their own existing economy, and a comparatively small company won't have the same means as the megacorporation that displaced them to assert dominance. Not to mention that a company cannot just transplant itself; in most cases their employees are free-willed and may not be willing to just immigrate to an entirely different planet, perhaps even a different empire. Everyone, company and workforce, would have to liquidate their local assets and start a new life elsewhere.

In the end, a corporation's managers will prioritize their own prosperity before that of the company, and if the interstellar megacorp is performing a hostile takeover, it's likely they'll keep their jobs anyways, just under a different brand.

In this sense, perhaps I've worded the scenario badly: competition will not be displaced, but rather absorbed.

&gt; I feel like it is more to simulate exchange of products that just can't be really done locally, not just ""we can make alloys more efficient"". Like megacorp dealing with ""best in universe"" entertainment while also taking local cuisine and culture back to sell on the home planet.

Hmm, not how a megacorporation would usually act, based on real life observations -- but this interpretation would prevent most of the ""fallout"" one would expect.

&gt; I'd love to have something like ability to have multiple food types and then pop being able to get any combination of them, (so 1, or 0.5 of 2 type, or 0.33 of 3 types of food etc.) but having more than one type gives boosts for variety. Then bind types of foods produced to types of planets (making ""space rice"" on arid planet will probably not be very efficient etc.) and make some of them (""exotic food/spices"") be attainable only via branch offices and inter-empire trade, and similarly for other resources.

Sounds rather complex, but something in this direction could be possible via mods at least on an abstracted level. It kind of remembers me of how STNH introduced a bunch of unique resources as luxury goods you can trade... and we already know that some types of Pops need specific resources based on Job/Strata.

Perhaps a sort of workaround where you can collect trade goods as strategic resources, and each resource of this type acquired affects an Empire Modifier which in turn generates the final product, which can be consumed by Pops? In addition, each resource acquired would generate a one-time empire-wide Happiness boost.

For more, I think the game would require more under-the-hood changes in this regard."
"I mean that entirely depends on the series, but Soulcalibur V sold 1.3 million and was considered a flop, so reason stands that Soulcalibur VI should exceed that if the series is to continue. Soulcalibur IV sold 2 million copies so you would hope this game would sell as many as two installments ago.

For some recent fighting games: Dragon Ball FighterZ sold two million copies in its first week alone; Injustice 2 sold 1.5 million copies in its first three months; Mortal Kombat X sold five million copies in under a year; Tekken 7 sold 3 million copies in under a year; and Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite sold 1 million copies in its first four months, and was considered a failure.

"DOS 2 EE
Classic

Got this game since Oktober and am trying to get a first decent playtrough on it.
However i messed up my first attempt so am now trying a second time.
I am settled on the idea that i want to play an undead character but i have some difficulty with deciding what subrace (Lizard, Human, Elf) Either way it's gonna be a female (So far leaning towards Lizard side)

But the biggest problem i have is.
I can't think of a half decent build to complete act 1 with (and continue onwards to act 2)
So far all i've got is.
Undead Lizard Warfare/poly
Red Prince Wizard (Pyro/Earth)
Lohse Enchanter (Hydro/Air)
And Sebille Archer (planning to Huntsman/Summmoner her)

However already from the start this feels as if it clashes with itself alot. (Also i end up burning and shocking myself up quite a bit)

Anyone any idea for a half decent but fun build to give my party?"

"Rainfall simulations are great for erosion and river/lake formation. There are plenty of great tutorials out there, but basically you give each point on your map a rain depth value, something low to start out. Then you calculate the slope of each point on your map, and run multiple passes over the map where you update each point by moving moisture out based on the steepness in whatever direction the slope faces (add wetness to altitude so you don't try to feed a location that has a towering 100m stack of water just because it is 2m lower). You can erode the terrain based on the speed the water is flowing at (steepness calculated with water depth added to terrain height.)

You can play with simulating *where* rain would fall based on prevailing winds and terrain features (mountains tend to intercept the rain from passing clouds, leaving drier regions behind them if the wind is a constant direction)

That method tends to be on the more expensive side to calculate, so you might also consider placing just a few water droplets down onto your terrain randomly, and tracing out whatever path they follow down the terrain as being a river, growing in size the longer its length."

Going up against Ozai in a battle of will he was nearly overwhelmed because forcing himself on another being is not really Aang's thing. When that battled shifted it was because Aang found some inner strength of conviction that let him get over himself, for lack of better phrase, and force his will on Ozai.

I don't doubt he has an anxiety disorder and suffers from panic attacks, but I do think sometimes he uses hyperbole to be dramatic, equating feeling overwhelmed with having a panic attack. I think throughout this series many things were happening off camera that we are unaware of that made Shane feel stressed and anxious about continuing. Add in the audience reaction while Shane is still filming and trying to piece together the narrative and you've got yourself a recipe for disaster.

"I have a Pyrenees. I live in a bachelor pad and we always have people over for board games, roomies girlfriends, etc..my doggo is happy as can be to greet and socialize. 

My room though, it is our space. He has his food there, it's where we sleep. I don't let many people in aside from the occasional girl. 

One dude I didn't even know decided to open my door and come into my room unannounced to ask me for a cigarette after I had went to bed, when there was a party at our place.

My Pyrenees leapt off the floor like a tiger, directly for his throat. Chased the dude down the stairs. The way he was so silent before he leapt was unnerving. He gave no warning, he just wanted to kill this intruder. The dude-bro that barged into my room luckily slapped him away, and I was awake watching TV enough that I was on my feet. I had grabbed his collar and my pyr had dragged me halfway down the stairs before I could grab the handrail to stop him dragging me down the stairs, snarling and barking. If I weren't a rather large dude who works out, I think some random bro would have had to have stitches and my dog would have been court ordered to be put down.

After I had dragged my cujo dog into my room, I came down to see this guy hyperventilating and having a full on panic attack. I felt bad, but...you do not mess with a Great Pyrenees. It was the scariest thing I've ever seen from the sweetest, most cuddly dog I know

"If the game developer was specifically looking to host files in a decentralized manner then I suppose Sia would be a good fit, however, when I think about the benefits a blockchain could bring to a game designer, I more-so think about digital items/ assets.

For example, if a player collects loot after completing a dungeon, the earned loot is a digital object that they can then carry forward into games that also integrate ""loot-asset-standard"" (for lack of a better term.)

It allows items to span a universe or across games, and not be siloed to one playing experience. There can also develop a real economy built on a secondary market of scarce 'strong' loot/weapons, or even an in game credit system.

Not really I'm just stating another fact. You are close minded and dumb. I used to dislike cops, not close to hating them but thinking they can be pretty sketchy until I actually looked into the bullshit the media spews out and left the anti-cop echo chamber that is reddit.

"I was somewhat optimistic for Starlink but I haven't picked it up because gameplay videos all look very samey to me, and reviews seem to confirm that. If I understand it correctly, the game is relatively long, and you must fly to planets but the objectives seem to be similar on many of them. You take out footmen, big pillars, and a boss. I love space shooters, but it looks like it plays more like a generic 3rd person shooter when in ground combat, in which you circle strafe around enemies while jumping and firing weapons. That doesnt look particularly skillful, deep, or even difficult. Then you can build these bases and grind for resources to upgrade your weapons, which seems like kinda a bad system.

Usually when I encounter these mechanics, you can either ignore them and brute force your way through, or the enemies are too tough and you need upgrades, forcing you to grind. Maybe it works better in Starlink but it doesnt seem great.

The resolution on the Switch version also looks to be extremely poor, and I see framerate dips on top of it, which is a nausea-inducing combo. But I cant buy somewhere else because I would really want to play the Star Fox content as well.

I'd love for my concerns to be wrong though."

It wasn't a huge shock, they had let me know it was a possibility, but still, a surprise.  It was enjoyable and I returned the favor another time we were all together.

"Well,  that's like super hard to do. You're asking 3-4 different companies to work together. Doing this is similar to getting 3-4 people who don't have any interest in helping each other to go to dinner at a place that they have to pay to eat at. So for example, PWD detects a sewer leak that has caused subsidence and has wrecked a PECO power bank. Noether on of these people care if Verizon's FIOS line was damaged. So when Fios responds to a trouble call 3 months later they have to dig up a different section. Everyone is at the mercy of a 2nd and 3rd company called ""people who supply concrete and asphalt and you have to order it like Taconelli's. The day before if you expect to get it early. (best case scenario). So a bunch of city employees with little motivation to coordinated *(open 'street' permit office is the people who allow you to dig into the street) doesn't care because the boss of Streets is usually a political/viability job and all they do is promote green/zero vision stuff to further thier career than actualy stuff like paving streets, striping intersections correctly, and most certainly not the unrewarding job of help the contractors coordinate. Then chuck in every utility that for all intents and purposes actually compete. If PGW is working Verizon isn't going to enter their work site. That's like super no-no for insurance, Osha, etc. You can't have one set of people enter a worksite near equipment that isn't your company. So lots of stuff and there's more but it gives you an idea.

I love scallops so I was super excited to try this. The recipe is in LoseIt as ‚Äúlemon basil scallop stir fry‚Äù but I eliminated 50% of those items lol. So here‚Äôs my modified recipe. 

1/2 lb of scallops
1 1/2 cup fried rice veggies + broccoli 
2 tsp olive oil
1 1/2 cup cauliflower rice
2 tsp toasted sesame oil
4 cloves of garlic
4 tbsp of soy sauce (I doubled this from 2 because I was using cauli rice and I love my food to be covered in sauces, but I think it would‚Äôve been fine to use 2)
About 1 inch long chunk of ginger
2 tbls sugar

Mix sesame oil, sugar, garlic, ginger, and soy sauce in a bowl. Heat the olive oil over a skillet or wok and add scallops, cook for 3 mins. Remove scallops, add veggies and cook through. Toss in cauli rice. Add sauce and let it boil. Add back scallops, reduce heat, cook for 1 minute. This is 2 servings of the stir fry, the recipe in LoseIt is 190 cal/serving (not including rice). 

It would‚Äôve taken like maybe 20 mins for a normal person to cook this. But I have to use a garlic press because I‚Äôm bad at knife skills and I tried to press garlic through as well lol. Not a good idea. 

Also if I were to make it again, I would add the scallops and sauce back at the same time. I felt like the scallops didn‚Äôt absorb enough of the flavor. "

I thought he was joking. What a weird, uncomfortable question. Especially to a 17 year old. Especially the first time meeting; the first conversation. Naturally, I tried to keep the fun going. I said I can't marry her because she's not Jewish (I am).

Apparently that was the wrong answer. I think he learned to tolerate me. But that relationship (with him, with the ex was great) started poorly and probably ended only slightly better."

"Okay, so let's get this straight.

Miley wanted to ""express who she really was"" by jumping into a genre she expressed little to no appreciation for beforehand (hip-hop), which resulted in the most critically and commercially acclaimed album of her career. She then ditched it entirely in favor of ""expressing who she really was"" with more experimental and unusual material that garnered mixed reviews. After hypocritically [badmouthing the genre that brought her out of irrelevancy](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/miley-cyrus-hip-hop-comments), she decided to drop a country record to ""express who she really was"" but abandoned it after it tanked. And now she's back doing hip-hop, probably to express who she really is.

"Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm a little too skeptical, But these mail bombs seem a little fishy. Everyone is so quick to assume it‚Äôs a right wing attack but being pissed at Debbie Wassermann Schultz can point to an angry Bernie supporter too. I see this because I‚Äôm a Still kind of a Bernie supporter and I feel like Shultz is the reason we ended up with a candidate that was difficult to vote for and handed trump the keys to the white house. I know I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way... also, intercepting a bunch of bombs meant for democratic celebrities is only going to make more people come out to vote for democrats. why would an angry conservative opt to do something that will boost democrat support?

the timing of it makes it odd too. It‚Äôs right before midterm elections. That‚Äôs the only reason I feel hesitant to assume this is a selfish hateful person simply seeking revenge. I feel like they want this to influence the midterm elections...

Which leaves me more puzzled because I just can‚Äôt see a way this situation benefits conservatives. Even if the sender got their revenge they screw over their own party. It always works out to benefit democrats. Even if the packages blew up in the hands of their targets only two of them are in office, so you barely took out any democrats running things and you just brought out more democratic voters just in time for elections. One got sent to CNN so you know the sender wanted this to get a lot of attention, but if any one of those packages had blown up CNN would have been all over it so I feel like the one sent to CNN was so this would make the news without them blowing up. 

I don‚Äôt know. I need more information on the sender before I know which parties ideologies influenced these actions. I feel like we will hear from the sender soon to clarify why they put Shultz as the return Address. "

"Really? Well, boo; that just seems fun to think about.

Surely nothing -- even in Muggle genetics -- is as simple as dominant or recessive anymore.  Magic has at least some potential epi-genetics, as seen in the creation of an Obscurial. And there must be separate markers for things like metamorphmagi, divination, legilimency, Pareselmouths.  I wonder if Newt's ability with animals is at least in part a genetic gift like that.  Maybe Squibs come wired for magic, and a Muggle doctor could find and flip a genetic switch that would turn their magic on. \*gasp\* or off!

Now I'm worried that Muggle advances in CRISPr technology will cause magic genetics to be wiped out of the human population.

Because she will have more meaningful mantras, of course its a given that the passive would be nerfed to actually house such powerful mantra spells. A good karma player will be able to have their ult up still by poking, and will as a result of the shield nerf, receive more damage. So what are they killing again???

"Parachute hitbox sucks balls, give you that. But if you get used to it its actually quite predictable (thats still not great ofcourse).

‚ÄûDesync‚Äú is a word that gets kinda used a lot, i guess you mean ping + netcode and resulting problems like getting shot behind walls.
Nearly all shooters have that problem. battlefield was notorious for that for yeeaaars. Its actually incredibly hard to do hitreg well, think about it, how does one deal with ping from each player 30 ms each, if you run behind a wall even 10 ms makes a huge difference?

There are 2 easy ways to fix that, shooters advantage (what we have now) or taget advantage, which would result in the shooter missing shots when on his end they clearly connected, leading shots would be incredibly hard because you would have to lead differently dependent on your and your targets ping (that would suck balls hard)

Its that noticeable in pubg because hits are more defined and sharp then, say, COD. 

Battlefield after years developed a quite sophisticated system where the hitreg changes depending on the pings of all parties. And you get still hit in cover sometimes..

So yeah it happens, and it never feels good, but the pings are getting better, and so this problem gets better aswell, also think about it that way: on his screen you disappeared behind the wall later, but you also appear later from cover (giving you peekers advantage)

I never encountered invis walls in 600h played, but i heard about them, thats shit ofcourse..


Daaang it got a bit long, sorry, but thats my thoughts about it..what really suck are fences that block bullets :p"

HAHAHAHA, well done coach, serves him right for speaking down to the girl, glad he got the crap scared out of him

Nice to see the mechs also have manuals as well. First training, now manuals, I like the realism aspect to how the mechs would be learnt and operated. More of this please shows.

So much for your partnership. Kind of takes two for that and you seem to be the only one who actually wants it.

That is the most neon pink blush I've ever seen after her conversation with not-Vash. Why do I get the feeling he just wants to pair with her to humiliate her or use her as bait though

So that battle all up achieved absolutely nothing. She didn't do anything, they didn't seem to do any damage to the enemy that they mentioned, and she's alone once again. Those things move seriously fast to have to try and attack though that's for sure.

We already have legitimate democratic power in this country, which we love and regard as legitimate.  So we don't need to break the laws, which are our instrruments.

We think there should be the ordinary legal consequences for those misdeeds.

That terrifies them and makes them see us as an existential threat.  But that is their guilt talking, not us.  We don't even equate those misdeeds with the democrat party, which we think should just move the hell on and get less corrupt and criminal leadership.  But that is their affair; if they don't we will just go on beating them in elections on jobs not mobs, American prosperity for all and law and order.

"Learning another language is definitely helpful in more ways than one. If you spend a few hundred hours getting comfortable writing idiomatic code, then its philosophy gets into your head and your programmer‚Äôs tool box gets that much bigger.

Scala is such a large language that it‚Äôs essentially possible to write it in two styles: either ‚ÄúJava without semicolons‚Äù, or functional. Having done a bit of the former, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it and if I needed a JVM language I‚Äôd look into Kotlin instead; the latter style (functional, full Scala enlightenment) is hard to pick up unless you‚Äôre on a team that embraces it or contributing to a good open source project. But if you‚Äôre looking for a functional language, for front end I‚Äôd suggest Elm, and for back end I‚Äôd suggest Elixir. They both have active and helpful communities.

TypeScript is probably the safest bet commercially because JS is everywhere these days. Personally I steer clear of JS because it‚Äôs not a great language and node‚Äôs async style angers me (its creator now prefers Go, if that says anything).

Personally, most of my professional coding for the last two years has been in Go and I love it because the language is for the most part very well designed. I prefer static languages because of the reasons you mentioned (maybe it‚Äôs just because I got my start in C++, but I think even in Python if I don‚Äôt know what type 95% of my variables should be, I‚Äôm doing something wrong). And Go has implicit fulfillment of interfaces, which is kinda like duck typing with compile time checks."

"This is a difficult decision. I was 30 with my first pregnancy, and my OB strongly recommended NIPT--it's the latest and greatest and most accurate, and it's certainly going to replace all the other screening blood tests in the near future. I was very fortunate in that my insurance covered it in full for reasons I still don't understand (I was also in the lowest risk category). But it turned out that our daughter had Trisomy 18--picked up by both NT and NIPT. So obviously, we'll be doing both NIPT and NT from now on--even though my husband and I are both only 31 and even though her form of Trisomy 18 was completely random and unlikely to recur. 

&amp;#x200B;

In your case, it's a little less straightforward--it's likely not going to be covered in full, and you're also going to be doing a separate CHD workup. Do you have a sense of how much NIPT will cost to you? Also, will your CHD workup include an amnio? If it's really expensive and you'll be getting an amnio anyway, I'd probably stick with the less expensive first trimester screening. That way, in the unlikely event that the first trimester screening misses something, the amnio will pick it up (albeit later than you would have found out otherwise). But if the test happens to be relatively affordable (and your insurance might surprise you, like mine did), and you do not plan on doing an amnio, then I might just spring for the NIPT.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to consider is whether you'd feel comfortable and confident with low-risk results from the non-NIPT screening. Or would you be more likely to doubt them, knowing that there's a more accurate/sensitive test out there? (I'm not saying you \*should\* doubt them, but some might struggle with that.)

&amp;#x200B;

Tough decision! Especially when you've had a previous loss."

Title: **Water Leak/High Bill due to improper installation. Who pays the bill?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I am renting a home and we got a high water bill. It is usually $70 and this month our bill was $250. I immediately called the water company and they sent someone out to investigate. The day I called I shut off the irrigation system because there is a little standing water where it irrigates. 4 days later the investigator came out and we shut off the house water and the irrigation was already shut off. It was flowing at 2 Gal/minute still indicating a leak. I immediately notified the property management company via email and called their emergency maintenance hotline. The next day they got a plumber out who found that there was a cracked PVC pipe in the yard where (whoever installed it) had threaded a galvanized pipe into the PVC pipe in a manner in which the galvanized pipe stuck up out of the dirt. Most likely this was to add a spicket to the line later. He said they never should screw metal into plastic and this is why it cracked. The line could not have been shut off as it was connected to the line between the meter and the main shut off. The plumber repaired it that day but the property management company says that we have to pay the water bill even though it was due to improper installation and not in any way due to my own negligence. There was no water ""bubbling out of the ground"" and due to the recent rain and the irrigation line we could not have reported it any sooner. 
&gt; 
&gt; Who should have to pay the bill. If I really am responsible please tell me but I just don't think that sounds right as it was whoever installed the line that is to blame for faulty and improper installation.

Right now, I've got Kittle and Trey Burton as TEs. There's a chance I can trade Burton for Alshon Jeffery, but I'm hesitant, would appreciate some input. 

My WR2 is Josh Gordon. Alshon seems like an upgrade, but the TE scarcity this year is spooking me. I've been lucky to have two good TEs. If Kittle goes down, Burton's ready on my bench. There's no other quality TEs on waivers.

Is Alshon Jeffery enough of an upgrade to shoulder the risk of having just Kittle at TE? 

My other receivers are: OBJ, Josh Gordon, Tre'Quan Smith, Amari Cooper"

"Now I'm no pro Eidolon hunter, but just like you, I just recently started Eidolon hunting as a duo so here's my experience and answers for your question. My reply is more of a, ""This will work"" instead of a ""This is an optimal duo set up"" so don't know how useful this will be for you aha

&gt; Personally, I asked my friend to bring a Trinity while me being the Chroma. It might not be necessary but it keeps the lures up and me up as well for the damage phase ~~because I'm a boob and forget to re cast my abilities~~

&gt; Optimal is Madurai, but I use Zenurik (since I don't have madurai) and it's quite nice, let's me Regen energy after the magnetic phase while I'm taking down shields with my operator. 

&gt; Build an amp first. It's possible with Mote but super time consuming. Chucking a few forma would be nice on the Lanka to fit more mods since you'll be the dps as Chroma. Personally I have 4. I also brought a throwing secondary with concealed explosives to amp up my damage

&gt; I built my Chroma with as much strength then duration second. I did sacrifice efficiency and range but it works~ My friend who bought Trinity built for duration and efficiency with a bit of strength to get the max damage resistance from her blessing.

Again, this isn't the best duo set up but it works with Teralyst fight taking 10-15 mins depending on how nicely things turn out ahah

It was an amazing experience taking my first Eidolon so good luck and fun my dude :)

Edit: I said boob instead of noob but I can't stop laughing so I'll keep it

Edit 2: so it seems impossible with a mote only which I guess is true in my case. I have a 2/2/1 amp and my friend has a mote. He says he doesn't feel like he does anything. So at least have 1 person with a better amp :3"

The right constantly divides but then calls for unity. Their unity. 
"The problem is, it plays out one of two ways. 1) You enforce it on the services -- ineffective at best, and I don't think a 14 year old kid with a lot of time on his or her hands cares much about the rules of Facebook. Even strongly enforced, it's pretty hard to make reasonable demands of a social media company in that regard, without neutering the system as a whole to achieve that one goal. I'm sure as hell not going to submit proof of age to make a twitter post. 

The alternative brings me to 2), enforcing it on the user and most likely parents. Let's say, hypothetically, enforcement is strong (if it can't be, why approach it in the first place?), and in general, the consequences of legal charges are going to be worse than what they're trying to prevent. A dumb kid on social media who's otherwise responsible isn't served well by charges or fines on himself or his family. 

My first thought in that regard was pot enforcement -- the consequences of legal enforcement are way worse for an individual, than the consequences of an individual using it. Obviously, a 'social media' age law scales down by magnitudes, but the rule still kinda holds.

So yeah, probably not a great idea. It doesn't achieve any specific and complete benefit to society that I can identify, versus the means we have to control and enforce the issue.

Good question, though, and I had to give it a lot of thought. There's a lot of stupid things that kids can immortalize on the internet that can't be taken back, but the legal system is maybe not the best way of approaching that."

"&gt; I wouldn't disagree with any of this but all of this applies to men in nursing classes to.

And we should listen to both of these groups of people when they voice the struggles that they face. I don't see how this is relevant, we don't have a limited amount of help or sympathy to give. We can strive to do better for both of these people.

&gt; To act as if these small things should warrant some grand sympathy is ridiculous 

My point is that my girlfriend is never one to really constantly talk about ""how hard being a women in STEM"" is all the time, but sometimes she tells me about issues she faces and these are just a few of them. The things I listed were just a small list of things from 2nd-hand knowledge. I am sure certain women have had issues that cut deeper and harder, but just because every women in STEM hasn't had an absolutely awful experience that has left them in tears for weeks doesn't mean that women in STEM don't face systematic issues.

It takes as much effort to be sympathetic to someone as it does to intentionally deny your sympathy. If you want to live your life as if sympathy is some token that must be earned from you, then that is your choice. But personally I think that if someone voices that they are having an issue, no matter where it stems from, people should strive to help resolve that issue or at least be sympathetic towards the person facing the issue."

It gains that status once it can live without being directly attatched to me. Before that it's just a parasite with potential to be a person.

"You're being downvoted for the 'otherwise don't get involved' part of your comment. 

a) He is already involved, he is who the girlfriend went to for help and he lives with the boyfriend. And;

b) Not getting involved has an incredibly problematic history in relation to domestic violence. It's a crime that has historically been normalized and accepted through a culture of silence and the idea that it is a private matter that people outside of the relationship shouldn't get involved in. 
Encouraging people not to get involved or to see it as not their problem (when it is a community/social issue and we are all part of our communities/society) is a significant contributing factor in the prevalence of domestic violence. Culturally that is an attitude that needs to change, not be encouraged. "

"/u/JokerUnique never said 1.3 was fun, he stated that it was brutal and I played back in 1.3 as well. Trust me why I say that Joker saying it was ""brutal"" is putting it nicely.

As for the game being too easy on the PTS? Yeah it was. Here's the thing, when the first 1.4 PTS went up? It was a super refreshing walk in the park after dealing with the BS we had going on with 1.3 I know a few players laughed about mowing down Elite Shotgunners and the like on the PTS. But yeah the first PTS was way too easy.

The only thing I think Skill-Up really kinda ruined somewhat back then was Underground in the first 1.4 PTS just handed out a crap ton of loot. They lowered the drop rates and Underground sucked until they reworked it a few months back."

"It‚Äôs hard to make anyone view things from your perspective, even if you take the time to view things from their perspective, most people will judge things at face value and dismiss it.

This is why movies are amazing to me, 

they convey one‚Äôs perspective to another, brilliantly.

This movie has made people feel.

In any movie review of James Cameron‚Äôs AVATAR, we are mostly told it is praised for it‚Äôs CGI and not for it‚Äôs story. Which for the most part, lacked originality. Comparisons are made to previous stories. 

Stories such as Ferngully, Pocahontas, and Dances with Wolves. 

In fact, it was common for people to simply say, 

‚ÄúAVATAR is (insert movie) in space‚Äù. 

What astounds me is that while people compare AVATAR to these films, 

they do not compare it to the events and situations that these films are focused on. 

Events and situations that are still ongoing to this day.

AVATAR uses symbolism and imagery to portray the atrocities committed by the Corporatocracy. 

And, how our ignorance not only allows these atrocities to occur ‚Äî but, also has halted our evolution

AVATAR is not only a social commentary on the Extortion of Natural Resources, 

Exploitation of Indigenous Peoples, or Aboriginal Genocide. 

It is a simulation of what life can be.

It does what no film has EVER done before,showcase our connection to the Earth. 

Every claim in the analysis can be researched by anyone and a clear consensus can be reached.

"One thing you get from some stocks, especially at large or old companies, are periodic dividends. This is basically extra money doled out to stockholders simply for owning stock. It encourages the stockholders not to sell the stock, which weakens the economic strength of the company. 

Another thing is that you technically get to vote on certain shareholder decisions, primarily to vote for the people on the company's board of directors, as well as whether or not to make another offering of stock, or to split or combine existing stocks. Sometimes you get a few additional things to vote on like how the company should do business or how much the upper executives of the company should make. 

In practice however your vote is very small (it's directly proportionate to the number of stocks you have, amongst all the stocks out there) and it's rare that enough stockholders (that is, the holders of enough stocks) will vote against the status quo, as long as the company is doing well, anyway. It's so rare for them not to do so, that there is actually a term for it -- ""shareholder revolt."" 

It's kind of absurd, really, how it's done in practice. You will get an invitation once a year to cast your shareholder vote. At the very top of the page in big letters is a checkbox that basically says ""Count all my votes for whatever the current board of directors think is best."" 

Also, if you own a sufficiently large number of shares, you can propose an issue for the shareholders to vote on. In practice the number of shares required to do that is usually prohibitively high. And of course, the board of directors will nearly universally recommend *against* whatever it is.

(Incidentally, you also get to go to the annual stockholder meetings, which are typically very nice affairs, with a lot of rah-rah. Now, that doesn't probably do the average person much good unless the company's headquarters are nearby. And you're willing to blow PTO on it. I've meant to go to a few but never made the time.)

Being a US Senator
"You are saying that anything created by a sentient being is subjective. That is not the normally used definition of subjective from my experience. If you have seen it used this way before I would appreciate if you could examples of other physically existent things created by sentient beings that do not exist objectively? Statements that buildings or people and other objects are not objectively existent seems to me to fly in the face of any generally accepted definition of objective. At this point I also don't know what objective means since knowledge of a things origin is required in order to say it objectively exists as we have defined objective to mean something not created by a sentient being.

If you claim this to be true then you are also saying you do not have objective existence in the world because you are yourself a creation of a sentient being. If any of what I have said is contradicting what you are saying I apologise but I do not believe that it is. If it is I would like to know how you say anything can be said to exist objectively since you and all your thoughts are not an objectively existing thing? If they cannot be said to objectively exist we can make no definite statements about any objective thing or even the nature of objectivity itself. 

To me what subjective means and what the dictionary definition seems to point to is something being a feeling, a taste or a matter of opinion. I do not think it's fair to say that any physically existent objects existence is a matter of opinion nor a feeling of any other inconclusive type of belief. If you believe that to be the case you have not shown it. 

From what I can see your belief lies in the notion that a set of morals cannot be objectively created by something sentient. This implies that the act of creation or the nature of morals themselves contains something that implies subjectivity. Without some natural aspect of morality requiring subjectivity or some aspect of creation by a sentience to be inherently I do not see how you can say your premise holds and I do not see at what point in the creation of an objective set of morals (which we've said could exist in theory) they inherent their subjective quality. If you are saying being created by a sentient being causes it then I revert you to the beginning of this comment. "

Crappy transmission (made by GM I think?). In it's defense, in sport mode on the freeway, if you romped on it, it would immediately downshift from 4th to second. I've never driven an automatic since which would downshift so quickly when needed.

Every year either the microswitch or the selenoid involved in preventing the car from being shifted out of park unless the brake pedal was pressed broke.

I understand what you're saying but surely you've had a terrible batch that would essentially cost you money instead of making you money as well as eat up over an hour of your time. I've had batches where there was no free parking both at the store and at the delivery location. Once I had two Costco rotisserie chickens and a 10 pack of Yogurt to go to the 13th floor of downtown high-rise and minimum $5 parking fee. The asshole tipped me a dollar. I made $4.24+ $1 tip but paid $5 parking and wasted 45 minutes of my time driving around on one way streets in downtown of a major city fighting traffic. I only paid parking because I just wanted it over with. I was so pissed I just ended my shift. So there are good reasons to not take batches. IC needs to make it right for us and set minimum item limits for customers. 
"I don't disagree with what you've said, but I think its indicative of a few hollywood problems. There is a severe lack of creativity and storytelling to the point where all we get is this insipid do-overs. Creativity because everyone keeps going back to the well of retread stories. While there are cases where a story can be told and retold (A Star is Born is a fantastic example of that very thing being done right) we routinely see just mindless iteration for the sake of iteration. In short there are no complete stories because everyone is looking on how to make the next zillion dollars on iterative franchises. 

Look at a film like Million Dollar Baby. Strong story, good characters, definite ending. They aren't going to serialize it, make a dozen sequels. My point being stop making weak stories that go nowhere. "

i would like a pricing system like that in GTA5\\world of warship (i mean without the massive micro transactions).  
where you can buy the cheap stuff relative easy with less than 10 hours of playtime but you have to grind a decent amount of hours for the more expensive ships. 50-100 hours for a big ships like the constellation, and like 100-250 hours for the capital ships like the hammerhead.

but in the end this diceision is not on us but on Robert and the developers, i just want a fun game where the grind isn't that bad that it will kill the game before launch.

"&gt;What role can women have in the general church assembly? Can they pray, prophesy, or preach in the general assembly? Can they do those things in mixed gender small groups? Can they do those things in family settings? How does a wife spiritually lead her family while still submitting to the headship of her husband? 

It's my opinion that churches should teach everyone how to discern how God is leading them. I have experienced times when I have felt God leading me to share something specific with someone, whether male, female or in a group setting. Some people would describe this as the spiritual gift of prophecy. A lot of this depends on how you define these things. I think if we each focus on what God wants ""me"" to do we get better results then when we start trying to decide what God is calling someone else to do. 

If a husband and wife are both Christian then it shouldn't be difficult for her to lead and submit. If they agree on priorities and values then they will probably agree on 80% of things and submission in those areas will be shown as general respect towards her husband. It's the areas where there is disagreement that causes tension in this regard."

"I am signed up to be an organ donor. The idea of being able to leave a last few major contributions to the world outweighs my natural instinct to cringe and eww.

That said, my brother once pointed out that there is a roundabout form of bias that this could create in the medical field (especially if you had a healthcare system that doesn‚Äôt focus on individuals among other random factors). He said it better, but there basically is a point at which a doctor could be influenced to not go for last ditch efforts to save someone and simply focus on maintaining organs quality. Even more so when it‚Äôs, say, a random drifter vs knowing you could save 10 other lives with transplants. And such. I AM FULLY aware of how grim that is to even wonder, but it is understandable and frankly quite possible if one day in the future if laws and standards get out of hand. 

TLDR I‚Äôm glad it isn‚Äôt mandatory to be a donor because of how little the system would have to change to be abused for a ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù. But I think a donor system always being voluntary matters to keep things sane."

In one of these occurrences, the explosive killed two people who were in the front seats. People can freak out about anything throw on their cars, and then trying to get out the vehicle or something else, possibly causing accidents. When you see anyone throwing trash out from their cars and you're recording it, i'd recommend sending the footage to the police."

"&gt;You're the one who brought morality into it by arguing that it would've been wrong for him to not tell her because that would have been lying.

Actually, I just simply stated that withholding is lying by omission. I choose to have honesty be the bedrock of my relationships and I understand not everyone sees it that way. Unlike what others have been doing in this thread, it isn't a moral condemnation, it's just my observation.

&gt;As for the Nazi example (not analogy), it was meant to demonstrate that lying isn't always wrong. 

Yes, obviously lying isn't always wrong. Obviously when were talking about literal life and death, lying is a good idea. That is still a very poor example given this is not even close to a life or death situation.

&gt;Also, I'm not this dude's therapist.

Yeah, you're just his judge. Like most people in r/relationships.

&gt;I don't think that OP did anything wrong at all, and I think that what her friend did was insanely selfish. 

I don't think the OP did anything wrong either. And also, he didn't do anything wrong. Sharing your feelings isnt selfish and to claim otherwise just highlights how little our society tolerates someone's emotions when it isn't convenient. 

&gt;At best, he chose to tell her knowing that it would dampen her happiness over her upcoming wedding so that he could get it off his chest. At worst, he was hoping that she'd dump her fianc√© for him.

"I remember hearing from Jordan Peterson that if you gave someone a perfect existence, all the resources they need, all the mates, shelter, etc, along with no conflict, no competition... people (though, especially women it seems) will tend to want to destroy this. Destroy it, to get some sort of conflict going. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's hardwired that we need *something* to strive against. Not everyone has the discipline, even with a proper upbringing with a mother and father, to take on a craft and simply strive to perfect it.

""Listen &amp; Believe"" is a means of creating conflict within the West, by attempting to override the rights of males because a female accused them of something.

This isn't new, it's been going on for a long time (everyone cites Emmett Till and similar stories in the past, but that is not going far back enough really, and involves race which is unnecessary though amusing with the progressive stack nonsense). It used to be kept somewhat in check, especially before the industrial revolution when it was more clear what roles men and women both played (and no, women were not oppressed, not anymore than men were, though you could argue men were due to getting levied into armies by their lord, or conscripted) and both had **responsibilities**.

We've removed expected **responsibilities** from women over time, while giving them rights to be equals of men.. but men still have the burden of their own responsibilities **and** those involving women.

The mistake was giving women rights, while not keeping intact the responsibilities expected of them. I'm going to get a lot of shit for this (mainly the first part), but elective abortion has become a means of evading responsibility. So has the way alimony and child support laws work. How domestic violence laws work. It goes on for awhile. Abortions will still happen if made illegal, which is why I oppose proscribing them. But there's been a drive to remove the shame of abortions (but not a drive to tell people to maybe have less sex, maybe to settle down instead of going out and having a lot of meaningless sex..), and men have no recourse until ""artificial wombs"" become an actual thing.

tl;dr women have been given many privileges and rights, little to no responsibilities, and the loudest advocates are lashing out to create conflict since their demands have actually been largely met, and are .. bored, or something."

Organisms do not have goals, at least not in the sense you are using the term. People have goals as they are thinking reasoning beings capable of setting goals for themselves. But you aren't using it in that sense I think, but maybe a little bit you are?

An organism does not have abstract over arching goals. Nor do organisms have a purpose. Organisms just are. Mating and producing offspring are not goals that organisms pursue, they are just things that they do.

Saying that organism have goals means that there is a purpose and direction driving all life that simply does not exist. Life just **is**.

&gt;This is supported by the theory of evolution and can be seen throughout pretty much all plants and animals.

Can you please provide evidence of this? An evolutionary biologist stating it plainly perhaps?

&gt;So, if having offspring is a primal instinct that is pre-programmed into our brains from birth, and if people who are gay were born like that (Common acceptance is that being gay isn‚Äôt a choice); then something must have gone wrong while the brain was developing to make them seek the same sex as themselves

Are you claiming the homosexual people never have a desire to procreate or raise children?

&gt;Homosexuality is not defined as a mental disorder, but for the reasons above it definitely should be.

Tell us everything you know about the classification of mental disorders please.

"If you were given a net of $1,000,000 after taxes, is it feasible to retire and live the rest of of your life off of that amount?

We've all heard it before: ""If I had a million dollars I would do X"". But with inflation and cost of living, would it be possible to live a typical middle-class American lifestyle without having to work?

If you make $50,000 a year, that's only 10 years worth of salary. With that in mind I'm guessing you would have to invest to live off of returns. Would the returns be enough to maintain the lifestyle? I'm genuinely curious.

"For SPY

* STO 10/26 267c (IV 38%) for -$2.40

* BTO 10/29 $267c (IV 27%) for $2.82 
* Total debit is $0.42

That short leg is going to quickly lose value if IV contracts, and also from time decay. You can't really calculate the exact profit range because it's a horizontal spread, but the options profit calculator ballparks that you'll profit if SPY stays between about $261 and $275.

This afternoon I bought a MSFT $105 calendar. 

* STO this week's $105c (80% IV) for $2.74
* BTO Jan 2019 $105c (27% IV) for $5.84. 
* Net debit was $310.

Ideally this week's expires worthless and I'm left with the January $105 for half price. 

If MSFT went too far ITM I would lose some money, but it would have had to blow past $115 I estimate - and even then, I would only lose a portion of my money, because I still would have a long call ITM. Ideally the one I sold this week expires worthless, and now I have the January call for half price that I can sell covered calls against for a few weeks.

All you're trying to do is find short dated options with high premiums that you can sell, then finding later dated options at the same strike that will retain more value. You're selling that sweet, sweet premium, but you don't need any collateral since both legs are ITM/OTM together. "

"Whose property the laptop is doesn't really enter into the equation, nor does the fact that these kids are minors.  If the software is running off-hours and is capable of turning on the webcam, there had better be a damned good accounting system built into it.

Remote control means a method of communication with the laptop user that isn't going to have a log or other record.

Pandas also are not really good betta tankmates due to temperature incompatibility issues. From [Seriouslyfish](https://www.seriouslyfish.com/species/corydoras-panda/):

&gt; Temperature: Wild fish prefer lower temperatures but tank-bred specimens are happy over the range 72 to 77¬∞F (22 to 25¬∞C). It won't do well if kept in warmer water than this long-term, with the likelihood its lifespan will be reduced considerably.

Bettas should be kept at 78-82F, which is why this is a problematic stocking.

It is, however, it can get into a real gray area because playboy is traditionally called porn graphic material, but there's so much on Netflix and such that shows as much sexually charged material, nudity, both female and male, etc. That is not considered pornography.

"I'm not talking about roster construction being the same thing, but the IR works 95% the same as the NFL and you are acting like its way different. IMO the only flaw with IR leagues is what you mentioned that a guy that is ""out"" can go on IR. That is one thing I agree needs fixed. But as far as people actually on IR I think it makes a ton of sense, because then you don't have to change your team to account for a long term injury, just like in the real NFL. 

I do think leagues shouldn't have unlimited IR or even many IR spots. 1-3 IR spots I think is realistic. I would bet if you looked at your league rosters almost every team has a few players that are actually IR that are players they want to keep. When leagues have a ton of IR spots yes it becomes cheap because anytime you have an injury you dump a guy into IR and can just take a bunch of flyers and hope someone hits.

One more if you really have such a deep league like you are saying that doesn't need IR spots, the waiver wire is probably a bunch of long shots, its not like people are hogging players that have a real shot at being fantasy relevant, they are liekly holding people that are practice squad guys, or last on the depth chart."

Anytime you tell someone certain things are off limits, you just create an echo chamber. Homophobes/racists/whatever bigot isn't going to change their mind because you tell them they can't talk about it in X location. What that is though is discriminatory against certain (even vile and atrocious) legal speech. By championing 'safe places', it starts to segregate a community and treats people like children. Instead of allowing bad ideas to come forth and then striking them down, it allows them to foster and gain popularity because they can't be challenged publicly since they're never brought up in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Also both sides do this shit all the time. Some far right conservatives complain about this, but then any disagreement in /r/The_Donald gets a ban. The same thing happens in /r/LateStageCapitalism. You correct a factual inaccuracy in something says and suddenly you're attacking them because they want to exist in an echo chamber. This doesn't just apply to politics, this applies to any tribe/group. Google (and even worse, Facebook) even does this to an extent by customizing your search results for you. Based on your account and history/browsing habits, you can see different results from the same search than your neighbor.

&amp;#x200B;

Encouraging bubbles is counter to every major human development. Throughout histories nations rose and fell as scientific and trade powers partly based on allowing the unadulterated flow of information and exchanging of ideas. If you need any proof, look at small nations like the Netherlands.

&amp;#x200B;

If someone wants a safe space, it should be mutually agreed upon by everyone. If I want to have a club about RC Airplanes, it's perfectly reasonable to say no politics, X, Y, or Z discussion is going to be had - we're a group focused on RC Airplanes and not anything else. But to have a communal space where everyone has paid into have speech restrictions other than what is codified by existing law, that's completely wrong."

The comment above is a child comment to act as a conclusion to a larger argument (the parent comment) that I don't believe Nazi's were ever actually socialists! Do people genuinely not like the conclusion to my point or did they not notice that it's the same person posting both comments?

Theres this group of gang banger with Godzilla health.
My buddy dominates once he gets them. And he can normally get one every game. I end up killing most of them.
For hardcore they have way to much health. It takes one bullet for them to drop someone so the fact that they can just 180 someone while getting up after being shot is a bit insane for hardcore.

Seeing that they look like actual players it's probably been throwing people off.
They literally take 90+ bullets with the vapr and HC2 attachment. 

It could really be dropped down half way for hardcore seeing that unless you have extended mags or scavenger equipt you wont even have enough ammo to kill one.

I'm still not sure how well explosives work om them. 
But still with bullets alone.
Insane.

WARNING *without warning*
"Some general tips. 

It is a business you are starting. Treat it like a job, like an investment, like you would if you were selling any other thing. 

You need a large social media following first. Build a following before you ever sell anything so that you already have a pool of potential customers. 

Watermark ALL your content.

Sell thru your own personal website and have your social media linked to it. You can use sites that are set up for selling this stuff already but you will have higher profit in the long run if you stay private. 

Do not send free pics thru instant messenger and do not send private samples. Have about 10-20 pics on your social media to create followers and pique interest. 

Do NOT engage in instant messaging unless you have an interested person ready to buy, in which case YOU message them. 
But optimally, you want a set-up where you do not need to interact in private messaging at all to complete the sale. 
For example- you post about what you are selling on your social media- have an interest piquing photo, a description of what is being sold, and a link to your website where they can buy the package. They buy and enter email, you then either have an automatic system set up that emails them the link to download your pics, or you email them yourself. No instant messaging needed. 
If you enjoy the Instant messaging thing, you can always offer it to customers who have already purchased from you. Or you can even have them pay you a fee for naughty fetish chat. 


It's a numbers game. About 90% of your followers are NOT going to be interested in buying anything and are just looking for free one on one attention or are actually thinking you like them if you private message. Then once you ask them to buy they get offended because they only wanted someone to make them feel special (nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't help your business). This is why you should not IM. It is a waste of time from a business perspective and frankly all you will be doing is inadvertently helping creeps jack-off to your responses to their foot fetish questions. 
Once you have customers, you definitely want to make them feel special. I'm not saying be mean to dudes, I'm just saying don't fall for the Instant messaging thing. 


You will be hunted by sharks. Sharks are people who will tell you they can help you with your business, they either steal your photos for their own websites where they already have customers of their own, or they basically become an online pimp. 
 This is not to say that business managers in the foot industry are all fake, just that, like any business, you want to go with proven, professional individuals with solid references. A good tip here is that true professionals will be willing to communicate by email or by phone (instant messaging is almost always a red flag in this business) and will act professional. They do not need to preview or judge your photos before they decide to work with you because they are business folk, they need to know your business goals. You will need to pay them and they will have set fees instead of taking percentages of your sales or doing it for free. 

Because it is an online business, learning how to market digital content online and how to use social media from any other type of online business will teach you what to do with selling foot pics online.

"My wife left me and our 6 year old son about a year and a half ago to chase pills and alcohol.  No one knows where she is or frankly if she is even alive.  It's been a long hard road and we continue to move forward - some things I've learned along this journey.

* Find time to take care of yourself.  Carve out even a little time (30 minutes) to read, exercise, meditate, whatever is your thing.  You have a lot on your plate and your mind and body need nourishment.  
* It's ok to feel sad, overwhelmed, exhausted and it's even OK to cry about it.  Letting your emotions out is important.
* Don't dwell on things that are out of your control.  Both our wives sickness are things we can not fix or change.  When these thoughts enter your brain focus instead on the things you can control like being the best parent for your son.  Even small things like ... ok i'm going to make a good dinner or go to the park with him.
* Be aware of catastrophic thoughts, recognize them, and squash them.  They will sneak up on you and consume you.  Things like how much damage is this going to do my son will keep you up at night.  
* Ask for help from your support group.  I found that so many folks are willing to help me and want to help me but they would never proactively reach out.  This is only cause everyone is so busy and focused on their daily lives they forget.  A simple text for a favor was always taken care of.
* Focus on getting through 1 day at a time or maybe a week and be proud when you do.  Don't look out into the future, it will only worry and stress you out.
* Make lists!  Lists of things that need to get done helps keep you focused and your mind busy.  It also feels great to cross things off of it.

Recognize that working through hard things make us grow.  So - glass half full -  with my situation I'm a significantly better parent and person than I was before this all went down.  Your son needs you more than ever right now ... be strong but understand it's ok to feel weak.  "

You shouldn't have to grind to exalted on multiple factions to play a race you also have to pay $50 to even access.  That's ridiculous.

"Topic: Literal vs metaphorical bible

Your own view on the matter: just collection of fictional oral traditions


Support for your own view: you feel literal = problematic, metaphorical problematic and moderate = problematic. You feel best approach is to only accept archeological evidence. 

So your position is that the bible is fiction. This is supported by *your perceptions of it being problematic* no matter how *you* read it. 


&gt; How do you decide where to draw the line between literal and metaphorical? 


I use my brain. I know bible books are not arranged chronologically but grouped accordingly to their genre. I know some of those genres are poetry, prophecy and apocalyptic. Generally these would not require a strict literal interpretation. You‚Äôre going to have to do some homework. I know a Gospel is a very specific genre of literature that is not expected to read like our contemporary expectations of a historical biography written today. 


So that basically leaves Judaism‚Äôs history (Joshua ‚Äì Ester) and Paul‚Äôs letters. I mean I understand that‚Äôs extremely general but my point is a discerning bible reader is just going to have to apply themselves. Modern authors dummy it down so much and literally hold the readers hand ‚Äì but ancient literature just isn‚Äôt going to do that. To expect to not have to do some homework is just being lazy.


I mean c‚Äômon, when Jesus said he‚Äôd make disciples ‚Äúfishers of men‚Äù any reasonable person knows he didn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôd be literally throwing throw nets over people and setting hooks in their jaw. Jesus didn‚Äôt literally want disciples catching men in nets and hooks. 


The rest of you questions would take more room than an online comment forum would allow.

"Depends on your belief system. Here's my recent experience: I manifested passing my driving test on the first try, with the exact amount of points that I passingly thought/decided I would get. I was quite anxious and had lots of negative thinking regarding the driving test, added to the fact that I usually have a lack of motor coordination regarding this kind of motor skills. From a strictly materialist, mind-does-not-affect-matter-except-though-your-subconcious-influencing-your-actions viewpoint, it was the fact that I had a) taken driving lessons instensively everyday and thus developed skill b) was anxious and took care to drive carefully during the test c) during one of the early lessons, I heard another instructor comment to my instructor that ""your student is a good driver"" which means I already had some skill which makes passing a logical thing. Yet, how did I end up passing with the exact amount of points I decided to get? From a materialist viewpoint it was probably my subconscious that influenced my mistakes and hence the number of points I got, and there was no divine providence acting to influence events type of bullshit; and from a mind-affects-matter perspective it was probably the opposite case. Who knows man. I'm probably leaning towards the latter perspective, because I struck the kerb early on in the test and thought I had incurred 10 demerit points (less than 20 to pass) and had just drastically reduced my chances of passing, but it turned out to be 4 points. I had thought it was 10 points when in a previous evaluation lesson I also struck the kerb and thought I saw the mistake as worth 10 points on the evaluation sheet. Who the heck knows man. At least I passed."

"I think it's different, which I why I also think Christian extremism should be separated as well. I doubt there are a bunch of Islamic extremists voting for right-wing parties in the US, and there are right-wingers who are secular. To mash religious fundamentalism in with all right-wing based extremism is ignoring key differences in reason and ideological motivation. 

It'd be like saying someone who kills for gay rights (not saying it's realistic ofc) being in the same measured group as someone who kills for communism. Yes, they may be considered more left-leaning issues, but their reasoning and motivations are completely different and the LGBTerrorist may be an ANCAP while the Communist is a Che fanboy who wants to kill the gays. 

Just as in this case, someone who kills for religious extremism is different who kills because they hate brown people. Both are stupid assholes, but for different reasons which is kinda the point of studies like this."

A quote I was happy to come across, something that resonates with me, and maybe with someone else too.

"I play against a local that plays this team somewhat frequently so here is my thoughts. 

The key that I've found is to play patiently and try to use assist/cross combo to extend pressure. Either character can convert almost any hit into big damage so its important not to play recklessly. It is important to know which buttons you can press and still be safe on pushblock because that is an easy way for them to get free damage. They can only open you up well with cross combo otherwise you can just crouch block because Yuzu's teleport are reactable and even punishable if they don't cover it with assist and if they cover it with assist they lose meter that they could be using on cross-combo. Yuzu's teleport can even be dp'd, super'd, jabbed out, or anti-aired by certain characters if they are getting predictable with their teleports. As for the cross combo mix-ups its kind of prediction/player based as a teleport into 50/50 off of a swap/not swap isn't really reactable in my experience so thats definitely what you want to try to avoid (not that you easily can)

Yuzu doesn't really provide Gordeau with anything so special so just play against him like you normally would

Sorry for the wall of text, I just play against the team alot "

"&gt; It's purely a cost issue. A carbon sequestration device must be built in a factory. A tree builds itself by you sticking a seed in the ground. The appropriate comparison would be to measure how much carbon you can remove with one sequestration device, find out how much that device costs, figure out how many seeds you can buy for that cost, and compare against that many trees. I suspect I know the answer.

When considering the cost of a single carbon capture device vs. 1000 trees, you also have to consider the cost of the patch of land needed to plant those 1000 trees at a spacing large enough they won't block each other's light, which has climate and soil conditions that will allow them to grow; and you'd also want to figure out the total amount of land that would be needed to plant enough trees to remove all the excess CO2 that's already gone into the atmosphere past pre-industrial levels (plus the additional amount that's likely to get created before we transition away from fossil fuels, even in an optimistic scenario where we start to make substantial progress on this quickly), and whether there's enough available land that isn't already reserved for crops or human habitation (or isn't already tree-covered). You might find for example that the first 50% of what's needed could be done on cheap land, but the next 50% would be much more expensive because you'd have to reclaim land for forests that's currently being used for other things, or because you'd have to change the soil conditions. 

I also found [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/opinion/to-save-the-planet-dont-plant-trees.html) which mentions some potential problems from using trees to counteract global warming, from the fact that outside the tropics their albedo-lowering effect may outweigh their CO2-removing effect in terms of temperature, and the ""volatile organic compounds"" they release which apparently combine with other chemicals in the air to produce methane.

Finally, on the cost of artificial carbon capture devices, I think it's worth considering that the full automation of the manufacturing process is something that may well occur before 2050, and if so that would likely dramatically bring down the production costs of any mass-produced item, maybe down to barely more than the raw materials and energy that go into it for reasons I outline [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/5se2qf/a_futurist_view_of_the_welfare_state/ddfc4oy/)."

Nobody in Ohio cared about Alabama, nobody in Georgia cared about Notre Dame, nobody in California cared about Texas. A down year was just that, a down year. There was no playoff to miss. 

Now everyone cares about the national title and the playoff. You have to win the division to get to the conference title game, have to win the conference title game to get to the playoff, have to win the playoff to get the title. Anything else is a disappointment. Nobody cares about B1G titles for their own sake, everyone at OSU compares themselves to Bama and everyone at Bama compares themselves to Clemson and it's just a massive arms race. You see this in every facet of the game... Wisconsin fans who don't see Minnesota as a rival because those games don't impact the playoff chances of either team instead of leaning into the tradition and the natural rivalry between two close schools, etc. 

And you see this in the NBAesque desire to fire coaches who ""underperform"" by not always winning everything. "

"I was born in the early 90s but the fact that I haven't sat down at watched all 10 seasons of Friends and 9 seasons of Seinfeld in my adulthood apparently make me a bad person depending on who you ask. There's so many references in our current culture that stem from those shows that people don't realise and I would have no idea. 

However, I have a friend who had never seen Mean Girls (the movie) until last year and she finally got around to watching it and she said all of a sudden she understood so many references that she never did before. We don't even realise how much slang and culture is shaped by the media we watch. "

"In the Second Battle of Fallujah, a buddy of mine was leader of a Marine Assaultmen section, basically explosives specialists with modern bazookas (SMAW).

If someone was taking serious fire from a building, rather than storm it they'd call up the SMAW gunners, who'd developed a technique of blowing a hole in the side of a building and then shooting a rocket through it to damage a load-bearing wall and collapse the building on itself. Just safer than trying to storm it with riflemen."

I'm sure the Akkad's killing the ending of H20 probably had a lot to do with her frustration. But I have always considered H20 to be the official end of the original series. Resurrection isn't really canon to me, most of the time I forget it even exists."

What I replied with:

"&gt; I'm actually surprised how there haven't been more no confidence motions in the UK and Canada though. Given that if a PM's party controls 52% of the seats, you only need 2% of your own party to hate you in order to oust you, I'm wondering why it hasn't happened as much as you'd think it would.

The UK, when it passed its [Fixed-terms Parliament Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011) in 2011, actually made it a lot harder for the PM to lose the confidence of Parliament:

&gt; According to the political scientist Colin Talbot, the Act makes minority governments much more stable than in the past: events that previously might have forced a government out of power‚Äîsuch as loss of supply, defeat of a Queen's Speech or other important legislation, or a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister rather than the government as a whole‚Äîcannot formally do so.

Also, the UK and Canada, because they both have first-past-the-post systems despite having more than two parties, tend to wind up with one party getting a plurality of the vote but a supermajority of seats, as the other parties compete with each other for votes.

So for instance, in 2015 the Tories got 36.9% of the vote and 50.7% of the seats. In 2005, Labour got 35.2% of the vote and 54.9% of the seats. In Canada in 2015, the Liberals got 39.5% of the votes and 54.4% of the seats, etc, etc. So there's added incentive not to risk a new election because a small shift to the other party, giving them a small edge, will be amplified significantly in the number of seats changing hands."

"Not exactly the same situation BUT my aunt tried to do this to my grandmother.

Quick backstory, my aunt (the youngest) ""doesn't believe in nursing homes"" apparently the *eldest* daughter should take her parents in and nurse their last years.

My. Grandmother had several Strokes but could remain at home. With care, care that my eldest aunt provided Monday through Friday. On the weekends granma went to a retirement home. Where her doctors met her, assessed her, her hair was done, her nails were done.... Routine maintenance and socialising happened basically.

Youngest aunt had a shit fit and took a FLIGHT from one side of Canada to the other to set big sis straight. She attempted to sign out grandma and bring her home. Grandma didn't know what day it was and though t it was Monday and therefore time to go home so she agreed and became distressed when the nurses said she couldn't leave yet.

The result was an attempted kidnapping charge for youngest aunt.

Now, I gather you're in the states, but abducting a geriatric with the intention of taking her across state lines to abandon her in a place she has nobody to care for her (SIL hasn't told you when she's doing this so you realistically could be on vacation, on a weekend away, on a work trip, etc) is elder abuse and kidnapping. The nursing home is her guardian, if they knowingly hand your MIL over to someone who isn't going to care for her to the best standard available then they are liable. So make sure it's in writing that they would be Knowingly endangering your MIL by letting SIL sign her out and that you will press charges if your MIL is brought to you while they are supposed to be handling her care. Any evidence you have that SIL claims to be doing this is forwarded preemptively to your lawyer And the police in both areas."

I fear China will deeply regret this strategy.  They had a very small extremest fringe in Xingjiang and they will create a large one with funding.  Someone in the Chinese government must actually feel these camps will work.  The people stay for (months? years?) and come out good citizens.  I doubt  it.  These factories will create unrest on an industrial scale and China's cost will continue to skyrocket now with the world watching.  Will they keep people in there forever?  Not only do they have the cost of keeping them but the lost benefits of their labours in the country.  I fear they are creating their own cancer within their country and they will deeply regret it.

"Hey. 

So I did some fiddling around and basically YYC-NBO afford you a ton of opportunities since you have an MPM of approx 13,753 between yyc and NBO. With Aeroplan you‚Äôre allowed 2 stopovers plus your destination (farthest point) or replace a stopover with an open jaw. Stopovers are greater than 24h. You can also add many layovers along the way under 24h. I believe the max is 16 segments. 

You could do the following to maximize your trip:

1) Yyc-add-nbo via Asia with multiple layovers in Asia 1/2 if you wish. 

For example:

Yyc-hnd-tpe-hkg-sgn-sin-add-nbo = 13,638

2) return via Europe 

For example:

Nbo-add-ist-arn-vie-fco-muc-zhr-bru-ord-lax-yyc = 13,689

So to answer your question, yes you can definitely squeeze a European trip in addition to your ADD and NBO trip or even an Asia trip too.  You‚Äôd only be allowed 1 more stopover besides your ADD and NBO. 

My above examples are kinda crazy but that gives you a general idea

"Where did the weapons and civil war come from? I want Iran to not be artificially held down by sanctions, I want Iranians to prosper without being slaves to western interests. Arguably the best thing to come out of the revolution is Iran being a fully independent country again, not some client-state to the US. Maybe I'm naive but I believe if the US were to just fuck off and pretend Iran doesn't exist, things would start progressing in a good direction. Do you not think that if the threat of sanctions and invasion were to be lifted, that Iran's politics would calm down and actually focus on internal issues? 

By the way, I don't know if you've actually ever set foot in Iran in the past 30 years but Iranians are not being ""brainwashed"". Everyone has satellite TV, VPNs, friends in the west, etc. Everyone knows the government is full of shit. "

Tree(3) is [this..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P6DWAwwViU)

[Big O notation](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)

As an example of the scale of these:

Big O of N when N = 10 is 10.

Big O of N^2 when N = 10 is 100. 

Big O of N^N when N = 10 is 10000000000.

I have no clue what the Big O of Tree(N) is, but it sounds ridiculous. Tree(1) = 1, Tree(2) = 3, Tree(3) = a number so large, large numbers are tiny in comparison. Which would be needed to determine Big O of N^Tree(3).

[Big O Cheatsheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/) 

I can only think that I can imagine Tree(57) (which means I can't actually imagine it, it's just too big, like the entire universe, which is what I'm imagining it's size is.. or maybe it's all the atoms in the universe.. I'm probably only imagingine the universe as the milky way, which is in fact kinda tiny compared to the rest of the place..)."

"The offside rule states you are offside if there are less than two players from the other team between you and the goal and you are involved in the play / interfering with the defenders in a way that grants your team the advantage. Normally, you don't think of it as having to be 2 players because the keeper is behind the last defender. In this case, the keeper is ahead of the last defender, so had the ball been played in a way that Kane had an effect on the play, offside would have been the correct call. As it is, the defender marking Kane had no way to react to the play in the time when Kane was considered offside so the decision that Kane was impacting the play in an offside position is ludicrous, even though he was technically in an offside position."

"There are definitely times where I've wondered what it would be like to be on a traditional college campus, but I haven't regretted choosing a non-traditional campus so far. It's definitely a different experience, but there are benefits to being able to walk out of your dorm at 2 AM and grab food from a restaurant, and NYC obviously provides a multitude of experiences. 

Food situation dining hall wise is terrible IMO. We have 19 dining halls in total I think (a few are in brooklyn though) and it's not very good. I can't think of any restaurants that allow us to eat with our meal plan other than an NYU specific location called 18 Below. The good news is that the city provides us with plenty of alternative food options; bad news is that that costs a lot of money -_-'

The vast majority of buildings are centered around WSP, so it's a bit of a walk for me (15 minutes) because my dorm is far away. That being said, if you lived in one of the dorms near campus (Weinstein, Goddard, Lipton, etc.) it would be around a 5 minute walk in most cases. Not a big hassle at all."

Of course, these people are right to the extent that they oppose civilization and the technology on which it is based.

In this way the system has successfully deflected the rebellious impulses of the left into channels that are harmless to the system.

"I agree. However, you cant prove a negative, you can only really present an alternative. With the god question, I think there are few alternatives that wouldnt fall under the category of god for most. In a way, its god or nothing. (Though that could be argued I think you get my point) The longer we go *without* evidence of god, it weakens the claim of its existence and the lack of evidence grows because time passes. We're adding on century after century with continually no evidence. Essentially, the claim is acquiring more lack.

There being no god is inherently impossible to prove, as there is no evidence for the absence of god outside of the lack of evidence for anything else. That lack is seen within all theistic claims, which strengthens the opposing side of atheism."

"The girl showed huge faith into Christianity. I'm Catholic and I knew some of the protestant church believers can be a bit too zealous in my point of view, but I just took it as her trait. She was basically one of those people who talk stuff like praise god from this, praise god from that, and I had no problem with that.

After we decided to go on a date one of my friend told me he saw this bat shit crazy girl singing gospels whilst she was walking on the street. Turns out that was my gf at that time. I told him 'maybe she has faith more than others' and decided to not mind too much.

After a few days later she talked about how her situation is, saying that she is currently living in a dressing room from her friend's apartment, and is thinking about studying more about God by applying for a graduate school of theology. She added that she will get full support and a dorm to live in so she doesn't have to live in her friend's dress room. Do bear in mind that she was attending a very, very prestigious university with a promising major, and was trying to apply for a theology school that I have never heard of. At this point I had to ask what she was going to do after when she graduates, but she basically had no thoughts about the future, not even trying to be a pastor, she just wants to study about God. At this point I had to admit it was way out of my borderline of acceptance, but I thought I could change her thoughts before it gets too late.

A week later we were hanging out in a hamburger joint, and her parents called. She yelled and poured anger at them for not being supportive to her beliefs. I tried to calm her down but she was pretty angry at that time. She also talked about how people around her, even the people who goes to the church with her was against her decisions and she was pretty upset about that. I asked her if she wanted to be a pastor, or a professor of Christian theology and she said no, she just wanted to study about God more. At that moment I realized she wasn't herself but merely a zealot of God, and a very, very bad one, and she was ruining her life because of that.

After a few days later of failed conversations trying to convince her out, I finally decided not to contact her anymore. I am seriously hoping she is okay though, she was a very kind and a nice girl with a soft, but a strong will heart.

tl;dr Had an overzealous gf in the past, I tried to accept her difference, but it started to affect my life also so I had to leave her."

"At level 120 I felt like I was a shell of my former self. I got no new ability at level 120. This is the first expansion that classes didnt get anything new across the board. The azerite traits, which are new to this expansion, dont do what my artifacts traits, from legion, did. In legion a lot of traits had a significant change to how I was able to do my rotation or use defensives. Azerite traits are almost all passive proc effects. 

Also, nobody wanted another artifact power grind. Now, it's even worse because when we get a new piece of azerite gear, we need to grind even more artifact power to just unlock the same traits that we had on our lower item level piece of gear. At least in legion, we had an end in sight. At least until like patch 7.2, I think, when they added an infinitely leveling trait.

The availability of azerite gear is also absolute rubbish. 

Class balance is absolute rubbish. A 95th percentile shadow priest was on par with a 45th beast master hunter I think? Idk that's another meme that was golden. 

I main a blood death knight so I've been paying attention to the tank balance. Right now blood is the most used tank in dungeons by a long shot. They're strong, in comparison. I feel weaker than I was in legion but still pretty ok. Warriors and druids are in a bad spot with warriors being not even playable at high levels. So, instead of buffing and fixing the tanks that are nearly useless. They are nerfing the tanks that are just in an ok place.

Devs are taking a very dismissive outlook to real concerns. Players are just getting tired. They basically said, ""You don't know what you're talking about. Wait till you see what this becomes."" They used the term ""grand scheme"" which became a meme.

Content that they really hyped up at blizzcon ended up being mindless, almost afk trash that isnt worth grinding currently. 

At least they were smart and released the raid quickly. If they made me wait as long as I had to in WoD I probably would have stopped playing by now.

Oh they also didnt remove mythic plus that's a pretty shitty decision.

At the end of the day I love the gameplay of wow.
As long as they put out patches as often as legion did I'll still love it.

Also, I can't convince my girlfriend to try final fantasy. I came so close to quitting when I found out yall had ff5 and 6 raid bosses. I did really enjoy vanilla realm reborn!

"Round 1 is difficult for the thing if he's successfully contained in the US.  Reagan will order no research on the thing until the creation of a deep geological laboratory with dead man switches on every researcher down there that will collapse the only entrance to the  laboratory if any of them flatlines. Researchers will be given extensive physicals before being put in the laboratory but one will suffer a stroke and die due to an undetectable congenital vascular defect in his brain, launching a worthy sequel to the original The Thing. The researchers will attempt to use The Thing's physical strength to make a tunnel to escape their containment while the thing attempts to assimilate every one of them in the process.

Round 2 the thing wins hands down. The entire expedition is assimilated by the time they reach Buenos Aires. Once at a major population center the things split up send envoys to other cities and the whole world is assimilated before anyone knows what is going on.

Round 3 Trump brags to the world that the US has the best aliens via twitter and threatens to weaponize the thing to unleash fire and fury against North Korea. Russian hackers find the location of the thing and  Russian sleeper agents attempt to steal it leading to their assimilation and the eventual death of all mankind.

Round 4 Trump says he prefers scientists that weren't dismembered and the thing is left in Antarctica. It assimilates all the penguins and then attacks the next research vessel to study the sexual habits of penguins. The crew scuttles the ship and broadcasts never to go to Antarctica. The US nukes Antarctica and we all live happily ever after."

The clue is right in the term ""anarchy"" itself. ""An"" meaning against, and ""archy"" representing a social stacking order, like in the word Hierarchy. 

What this means is that anarchists believe that people are generally good, and that we don't need rulers to be good to one another, and have a symbiotic relationship. An ecosystem. 

And that's the important distinction: anarchy is a philosophy of no **rulers**, not one of no **rules**.  There are rules. You're good to one another. Anarchists typically believe in the social organism to sort out its problems.

There are a lot of really intelligent people who call themselves anarchists and lay out the philosophy in a way that might shock people who carry this misconception that anarchy is about chaos. Noam Chomsky is a great one to start with, [here's a great introduction he wrote. ](https://chomsky.info/state01/). "

"Throwaway here.

I am about 90 percent obsession, 10 percent compulsion. 

My obsessions are rough because they concern things about my health or how I am.

For a long time I was convinced I was going to develop fibromyalgia. I would get weird psychosomatic pains that would convince me that it was happening. I thought I had diabetes for awhile. I worry constantly about cancer. I have had a pap, colpo and cone biopsy; a colonoscopy; an endoscopy; two moles removed under suspicion of skin cancer; a breast ultrasound; and a thyroid ultrasound all within the last couple years. I am sometimes certain I am giving myself cancer.

The worst things are the mental aspects, though.

I spent months convinced I was schizophrenic. It was all I could think about. I even started hearing voices. The only reason I was able to let go of this is because it all completely went away when I was occupied with things or spending time with others. It only happened when I was alone in my apartment.

The most horrible was when I found our I was pregnant. I became obsessed with the idea that I was a pedophile. I had been abused as a child, after all. I would have horrible and repulsive thoughts enter my head unbidden and they would make me want to vomit. Why would I be having thoughts like this if i wasnt a pedophile?

Turns out, that's just the disease. The real turning point came when someone asked me whether the thoughts turned me on.

""Of course not,"" I answered. They're disgusting and make me feel like a terrible person. They said that if I was actually a pedo, the thoughts would be enjoyable even if they did make me feel bad. 


Once I had my daughter, I was very busy settling into my role as a new mom. I had made a plan that if I ever had a temptation like that, I would put the baby in the crib, call my sister to come stay with her, and then check myself into a nearby psychiatric hospital.

But the thoughts never came. In fact, I largely forgot about them. Even the dozen or so times I've had to use diaper cream on her or wipe poop out of her in the last year and a half, it hasnt been any different than putting neosporin on my arm or wiping my own butt 

In other words, it was all in my head.

I sat and cried and freaked out and felt disgusting and lived in fear for something that was never actually real in the first place.

None of it was real.

I mean, I'm glad. But still. FUCK this disease."

"He can do it in plain sight. One of his phones is a a normal iPhone like any of us could go buy. He has two other iPhones that have been modified to be more secure. Presumably, these phones are [pretty locked down](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/us/politics/trump-phone-security.html):

&gt;President Barack Obama was careful with cellphones, too. He used an iPhone in his second term, but it could not make calls and could receive email only from a special address that was given to a select group of staff members and intimates. It had no camera or microphone and could not be used to download apps at will. Texting was forbidden because there was no way to collect and store the messages, as required by the Presidential Records Act.

Trump hangs on to the unsecured phone because it lets him store his contacts, and the other ones don't. He can do whatever he wants with it. It's possible, and even likely, that there are no official records of what he does with this phone.

As a side note, my personal hunch is that keeping his personal contacts could well be related to the emoluments clause issues."

Like I said, I‚Äôm very new to this so I thought your module would be good for me to follow as a little primer. I think it‚Äôs a very good starting point to get things rolling for a campaign!

One thing I added was a shift change of guards, where 4 came in and replaced the guards that were there. I just wanted the players to know that there were 4 guards, but they followed one of the guards going back to his apartment and beat some information out of him.

"As for number 2 - the ATX version of Pro 4 has 6 SATA ports, 2 of which are getting disabled. And it's not a big deal, if you don't want more than 4 sata devices connected (or 3, in the mATX version).

I would have stuck to ATX format board if you're getting a full ATX case, for looks if nothing else. 

If you don't like ATX Pro 4 for some reason (or are worried by that single bad rating on pcpp - which is obviously bullshit, the ports are not reinforced like on some higher mobos, but they're not ""weak"" either and it takes a lot of stupidly applied strength to rip a pcie slot off the board), get this one: https://pcpartpicker.com/product/gMQG3C/gigabyte-b450-aorus-elite-atx-AM4-motherboard-b450-aorus-elite or basically anything in full ATX factor, to take full advantage of the case. Of course, if you insist on mATX it will fit as well, there will be just some gap between the bottom of the mobo and the psu shroud. 

As for your edit about monitor resolution, 1440p@144Hz is the sweet spot for 1080, the card is not really capable of doing 4K@60Hz consistently, unless it's an older/less demanding game or you're fine with going down to medium/low settings and even that might not be enough to have constant 60 in some games (the new AC games will drop below that even on the lowest settings in native 4K without resolution scaling on). 1440p@144Hz is also rarely doable in big, heavy AAA games, but you can lock to 60 (or 80, or 100, depending on the game) and still play fluidly at the native resolution and still be able to use 144Hz in less demanding titles. Or you could grab a gsync monitor, but those come at a premium price (it's really nice though). "

"You're right in that parking will be needed, but 1000 stalls for 2 blocks of mid-rise is probably excessive.

Most residents will need parking, but for a place that's walkable, most homes (though not all) won't need more than 1 car. If in the apartment building there are a handful of car-free homes, many 1-car homes, and some 2-car homes, that probably won't be anything close to 1000. I'd have a better idea if I knew how many homes are being built.

Some parking for nonresidents is also necessary (some workers and visitors will be coming from auto-dependent parts of town and from out of town), but nonresident parking will tend to generate many car journeys into and out from this complex (the cars won't be staying parked for as long), so the concerns about traffic we're reading in this thread are very much valid. I'm also concerned about walkability (people walking and high volumes of car traffic don't mix well) and affordability (parking garages are expensive)."

&gt;	A 2017 report by The Nation Institute and Center for Investigative Reporting looked at the terrorist incidents in the US between 2008 and 2016.[7] It found:[8]

&gt;	- 115 right-wing inspired terror incidents. 35% of these were foiled (meaning no attack happened) and 29% resulted in fatalities. These terror incidents caused 79 deaths.
     
    - 63 Islamist inspired terror incidents. 76% of these were foiled (meaning no attack happened) and 13% resulted in fatalities. These terror incidents caused 90 deaths.

&gt;	- 19 incidents inspired by left-wing ideologies (including eco-terrorism). 20% of these were foiled (meaning no attack happened) and 10% resulted in fatalities. These terror incidents caused 7 deaths."

"There are several ways to acquire bitcoin anonymously if that is the objective. I'm not from the EU so I don't know the specific laws and environment, but I do know decentralized p2p exchanges exist all over the world. No one can stop two individuals from trading assets. 

Here in the US buying bitcoin is pretty straight forward. However buying and using cryptocurrencies anonymously isn't so straightforward. For us, it's not illegal to buy bitcoin so you can link your bank account no problem. Its definitely easier and cheaper to buy bitcoin with a bank account on a verified exchange account, but not anonymous. Localbitcoins, ATMs, and p2p, or sell a good or service fir bitcoin are all ways you can acquire bitcoin anonymously. 

Say you do link a bank account and make the initial purchase, but want to anonymize those bitcoins before you make a purchase so those BTC cant be linked back to you. Once you have BTC you can create an unverified exchange account without KYC/AML, (for smaller amount. Poloniex was $1,000 or 2 BTC/day). Send the BTac to the unverified exchange account and place a margin trade to buy Monero. (Store Monero) or buy back BTC and send those anonymous BTC wherever you want. "

State rep Rex Duncan of Ohio is concerned about the ‚Äúbarrage‚Äù of Muslim immigrants coming into the US to support Sharia law. However, the US already recognizes sharia law. You can read about it here: 

https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129731015

In fact, the US has recognized religious law for some time. However, just like the author of the previous article describes, this law is not governing but is instead voluntary. Here‚Äôs a pew article about religious courts in the US: 

http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/08/applying-gods-law-religious-courts-and-mediation-in-the-us/

Here‚Äôs the website of a tribunal court that helps settle disputes between families under sharia law by request. They operate separate from the government and under US law: 

https://www.islamictribunal.org

When the US experienced heavy catholic and Jewish immigration, there was never any consideration of their religious laws becoming a part of the actual governing system. The same goes for the millions of Muslim immigrants in the US, and those that have yet to come.  

Regardless, the first amendment prohibits any laws being passed with respect to any religious establishment. Thomas Jefferson was thinking about this long before us. 

So I wonder then why you fear the implementation of sharia law, because even if a wave of Muslim immigrants were to come one next twenty to thirty years that support sharia law, they would never see it come it govern this nation in any way. Unless of course they can manage to alter the first amendment.

"So you would contend that the skull shape deliberately selected for in brachy breeds does not cause pugs (and other breeds, not just picking on pugs) to be prone to breathing issues and other related health problems?  Because pretty much the entirety of the veterinary community disagrees‚Äîand there have been peer reviewed studies that support this.  Even if a pug is health tested up the wazoo, the fact is that due to the shape of its skull, it‚Äôs going to more prone to issues than a dog with a more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù shaped face.

Also, just because a breeder is a show breeder does not mean that their dogs will be free from health issues.  For example, cancer in flat coat retrievers (a breed where you have few, if any backyard breeders), MVD in Cavaliers, and DCM in Dobermans.  You certainly have a MUCH better chance of getting a healthy dog from a reputable breeder, but that doesn‚Äôt make those dogs immune from genetic diseases."

Who else would it be tho? 
"1. I would argue that a strict hierarchy isnt actually needed to teach. It's easier to think of education or training as a transaction I think. Teachers have knowledge and skills that are useful. People want those knowledge and skills and therefore offer whatever in exchange to learn those skills. 

Sure one party has the desired possession, but that's hardly different from going and purchasing food from someone that made it. No one would argue the cook is at the top of the hierarchy. 

Age is a factor to be sure, and in relation to your family question I do think there are valid forms of hierarchy inside a family unit. But those same forms if hierarchy are observable in numerous other animals, making them perhaps just a constant in family group construction. Packs need an alpha. That's just biology. 

2. I personally think a parent owns their child until which point the child is capable of claiming themselves from the parent. Though that relationship should be far from a draconian, tyrannical one. In my personal opinion. 

3. This part would be quite large where I to really go into it, but Marxism is quite incompatible with anarchy. Something established by Proudhon at the very beginning of anarchy and communism. Lenenists are called tankies as a reference to the authoritarian aspect of the ideology and usage of heavy armor to enforce the rule of the communist government. 

I personally find communism just as bad as facism. Opposite sides of the same coin. Both are extremely authoritarian and demand a singular world view. Essentially the same base concept with different economic trappings. At the bottom though its join or die. 

Not to mention that leftist economic policies almost always fail anyways on top of the authoritarian aspect. 

4. Yes. A million times yes. I would in fact argue that anarcho communism is an oxymoron. Communism is about group rule, anarchy denies all forms of ruler ship. You simply cant have a communist system without some form of leadership. 

No a commune is different. But communism has almost nothing to do with the idea of a commune. 

5. There a lot of different schools of anarchy each with different ideas on this. I think it should function as a form of penal mutual aid. Basically say someone robs you. That makes them a risk to the community. Therefore the community has interest in preventing more robberies and protecting themselves. Therefore they have an interest in finding who robbed you and preventing that behaviour in the future. 

Something like community policing. One thing I think all anarchists agree on though is no prisons. 

Personally I think murders should be killed by the family or friends of the victim. Rapists should be killed or castrated by the friends or family of the victim. 

Basically the same way issues are handled on the street. Like if you have someone steal some weight off you then you dont go to the cops. You find out where they stay at and roll up with the homies. 

6. Proudhon, Smith, Stirner, Neitzche, and Tucker are all good authors to read. "

The Furai model kit version of Prime, despite having wheels, triggers images of some kind of spacecraft for me.

"Hardly a representative sample size. Giro Manoyan (Bureau) has been very outspoken on LGBT issues, and the backlash AYF got for their statements is already pretty well known. 

Hai Tahd is a simple concept that doesn't waste words, of course you're not going to find the concept of LGBT rights written down because that was hardly a thought during the days of Kristapor Rosdom and Zavarian. But what's been central to Hai Tahd is ""hayabahbanoom,"" or all-out measures for the preservation of Armenians (which we get critiqued for all the time). To that end, the ARF didn't ask in Syria if people were gay or not, Hunchak or Ramkavar, or any other identification based question to organize self-defense measures. Likewise in Artsakh in 1988, and similarly in 1994. And even if they did, it's not as if they'd say ""oh no, God hates gay people - you go straight to the frontlines and play musical chairs on a minefield."" All that really matters is organizing and acting for the preservation of innocent Armenians whenever they come under danger--that's the essence of Hai Tahd. 

But really, don't take my word for it. Here is Bureau discussing Hai Tahd and it's relation to LGBT issues

I disagree with this point.  We don't owe them anything.

Dogs were specifically bred and adapted to express traits that we react emotionally to. The fact that we care more about dogs (generally) than chickens, is due to our genetic disposition to give value to these artificially-selected attributes of dogs.  

That is to say, we selected for these traits in dogs because we value said traits on a personal level, compared to a chicken, which we select for egg production or meat."

"I received my first skill point as a player last week and came to the same conclusion.

If your goal is to raise the skills you already have (and get that coveted second +4 at the earliest opportunity), you need to *save your first skill point*.  Once you have two skill points, you can lift your rightmost +1 skill on top of your rightmost +2 skill (and then probably swap them.)  And then a third skill point lets you hop from +3 to +4.

If you make the ""mistake"" of spending your first skill point on a new skill at +1, it is going to take you a total of four skill points to get a second +4.

I wouldn't give my players a hard time about rearranging their pyramid as long as they end up with something that they could have achieved with proper planning.  I don't want them to be unhappy with their character design.

I do wonder, though... is switching from pyramid to columns really the best way for advancement?  I kind of like the way the pyramid structure creates focus, and keeping track of unspent points feels weird.  Another approach would be to give characters a new skill (slot) with the restriction that they keep each tier smaller than the one below it.  (Isn't that how Fate's predecessors did it?)  That way they'd have to take a +1 skill first, then a +2 skill, then +3, +4, and finally +5 around the time you'd have a Major Milestone.  You might need to dial down the Significant Milestones if you don't want them to ""level up"" too quickly."

 A ideia do ato em Salvador, de acordo com o presidente do PT da Bahia, Everaldo Anuncia√ß√£o, √© que Haddad circule em cima de uma caminhonete, pr√≥ximo do povo, **[como aconteceu h√° tr√™s semanas em Feira de Santana, segundo maior munic√≠pio baiano, na caminhada que encerrou oficialmente o primeiro turno da campanha do PT este ano](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,campanha-de-haddad-muda-agenda-para-barrar-avanco-de-bolsonaro-no-nordeste,70002534116)**.

 O percurso da manifesta√ß√£o pol√≠tica, desta vez, ser√° entre Ondina e o Farol da Barra, com concentra√ß√£o no monumento conhecido como Gordinhas. Na chegada ao Farol, principal ponto tur√≠stico da capital baiana, artistas, intelectuais e movimentos sociais se reunir√£o em um movimento p√∫blico batizado de ""Ato em Defesa da Democracia, da Vida e pela Paz"".

 Com isso, o PT pretende vender a imagem de que existe um clima de virada da candidatura de Haddad sobre a de Bolsonaro, que **[lidera as pesquisas de inten√ß√£o de votos com folga](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,ibope-bolsonaro-tem-57-dos-votos-validos-e-haddad-43,70002560490)**. O crescimento do ex-prefeito de S√£o Paulo no **[√∫ltimo levantamento *Ibope/Estado/TV Globo*](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,ibope-bolsonaro-tem-57-dos-votos-validos-e-haddad-43,70002560490)**, ainda que tenha sido somente uma oscila√ß√£o dentro da margem de erro, ser√° utilizado pela sigla para dar for√ßa a essa narrativa, explicou o ex-presidente do PT baiano e articulador da agenda de campanha de Haddad no Nordeste, Jonas Paulo.

 A a√ß√£o, segundo ele, mira atingir o p√∫blico nordestino beneficiado pelas gest√µes petistas e ampliar a vota√ß√£o do candidato do partido ao Pal√°cio do Planalto na regi√£o ‚Äì barrando o avan√ßo de Bolsonaro nesse universo de eleitores, que apesar de ser tradicionalmente identificado com o ex-presidente **[Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/lula-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva)**, condenado pela **[Opera√ß√£o Lava Jato](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/Opera%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Lava%20Jato)** e preso em Curitiba (PR), n√£o vota em qualquer candidato indicado pelo PT.

 **[No primeiro turno, Haddad atingiu 60% dos votos no Nordeste](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,mapa-eleitoral-do-primeiro-turno-mostra-pt-cercado-no-nordeste,70002538004)**, √≠ndice abaixo dos que foram obtidos por **[Dilma Rousseff](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/Dilma%20Rousseff)** (PT) na sua campanha √† reelei√ß√£o em 2014, quando a ent√£o presidente petista teve 73% dos votos.

 √çndices atingidos pelos governadores bem-sucedidos da legenda este ano, como o reeleito da Bahia **[Rui Costa](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/Rui%20Costa)**, que obteve 75% dos sufr√°gios v√°lidos no primeiro turno das **[elei√ß√µes 2018](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/elei%C3%A7%C3%B5es%202018)**, tamb√©m est√£o sendo usados pelo partido como meta para o desempenho da campanha presidencial de Haddad neste segundo turno no Nordeste.

 ""Nosso objetivo √© ampliar essa margem de vantagem de votos e reduzir a absten√ß√£o, que chegou pr√≥ximo de 30%, principalmente em cidades como Salvador"", explicou Jonas Paulo.

 Em reuni√µes internas e materiais de orienta√ß√£o distribu√≠dos para lideran√ßas pol√≠ticas, dirigentes estaduais do PT t√™m pedido √† sua milit√¢ncia que fa√ßa uma ofensiva sobre esses votos nulos, brancos, indecisos, mas principalmente sobre os eleitores que dizem que n√£o v√£o √†s urnas no pr√≥ximo domingo, 28 de outubro, por decep√ß√£o com a pol√≠tica.

 O objetivo √© pregar que, apesar da decep√ß√£o com os casos de corrup√ß√£o envolvendo os partidos pol√≠ticos, em especial n√≥s nos governos petistas, a democracia est√° amea√ßada com a elei√ß√£o de Jair Bolsonaro e, por isso, n√£o ir votar seria um ato irrespons√°vel.

 Seguindo essa l√≥gica, o governador Rui Costa foi flagrado em √°udio, enviado para prefeitos baianos aliados pelo WhatsApp, orientando que eleitores fossem transportados at√© as zonas eleitorais no dia da elei√ß√£o. **[Na grava√ß√£o, divulgada pelo Estado, Costa afirmava que era preciso reduzir a absten√ß√£o durante o segundo turno](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,em-audio-rui-costa-sugere-que-prefeitos-transportem-eleitores-para-votar,70002557988) **das **[elei√ß√µes 2018](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/elei%C3%A7%C3%B5es%202018)**.

 Em nota enviada √† imprensa no mesmo dia, o governo baiano alegou que o √°udio foi adulterado. Em seguida, contudo, confirmou que a mensagem existiu mas alegou que o petista n√£o pedia voto para nenhum candidato √† **Presid√™ncia**.

 Costa, por√©m, √© um dos principais conselheiros da campanha de Fernando Haddad, desde o primeiro turno, e fiador de um discurso mais ao centro e moderado do presidenci√°vel petista.

 *Diferentemente do que informou a primeira vers√£o deste texto, o ato de encerramento da campanha de Fernando Haddad (PT) ser√° em S√£o Paulo, no s√°bado, e n√£o em Salvador (BA). *

""" **CJCJ:** Both us and Chiefs have improved a heaps this season. ""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not totally convinced. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chiefs struggled to look as cohesive this season compared to last. I actually think Torsos and Drippay struggled to trust Kamii to fit in and it took pretty much the whole season for Kamii to be able to show his stuff. Hopefully they stick together as a roster and find that cohesion, because on paper they should still be the #1 team in OCE.

&amp;#x200B;

It could be that all teams in OCE have closed the gap on Chiefs to make Chiefs look more beatable, even though they only lost less than a handful of games in the regular season and only lost to TM. Their wins were less comprehensive that in the past. But if you look at what the casters and analysts said week in and week out about Chiefs' form there were always comments about flaws having crept in. In that context TM being the Chiefs killers is possibly less meaningful than what casual observers who didn't watch every week of OCE league play might think.

&amp;#x200B;

EG is also a better team this RLCS than last. I give TM a 50/50 chance of beating EG. I have a hard time seeing Chiefs beating PSG. Maybe PSG in week 1 or 2 of league play. But regionals PSG, odds are PSG will win.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be proven wrong and to be shown that OCE 1&amp;2 at least equal NA/EU 2 or 3. But I won't be surprised if OCE under-performs compared to last RLCS. OCE needs to become more internally competitive to be able to keep pace with NA/EU, otherwise it'll start to fall behind. Having a 2nd division, and now effectively a 3rd division in NA/EU will have the effect of these regions pulling ahead of all other regions. OCE and SAM need a viable 2nd division semi-pro competition pretty much mirroring RLRS if they want to be competitive at RLCS long term."

"Everything you just said is demonstrably wrong. The majority of democratic voters were pro gay marriage before the Supreme Court case, however LEADING democrats would not take the stand because they wanted to court centrist swing voters who may disagree. And Democrats belive in the party platform https://democrats.org/about/party-platform/. Which focuses mainly on workers right issues supporting small businesses and reigning in big business and making meaningful immigration reform. Where as globalists are for open boarders, not for the benifit of the people but for the businesses, they want a globe spanning capitalistic model centered arround the USA. See basically the dems want the government to help the little guy, the republicans want the government to leave everyone alone so they candecide what is best for themselves, and globalists want to extract economic benefits for themselves on the backs of humanity and this will make the world better because there will be more cool shit but international conglomerates will own everything.

"I see the cuties in there ! Very nice set up for a larger dragon with a good uvb. For a tiny baby it can be overwhelming. But you must get the right uvb ASAP. Those guys won't be able to get enough uvb through the screen and at those distances. I raised many clutches of babies when I had breeding pairs, it's really best to start them out in a smaller [ shorter ] tank that is slightly less cluttered where they can find food easily and the uvb can reach them. 


These guys can and do bite each other, not really out of aggression but because they are voracious eaters and the toes + tails of their siblings look like food. When you see beardies with missing feet + bitten tails, that is why.

So be thinking about setting them up in their own tanks soon. In the meantime, order 1/4"" crickets 1,000 at a time from a company like Great Lakes hornworm or Millbrook. Babies eat a oad of crickets + do best with at least 2 feedings per day. Never feed them crickets that are larger than the distance between their eyes or they can suffer a terrible impaction which can lead to partial paralysis + at times even death. "

And it's virtually impossible - we've now had ""sleuths"", super lawyer Zellner and others trying to come up with a plausible alternative theory and... nothing. Zilch. There's sinkblood.

"I switched going into 3rd year, the first 2 years of the programs were identical at my school and they let us switch with no hassle at that point if we wanted.

Didn't have trouble with programming just didn't find it as interesting as circuits.  Be careful where you end up in EE though depending on what you're doing there's going to be a lot of programming or very programming-like things there too.   MATLAB, simulation scripts, verilog, testing code and on and on.  From system design to block design to verification to testing there's code at almost every step of the way because it makes everything so much faster and more repeatable.

It might not be so bad depending on what you don't like about programming.  In 1st year we learned like 5 different sorting algorithms it was very tedious and not that useful really.  If the general nature of it (breaking down a problem into steps, sequencing things, assigning values to variables, doing a bit of math) really puts you off then yeah you need to be careful where you end up.

There are still lots jobs light on programming/scripting though for example the IC layout guys need to understand a bit about how the circuits work but I don't see them coding at all."

Create a device that is more of an extension and add-on to the Xbox, that can also function as a smartphone. Not the other way around. Same for the surface: create a device that acts to augment the experience of the Surface. "

I guess that makes sense. I'm just finding that I'm significantly less frustrated trying to do things on rope. I tried climbing the silks for six months before an instructor was like hey let's try the rope and now I can scuttle up and down the rope multiple times a class. I still slide off the silks though. I feel as though it's a grip strength issue. I suppose I'm at the mercy of whatever the people at the gym are willing to teach me.

"I think Monk 18 rogue 2 is best

Splitting monk levels low limits your ki points and fist damage pretty severely. I think you will be very unhappy if you are stuck with 6 ki points all game. 

 Monk 18 gives your empty body as capstone, fitting its the best monk power. You also get the other good stuff on the way, perfect self etc.

Rogue 2 gives you expertise and cunning action, which is all you need. Go stealth and perception and you are the sneakiest best trapfinder ever. 1d6 sneak attack aint bad either "

"There are some flaws in his ""research"".

1. We don't know how many people he tried this on that went ""lolnope"" and stated that it was in fact a deal breaker.
2. I didn't see any method to determine how many unwitting participants assumed he was trolling versus those who thought he was serious.
3. I don't think this experiment determined how many women played along to be polite and not confrontational but never followed through on any arrangements to get together.
4. How many of these women will overlook these things for casual sex but would not tolerate it in a relationship, assuming any of them took it seriously?
5. How many of these women were just looking for a hookup versus an actual relationship?
6. Getting like 8 women out of the thousands using Tinder to suggest they're okay with racism or misogyny isn't a sufficient sample size to determine any sort of trend, no matter what you tell yourself to the contrary.

I think it's an interesting observation that bears more research, but I mean everybody knows that when you're looking to hook up looks and attraction are going to be the biggest factor. Nobody denies that, everybody knows it. But this experiment hardly justifies the self-loathing might as well end it all now histrionics incels like to wallow and circle-jerk in."
