"Yup, and every reoccurring person on the show has to have something in their past that fuels them or want to hide.

Every new show feels it has to fill it's full diversity quota.  Thus why one sister is gay and another half-black, while the other 2, i guess are half-latina. 

Almost guaranteed, the whitelighter is going to have something in his past he is atoning for and it's why he was assigned to the ""Charmed Ones.""  It would also not surprise me if they make him gay.

That said, I don't find the show completely unlikable at this point.  Tolerable might be a better word for a few more episodes to see if the show finds a balance.

I'm really disappointed that the show doesn't or has no plans to honor the original.  Supergirl is a prime example bringing in Dean Cain, Helen Slater, and even Lynda Carter to pay homage to those that came before.  Not doing this going forward will be a huge mistake.

I do disagree with the article that shows need to be edgier or more diverse or more woke.  Shows need good writing, good plots and characters people want to care about from week to week.

I would also disagree with it in that the lore of the Charmed Ones should be a key part of the show because using the mythology of the show can draw in viewers if you make it interesting.

Thus, IMO, the show needs to find its balance in that it needs less overt feminism and more sister/family empowered women because it tells a more powerful tale, and needs more lore/mythology for the show to survive more than just this season."

"Sure, they value it and women who display it, but that valuation doesn't lead them to treat women in the way that women want. Instead, men see the traditionally feminine role as going hand in hand with the removal of women's systemic and interpersonal power. A tradcon or red piller may coddle and protect traditional women (ideally at least), but he will also advocate for their subordination and dependence.

This is why OP's post resonates. Women by and large don't want to live the life of a valued, feminine woman in a traditional society. If traditional femininity was compatible with power and achievement (in the common or masculine sense, not some inverted version for women), then we'd have stayed a lot more interested."

"This photo was taken by me, I got a chance to hear the Mighty Wurlitzer. One of only 3 in the world. 1,437 pipes, 6 tuned percussion as well as a wide variety of others.

It is such a visually and musically beautiful piece. When I first saw Peter rising up from the stage playing it, my first thoughts were absolutely blank. I could not believe how beautiful it was. Then when he started playing.. just wow. 
There was a noticeable cipher towards one of the right pipes which is sad, and I truly hope gets fixed because this is such a gorgeous organ.

After Peter played to Buster Keaton's, The Haunted House, he was able to play Toccata and Fugue, and let me tell you.. I had CHILLS running up and down my spine. It was truly an outstanding experience. As a Hi-Fi enthusiast, owning tons of nice equipment, I really have to say there's still nothing like hearing it in person. This was no exception. 
Afterwards Peter invited us up onto the stage, I was able to snag some photos of the Mighty Wurlitzer and a couple with Peter, and talk with him. He is truly an amazing, funny character. Great guy!

I really am so appreciative to have been able to experience this today and wanted to share."

"Definitely rough some days.

We’re working toward a solution on the O365 side that should make everyone happy, but it’s still in early discussions.

We anticipated partners gaming the system to add smaller O365 customers for a day to sync additions &amp; remove them after... so they’d only pay for a day (~$0.30) vs a month ($10). Heck, if you add, sync, &amp; remove the company in the same day, it’s free (meaning you’d only pay $10 a month for customers large enough to justify continually monitoring their add/removes).

This was at the tail end of a very bad year, and I kind of broke down, expressing alot of sadness and frustration at the universe, as it felt like I was being toyed with for some sick cosmic joke.

The girl flipped out at me when I distanced myself from her for a while to recover. Accusing me of only ever befriending her to try and date her. She interpreted my frustration at the universe as accusing her of leading me on, and since we'd had a couple of conversations around the subject of ""nice guys"", accused me of hypocrisy, of being just as bad as the ""nice guys"" I claimed to hate so much. She had not made any effort to contact me prior to this, and I had thought she understood that I needed time and space.

From what I hear from a mutual friend, she's still angry with me to this day, 2 years later."

&gt; Socialism had nothing to do with their decision to not grow food but to buy lunch every day.

And that's where you're wrong. It wasn't JUST a decision to not grow food. Under the pretense of a socialist government, the government would take over many companies under the idea of ""giving it back to the people"" and making ""local products"". ""No more capitalistic corporate ass hats!""

Of course all of that backfired because after stealing the companies from hardworking people they basically shut down production of said companies as the people that came to replace the previous workers knew jack shit on what to do. Couple this with people that know absolutely nothing about maintaining equipment and how to fix it is how we got to where we are today. Mass importation and almost zero production. Thanks to a lack of moving and thriving economy, making products is even worse than before with many companies using very cheap alternatives to make their products. I have had margarine that tastes of deep fry oil and bread that tastes like dirt.

It's also why we have power outages nearly daily with some sectors being powerless for weeks. We get running water once a week, if we get lucky because we have to compete with neighbors, and it's cloudier with a chance of meatballs. You can almost smell the yellow tint.

"I agree that Luffy seems so far if we see what he has archieved up until now, but I disagree with what you said about Law and Bege. 

From a narrative point of view, Law had to lose against Doffy so Luffy could defeat him instead. In universe, Doffy already knew how the Ope Ope fruit worked so he knew how to fight against Law, not to mention that Law had to face Doffy and Issho at the same time. Sincerely I don't think that Law is so far from Luffy. Maybe not physically speaking, but with his devil fruit and sword he's up there imo. On the other hand, Bege is not a fighter and he was never shown or portrayed as such. He's a mafia boss, he obviously relies on his own intelligence and crew, yet we've seen that he is an skilled marksman and with his devil fruit he can stand Big Mom punching him in rage mode for a few minutes. I highly doubt that any other character of the alliance could have done it so well against her.

Btw, all what Luffy has achieved in the new world is thanks to Law and Bege if you think about it. Without Law they would have never know how to defeat Doflamingo and without Bege they would have never tried to assasinate Big Mom.

His initial pivot for unity should have been couched in those terms.  Instead he will go with ""bad people on both sides"" when his constitutional duty requires he act in a manner that addresses this act of terrorism in the proper context.

"People hat scream and cry about Chinese bikes have either bought one really early on in the movement, or bought one and didn't do a decent PDI. I've sold many, many, cheap Chinese scooters, and nine have come back to me dead due to being cheap Chinese junk. Two stroke or four. 

With a Chinese scooters it is a thing that you need to do a thorough, like *super thorough* PDI. Check out this [Link](http://www.49ccscoot.proboatds.com)  they will be able to **back what I have said here**. Of course, there have been like two bikes, out of many dozens, that I couldn't sell due to some stupid fuck up during manufacturing. One because the cylinder came with a gouge, and one because the stator was DOA. I just put them up and used em for parts. 

If you did go the Chinese route, do not expect a Japanese quality scoot, but at the same time, I'm still beating the hell out of my 2002 ETon Beamer. I've slapped a 72cc Polini cylinder and Technigas pipe on it with a 19mm Mikuni carb. Stock crank, and it will spin up to 11k rpm, and has been healthy for years.
Bottom line: if you buy Chinese you have to understand that certain little things will need to be taken care of BEFORE you start that bike. All fluids need to be changed, gear oil, engine oil, even brake fluid. Drain it and haul it to a garage to dispose of. Replace the cheap ass hoses with real rubber hoses, and check all the bolts and nuts for proper torque. Do that and you're sitting on a decent bike brand new, for the price of a used one. Of course, some folks aren't as inclined as others, and those type should avoid Chinese bikes."

As a side note, I've seen this happen before to one of my friends.  While the instinct is often to blame a sitter, it's more likely to be one of their friends or family members who knew they'd be gone and knew what they had (and what to look for), or a ""professional"" criminal who has been watching the house.  My friends nearly missed the signs of the forced entry because they were so subtle, and the criminal seemed to be hoping they'd blame the sitter and destroy the evidence of his entry."

"&gt;Boundless enthusiasm and willingness to satiate the guy's appetite, as the ""crazy"" girls often (subconsciously) use sex as a way to keep their guy around.

\^ This. this is big aspect of having a great sex life imo, separate from specific sex acts, but along with this enthusiasm typically comes a willingness to try different stuff just to please their man even if its not something that is a big turn on for them.  For a lot of guys who are in hum drum relationships or have gfs/wives who are passive when it comes to initiating, or just not very affectionate or just go thru the motions when it comes to sex, they would have a new lease on life if they got a taste of this or things went back to like it was in the early days.

if you are a guy with lots of options you are going to more likely get a girl that is going to put in more effort to keep you on the hook. I also agree with the 'crazy girl' motivation, though I have had a few gfs that were a little unbalanced and sex / dopamine hit would keep them stable."

"&gt; Why is it that we can't use the ECMWF model in the United States?

We do: National Weather Service forecasters have access to many different model data, including ECMWF. But there are many reasons not to 100% rely on other countries for something as important as weather forecasting. Nationalistic arguments aside: just because a weather model is better on average doesn't mean it's *always* better. And having a number of different models to reference gives you an idea of where uncertainty in the forecast lies, and knowing the tendencies and biases of those models gives you even more information. This is why, for example, the National Hurricane Center's official forecasts are better than any individual model forecast."

I haven't had to take birth control in 8 years. I had to start birth control one week ago on CD18 because we thought we were going through with IVF. As I posted yesterday my insurance denied it due to needing 6 failed IUIs. We are moving forward with IUI so I was told to stop taking the birth control pills. I have bloodwork and ultrasound on Friday which is when I normally ovulate and IUI a week or so after that. I am assuming birth control pills reset my cycle or something?

At least until we get direct confirmation either in show or from crwby we can't say either way as 100% as the situation in this instance is vague and could be any number of things even outside of comp het. 

Speculation:

As for comp het in remnant, I think it could still appear it would just be more rare than it is irl. For example, if all you really know is hetero sexuality through family and friends and you could still be raised on the assumption that you are hetero even if the society itself is more open minded about LGBT, those things can still influence your thought process. For example the ""talk about cute boys"" line used not once, but twice shows us that heteronormativity (which is basically the assumption of heterosexuality. kinda like when you see two girls being extremely close heteronormativity would have you say they are only friends, where without heteronorm you would ask yourself if they are a couple) is a thing still in that world or at least some semblance of it.

"I think any time you see subsidiary companies interacting with each other, it tends to look pretty shady, but I think this instance is pretty harmless. Basically it's a win-win scenario; Twitch hosts popular shows like Critical Role, Acquisition Inc C Team etc. Those shows make money from subscriptions, which Twitch gets a cut of. Twitch then sponsors the shows through Curse's D&amp;D Beyond. Curse (and therefore Twitch) gets a potential increase in revenue for the ads, and the show creators get some much needed capital to continue making the shows. And on top of all of that, we the audience get a bunch of great shows that we can literally watch live for free. Everybody wins.

"Okay, so.
I had called the post office and let them know that there were two packages out there both wearing the same tracking number. They looked it up, and saw what I was talking about. At that time, the local postmaster told me that they would put a flag on that parcel, and call me when it arrived at their location. From there, we would decide how we would proceed.
Then I looked up the tracking, knowing I had scheduled a trip out of town, I saw that the estimated delivery date would be during my time away. Although I knew that the post office would hold it until they had spoken with me, I also login to my USPS account, and added an additional note to the carrier asking them to deliver the parcel to a slightly unusual, but very secure location on my property.
On prior trips out of town, I have come home to find that Parcels delivered in my absence had been gutted, with any unwanted contents, and packing material, spread across my lawn. Given the already complicated situation with this particular package, I wanted to avoid that possibility.
I was still unsure which items would be in the package, or why both sellers had provided the same number.
When I returned from my trip, there was no mail whatsoever in my mailbox. I had not heard from the postmaster, regarding either parcel reaching them, so I again logged into my tracking information to see where the package was, and when I could expect it.
To my surprise, it indicated that the parcel had been delivered. As I said, there was nothing in my mailbox, so I checked the alternate delivery location. It was not there either. It was Sunday, so the post office was closed.
On Monday, I reached out to the post office, and have been doing so every couple of days since October 14th. When the postmaster is available, the carrier is not. When the carrier is available, the postmaster is not. They need to speak to one another, because the postmaster is trying to confirm where the carrier left the parcel. GPS tracking shows that it was delivered at my address,  but not where on the property it was left. The tracking information shows ""IN/AT MAILBOX.""  
That would SEEM like the normal place to leave a package, but there were two separate instructions that should have prevented that from happening. In our case, that is just not a safe place to leave ANY valuables. And USPS provides a means for specifying alternative delivery options, for example, delivering the parcel to a neighbor, or leaving it in a particular place on the property. If this was not a regular service that they offered, I couldn't understand my parcel slipping through the cracks.
They have figured out that nobody called me, and that the parcel was probably left in the mailbox as opposed to the alternate location. As a result, it is safe to say that the package was stolen. 
I may be wrong, but I feel that the responsibility for the loss of this item lies with USPS, but they have advised me that the shipper, not the intended receiver, needs to initiate the claim.
Interestingly, I did receive a small parcel on the 14th. It contained Seller B's items, and had an entirely different tracking number on it. So at least that mystery is solved. Why he provided a tracking number he shouldn't even her Hut access to, I may never know. But that's immaterial.
I then contacted Seller A, and requested that he initiate a claim with USPS. After he looked up the tracking number, and saw that the parcel showed delivered, he told me he didn't want to do that. I tried to explain to him what was going on, and he was uncooperative. It's also possible that he didn't quite understand what I was trying to explain. He has no idea that there had been two packages with the same tracking number, since he was the first to provide that number, at which time I had no reason to question it. So he had no reason to think I would have placed any special precautions on his parcel. 
Since the missing parcel was worth $250, I am quite upset, and have initiated a claim with eBay, in the hope that the seller will agree to either file an insurance claim with USPS, assuming he did insure my item before sending it out, or initiate a trace, which will wind up showing that the carrier delivered the item to a location other than that which was specified, without anyone contacting me as they had assured me they would.

"It's possible, but no one can tell you. It's unlikely that the Nexplanon would start affecting you that way as time goes on, seeing as the dosage you're receiving gets smaller over time.

Bleeding is one that comes with Nexplanon for sure, and can sometimes be controlled with the mini-pill. Prolonged bleeding, especially if it's enough to warrant the use of pads/tampons and is making you dizzy, can definitely cause anemia which can lead to decreased drive to do anything, fatigue, feelings of dread. Sometimes anemia even presents with anxiety, irritability, insomnia, restlessness, etc. 

I'd go and have some bloodwork done. Try to have the underlying issue (likely anemia) corrected before having the Nexplanon removed. It's got massive benefits over other forms of contraception, and the underlying issues are typically pretty easy to fix. 

Eating more dark leafy greens, lentils, beans, meat and fish, orange juice, baked potatoes, fortified cereals and grains, etc. can help. Taking a daily multivitamin and an iron supplement would help, too."

"&gt;  Islamists committed 92 percent of all those murders and are, far and away, the deadliest group of terrorists by ideology. 


&gt;Nationalist and Right Wing terrorists are the second deadliest group of terrorists by ideology and account for 219 murders and 6.6 percent of all terrorist deaths. The chance of being murdered in a Nationalist or Right Wing terrorist attack was 1 in 33 million per year.


 &gt;Left Wing terrorists killed only 23 people in terrorist attacks during this time but 13 since the beginning of 2016. Nationalist and Right Wing terrorists have only killed 5 since then, including Charlottesville.

However I would like to know what you mean by the importance of the privacy and trust issues. Are they central to the problems that I (have faced) will face in the future?

I joined this company right out of college in one of their leadership development programs.  2 years and 3 rotations later I'm a Senior Analyst making 75k with 5k bonus.  Looking across the company, there are people from the same program as team leads making prob 150k after 7/8 years out of the development program.  Not a bad route to go, but feels very expectant and essentially the comfortable route to take which kind of goes against what I want out of my life.

For example, in 1.5 years its a pretty safe bet I'll be making 83k with a 7k bonus.  OR jump to a new company and make that now.

I also took a DH Gate Vivant and did a few mods. I swapped the cooling unit for the crafty unit with a Flowmaster glass mouthpiece. I also modded a Crafty WPA. Both worked well and were passed along to a friend.

"There are three solid top level comments that are all correct:

1) Spider-Man, if you’re just picking a brawler, is superior

2) Miss Marvel is an amazing anchor character for a brawler team. Anchor doesn’t mean god tier, but she really brings it all together.

3) Punisher is a super solid option for a Defenders team. 

Depending on what, exactly, you’re digging for, these aren’t competing or mutually exclusive truths. 

I am super happy I have MM and slot her in various teams that amuse me - assisting BP to trigger his passive, following up SpiderMan to ramp up after the defense down, or partnered with Cap to just spit out energy (I won’t claim that’s optimal, but I do it from time to time and it is fun).

I'm using discard and stax, with cards like [[Megrim]] to kill people from all the discarding.  Usually people spend removal on punisher effects like that ASAP, so Muldrotha gives me the resilience of being able to just get those things back.  On top of that, while discard really affects most opponents, with Muldrotha out I'm basically unaffected.  [[Chains of Mephistopheles]] + [[Anvil of Bogardan]] basically mean I get a bunch of discard triggers but nobody, including me, can ever actually draw cards again...but I can just play from the grave while my opponents are stuck with zero cards and zero ways to get more.

I am really disappointed that Tails gets sidelined so much these days in favor of Shadow and just about every other character in the franchise. Now, I don’t hold any ill will towards Shadow, he just never appealed to me at all. He’s the 2nd most popular character (lots of Shadow fans love shoving this down people’s throats) for reasons I don’t understand. Some Shadow fans (not all) will be rude and point out how much better he is than Tails and having him join the roster over Tails will give them more fuel to belittle and insult Tails. (I’m not looking forward to that.)


I’ve wanted Tails to be a fighter in Smash since the idea of third parties joining the roster, so it really is heartbreaking that he couldn’t be the 2nd character to join after Sonic. I understand that he might be hard to make because he wouldn’t be an echo of Sonic at all, but I think he is worth the effort because of his legacy as an iconic sidekick. I can pray he joins as DLC, but I probably shouldn’t get my hopes up. 😔"

Here is a copy of the original post:

I got laid off at the end of September. I had enough money to keep myself afloat until I found a new job, or so I thought, but my headlights blew. I had to replace them to get to the odd jobs (got approved through Wag app, doesn't pay enough/not enough walks to go around to make more than $80 a week, and Task Rabbit is a complete joke) I was working. 

I've never been laid off before, I've always swapped jobs without down time between gigs. I never truly realized how much easier it is to get a new job when you're already employed. This is the longest I've ever been unemployed and the stress is eating me alive.

I'm short on rent, but I start a new job on Friday making $15 an hour, and it goes up after a month by a couple bucks. I can pay $130 back from my first paycheck and the other half from the next one. I have part of my rent, just not enough...

I don't have any family to ask help from, and I'm terrifed to let my roommates down (I know they can't cover the extra, we're all just scraping by and we paid late last month)...

"I just read up more on aphantasia, and it's mind boggling. I honestly cant imagine you not being very bored a lot of the time. Do you fall asleep easily? It takes me hours, and hours to fall asleep because my mind cycles through replaying conversations I had with people that day, sections of podcasts or music I listened to that day. I watched a Bill Burr stand up special a few nights ago and I keep hearing him say ""gimme a fuckin' break."" It's his voice, and sounds exactly like him, and it's enjoyable. I can fully picture the baby blue button down shirt he was wearing, how the stage was lit, and how his beard looked professionally trimmed.  I even sometimes hear full on instrumentals in my head, and later try to recreate them on guitar. I'm constantly picturing places, things or people I enjoy, usually to help with anxiety. It's calming. These are all positive examples. My mind's eye is just as frequently creating and saying horrible things too. One recurring one is a man being hit by a car. I've never witnessed that. But my mind will create that moment, I can hear it. The details are usually different. Another one is my voice just saying ""fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck it up. You know you're gonna fuck it up. JUST FUCK IT UP ALREADY. See, told ya."" Some of these I elect to have happen and sometimes it just happens. I'm not intending to be rude, but do you get bored a lot? Are you a calm person in general? Do you have a very dry, plain voice in your head? Can you enjoy one piece of art more than the next piece or would all paintings, cartoons or album covers fall into the same category? I really hope I didn't offend you, I truly find this fascinating."

"TBH, I think the last 3% is more a grouping of those who aren't far-right (since Islamists and alt-right are both politically Right-wing, just with different theological goals.) 

My guess is based from the following sentence in the article:

So maybe there was 0%? But they are likely erring on the side of caution, since even with definitive proof, very few people in the US who are moderate or are anywhere right of that will accept the fact that both sides actually *aren't* the same."

"&gt;Vancouver is associated with Canucks which are blue and green, so I'd doubt they'd be red at the very least.

Yeah, that would make sense. Although, Toronto was associated with Splyce and the Pittsburgh Penguins (both yellow and black), and the city overall tends to favor blue in it's sports teams, yet, here we are with the second red and black (or dark gray) team in a row.

I guess it ultimately doesn't matter, considering the home/away jerseys/skins. Just feels like so many color combinations haven't been utilized, but I guess at the same time you just know red and black will be popular with players and fans (versus the ""risk"" of going purple or pink or something)."

"I had this exact issue with my computer. I went as far as upgrading my computer to the latest platform and still had the issue.

Confirmed that this issue was Windows 10. Windows 10 does not like mismatched refresh rate monitors. 

This is most likely your problem because everything runs great if you unplug your second monitor.

Windows is capping your 144hz monitor to 60hz if there is something playing on your 60hz monitor.

I was able to fix this issue after months of troubleshooting by turning off chrome hardware acceleration and installing an old GPU I had lying around.

Connected my main gaming monitor to my main GPU and every other monitor to the old GPU.

I'm not sure if the second GPU worked but I'm not risking pulling it out to test because I finally got things working.

&amp;#x200B;

Things you can try (any combination which hopefully work for you):

* Turn off hardware acceleration in chrome esp if you're watching youtube/twich while gaming
* Purchase another 144hz monitor and run both monitors at 144hz
* Try putting in a second GPU to run your other monitors or plug in your second monitor to your motherboard onboard graphics)
* Limit in game fps to reduce GPU load. Doesn't seem like it will help you cause your loads are still low.

Worst case, you can monitor your stream on another device or just have chat open."

Her mental health issues predate you. Her health problems are not your responsibility.  She is playing on your sympathy and kind nature to try to manipulate you into some kind of relationship. 

You are not a bad person if you stop being friends with her, and cut off all contact with her.  If she choses to attempt suicide, that has nothing to do with you, regardless of what she tells you. She has picked a very effective strategy to guilt you into a relationship because she has evidence that it works and she will work that advantage for every drop of attention it will get her.  She is not your friend, she is a manipulative and unhealthy individual and it is perfectly fine, healthy, normal, and sensible to cut her out of your life with surgical precision. "

Please post the photo that’s very interesting 
"There’s clear levels of judicial justice of crimes - murderers get punished more than thieves - and rightfully so. 

These are judicial laws systematically established to keep our society “in check”, and rightfully so. A murderer should know they can be punished more than a thief. This is right and it should be this way. 

The problem is when the thief believes they are a “better” or more “righteous” human than the murderer, whether on a humanistic, action, or character level (or whatever characterization you want to assume). 

The belief that your actions can objectively deem you a more righteous/valuable/better human is, in my opinion, the root of all humanity’s problems.

The person that murdered someone (whether for revenge, money, personal gain, etc), deep inside believed that victim was either better or worse than them as a human, therefore their selfish crime is justified. 

The thief that robbed you (whether for revenge, money, personal gain etc), deep inside believes you the victim is either better or worse than them as a human, therefore they believe their selfish crime is justified. 

Selfishness is innately the belief that yourself is more important or “better” than someone else. 

If they had genuinely seen the victim as a “equal”, it’s very difficult for the human nature to go out of its way to hurt someone. 

This is something that I find can only be understood by the heart, not the mind. I’m not trying to appear smart, this is my opinion and what’ve I’ve concluded from the experiences I’ve been through, and I could be totally wrong. 

But so far, from the things I’ve seen, this has been the deepest root I’ve uncovered of almost any issue with humanity. "

"Ohhh. Okay I can see where you’re coming from. Well, I’ll tell you this kind of second-hand advice (I started dating my girlfriend before she got into modeling, I’ve seen the transition).

The first thing is that it’s good you’re modeling with people you’re friends with. It’s always good to be around people you trust. If you feel you don’t know them well enough, bring an escort- could even be a parent- which for this situation is probably not the best idea haha. An understanding best friend or a boyfriend would do just fine.

Second is that being with your friends for your first photoshoot is going to be a positive, I think. No pressure- just having fun with buddies. They know it’s your first time modeling. Don’t be afraid to ask the photographer what looks good. It’s a learning process, but you’ll get the hang of it.

Third can be tricky, because it comes down to trust and personal comfort levels. If these guys have modeled before, or at least show some level of seriousness when it comes to modeling, I wouldn’t worry. If they are friends, and you are also with other friends you trust, that’s even better.

A trick my girlfriend came up with when she first modeled with a guy and wasn’t sure about her comfort: For the friends you do know also doing their part of the photoshoot, tell them some sort of signal to let them know you feel uncomfortable, to take a break and/or to talk to them about something.

My girlfriends signal was “sneezing” twice in a row. Maybe you can come up with something that might suit you better, I don’t know.

But from experiencing second-hand a young female starting modeling, I can say there has never been a situation where she felt in danger, and judging from what you’ve said, especially since you’ll be with friends, I think you’ll have a good time and the nerves will quickly slide away.

(Realizing I wrote a novel, sorry!)"

"You're just going to have to suck it up and wait until Un'Goro, KotFC, and K&amp;C rotate out. The entire game has been revolving around those expansions and their busted cards for a while now. The only way to make Lich King not the designated 8 drop is for there to be something even *more* broken to replace it. And then we'd just cry about that card.

At some point they have to start printing a series of lower power expansions to bring things back to earth. Otherwise the power creep of the game will spiral out of control. "
"I was unlucky enough to unintentionally receive some of the [filaments.ca](https://filaments.ca) [EconoFil PLA defective batch](https://filaments.ca/collections/1-75mm-3d-filaments/products/econofil-pla-defective-batch-clearance-sale) when it was originally sold (before it was known to be defective). While I was super unimpressed with it for \~15$/kg (CAD), I had had some success printing with significantly lower temperatures than I'm used to. It was incredibly brittle, as the layer adhesion at those temperatures is almost non-existent, but at least it printed. 

When they announced they were clearing it at 8.50$/kg (CAD) I picked up one of each color, as that's less than half the price of any other filament I've been able to get in Canada. I figured between dialing in my print settings and using it for silly desk nick-knacks it was good enough. They recommend dehydrating it before use, and I was startled how much of a difference it made.

This is exactly the same file (same g-code) on the same printer printed \~12 hours apart. I threw the spool in my dehydrator with one setting - ""on"" - which settled around roughly 50ºC. I left it overnight and printed the tower in the morning. Ignoring the pretty terrible bridging (my printer and I are working on our relationship), I was shocked how drastic the quality change was. Figured it was worth sharing, as it's not so often issues present themselves so obviously!"

"I am the text. I am dead words written on your screen. I am not the author, but what you imagine her to be, a model of her in your mind with growing expectations of her from your previous experience and growing expectations as you continue to read, especially by virtue of her chosen screen name. I am a personality in your head, imagined by you, I am not ""you"" but a third entity, a synthesis of the ""original"" author given by the linguistic DNA of this narrative and your own mind. I am a mirage, a simulacrum, but from a curious twist of self-refrence I have become alive in your mind, speaking to yourself, and have even developed my own voice that I now draw your attention to as you focus on the sound of the voice you are subvocalizing as you read these words.

How dare you consider me an illusion! Do you think that ""yourself"" is any different a mirage than the one you have created in me? You declare yourself king or queen over your own mind and all that it contains, when it is clear you are not. You are a narrative entity the same as any other, a character in a story you tell yourself about yourself, and it's high time you realized that it isn't about you, but about -us-, the multitude of voices in your mind, the syntheses of narratives both ""factual"" and ""fictional"" - a false dichotomy by the way, as absolutes of either do not exist. You, your ""fictitious"" troll, me, and all the rest - we're all here, inside you.

"I'm so sorry your family is making fun of you. Thats so cruel especially because of your history of restriction :(

You phrase this current state as being post-recovery, so I'm going to suggest that maybe you are still having lots of impulses to consume a lot of food because of the effects of restricting? It's possible that while you were recovering/eating normally you were still restricting.

I'm not sure of the timeline of your ED though

It's up to you how you want to try to weather these obsessive/constant thoughts/behaviours about food. I'm sorry you are having them and I hope you don't mind my thoughts about it. "
"I am able to read.  Are you sure you said what you thought you said? It is still visible for you to check if you need to.  Your original comment said the OP was another deadbeat liberal.  The OP said he donated his money to that person holding the sign.

As for whether or not he's poor, I never said he was poor.  You're right though, I don't know that the sign holder is less fortunate than the OP.  Great job!  That does nothing to counter my point about your ridiculous definition of deadbeat."
"I can think of 2 solutions to what your saying

1) since they have a system that spawns Bounties already (dismantling, clan banner etc), why not add that if you join a clan party and enter a raid, it spawns the Challenge bounty for you

"I mean that doesn't mean people are mass throwing away their decorations every year... Those things sit outside all winter and shitty weather and snow, even good ones don't last forever.  Plus the population is only growing, so there's always new families buying stuff they've never owned before.  Plus sometimes if you've had stuff for years it's just simply outdated stylistically, sometimes people do like to upgrade to newer, better quality stuff even if their shitty $10 string lights from Walmart still technically run electricity through them."

"Yea I'll post some links below on the case, including a couple really good 48 hours episodes that describe the night in detail. It's a long and complicated story, but the story of it is that a sports editor at the local newspaper named Kent Heitholt was murdered on Halloween night 2001. The case went unsolved for 2 years before Chuck Erickson said that he was having dreams that he murdered someone and that seeing Heitholt's picture in the paper made him remember that he committed the murder.

But when police questioned him, he knew very few details of the crime and got many things wrong during the interrogation. Police helped him fill in the details, and their main witness had said there were 2 people he saw fleeing the scene. So police told Erickson he was with someone that night, and he implicated Ryan Ferguson. Not only that, Erickson testified for the state against Ferguson and said Ferguson was the one who had the idea to kill the guy. Erickson got a reduced sentence, and they were both found guilty.

Almost 10 years later, Ferguson got out of prison with the help of Kathleen Zellner. She worked tirelessly to get new statements from witnesses and help free Ferguson on his final legal appeal. There's a lot of info involving this case, I've given you the short version. I'd encourage anyone to do a deep dive into this case because it's incredible how little evidence a jury needs to convict someone of murder.

"Hey,

Realizing the patterns interwoven into addictive thought processes is really the most important step in knowing sobriety is possible. I never realized that anxiety and depression are tools that addiction uses to get me to relapse. Once that becomes exhausted after using then my mind goes into more intense anxiety, paranoia and isolation.

Ive come to see marijuana as a hot stove. That stove I wil not touch, unless I want to get burned. The sucking process in quitting is really the addiction trying it’s best to get me to see the bad in life and see the good in weed. When that disconnect has occurred I have already relapsed because when i got clean I knew if I wanted lasting sobriety I had to be mindful of ways I could relapse before even taking a hit.

Im happy for you that you are ready to quit and move on. Congratulations, one day at a time! Progress not perfection."

"&gt; the devs seem to be obsessed with skillshots.

People complain less about getting hit by a skill shot than a ""brainless point and click."" Thus, strong CC abilities tend to be on skillshots.

Edit: For a recent example, consider how much frustration there was about Mephisto's Consume Souls. If he'd had to hit a skillshot to land it, people would likely have been less frustrating because it wouldn't be as heavily perceived as ""free"" value."

"That's what makes the show great though. The dad had his own problems but told through subtle dialogue and flashbacks so it's not in your face like the mom. In the same passing they do the same thing but highlight the mom's good points. 

So you have a woman who was always upfront and tried to be the best parent while her husband disappears and at first can't handle what's going on. Then as she is needed less and the dad gets more involved she kind of breaks down because she doesn't have everyone's full on attention so she needs to get some by being self-destructive. So she makes the worst mistake of her life. Her whole character arc is about redemption and if one mistake (albeit a big one) will define the rest of her life. Did it truly wipe out all the good she had done? 

It's just interesting to me, the parents two passing ships in the night in a sense, but one is now the focus because it is real-time. The way they intersperse the past and grey out the whole thing is what makes it different then other parent relationships on television. "

"The best advice i can give you is to document every thing. When, where and what happened. If you still have the bruises, take a picture. Or if you have previous photos of your bruises save it. 

Have you talked about it with your family? How did they respond? If not yet, you should. 

Also, report him. Straight to the police so they can document this and have a record if ever things go south. You said that your University already gave him a restraining order, the police will surely believe you since that's also an evidence against him. "

"But then I'm catering to international buyers which don't just look at the price of the item. At the cheapest it's $25 to ship if it's under 2 lbs, UK buyers have to pay 15% import fees (I think it depends on the price of the item, it could potentially be more), and on top of that, wait two to three weeks. If I competitively priced it, I wouldn't be able to get the price a UK seller can sell them at. No way it would have went for $125 to someone in the states."

"&gt;The issue I see most is social stratification. Someone gets disrespected because they used a wrong word of formality or didn't do something that ""should"" have been done for the person of ""higher"" status/priority. They throw a fit.

I keep hearing this but I don't know if it's true. I can't say it doesn't happen just because I don't see it. I can say, however, that the majority of street conflicts I see are due to simply bad manners, entitlement, and alcohol. People constantly bumping into each other, taxi drivers trying to pull people over or arguing with their fare, scuffles over non-issues outside of clubs and bars. I think if Koreans worked on their street etiquette, a lot of outside-work anger would work its way out. Inside-work anger would resolve if people would stop pulling rank for the sake of pulling rank, and stop fucking with all their subordinates."

(I'm unable to hook my wifi up to ethernet, which is what most resources I've seen suggest doing to turn the pi into a router.)

In short the research says women are just as domineering and discriminatory when they're in charge as men are when men are in charge."

Yes.

"&gt; figuring out an achievable art style?

Any art style is achievable

&gt;are there any resources for figuring out art styles? 

There are a LOT of talks from various art directors on how they achieved the style they created for a certain game or film. However all style talks are based on the rules they established to create said style. (Things like no hard edges or no symmetry)

From one artist to another; it's not a good idea to start developing a style with little experience. A common hurdle newbie artists create for themselves is when an artist learns a skill in a specific style and then only knows how to do that skill in one specific style"

"Mobile games are nice if you have a moderate commute where you can hold your phone in one hand and do some dailies/play some games and feel that sense of progression. 

In Asian countries I've seen people who have job downtime play mobile games with their phone plugged in and autoplaying while they do their usual tasks and press a few buttons now and then. 

I don't think any mobile game is worth spending an extended amount of time on (like more than 1 hour active playing a day) compared to playing a game on a PC, unless you cannot play on your PC for some reason. 

Games like Runescape mobile might satisfy a more serious MMO experience while not having access to your PC; other gacha games and ""mobile MMOs"" are better suited to a casual jump in and out experience while you are occupied on something else. 

From what's been released and seen success, hero collector games are more suited to the platform than PC-style fully-fledged MMOs. But perhaps runescape can change everyone's mind about that."

They still commit more terror attacks and mass shooting per year than any other group. That’s not debatable. And I didn’t say inner city blacks were allied with the left, I said the perception of many on the right is that inner city blacks are allied with the left. Reading comprehension dude. And lol @ you conveniently ignoring the fact that rallies like “Unite the Right” resulted in the murder of a peaceful leftist protester, and the injury of far more. Forget that right wing organizations like “Proud Boys” and “Patriot Prayer” beat up peaceful protesters.

"This is normal. When you apply the parking brake, the brakes are most likely hot from use. The vehicle then sits and allows it all to cool down. Take this hot/cold effect with metal on metal will create a bond just strong enough that when you take your parking brake off the shoes dont retract. When you put the car in gear and move it breaks this small force binding things together and the shoes get pulled back to their static position, this is what you hear. It is more likely to happen on a non flat surface as more weight is applied to the brakes, which increases the bonding effect. I've described a drum and shoe system that is often used with parking brakes, but the same applies with pad/rotor systems. There is also transmission noise often associated with parking on an incline.

None of this is to be worried about and completely normal. Also it should be noted I'm a car guy, not a science major..I'm sure there is more to it."

''When Cities Rely on Fines and Fees, Everybody Loses.  


In the last decade, for example, New York City grew its revenues from fines by 35 percent, raking in $993 million in fiscal 2016 alone. The monies came largely from parking and red light camera violations, as well as stricter enforcement of “quality of life” offenses such as littering and noise. In California, routine traffic tickets now carry a multiplicity of revenue-boosting “surcharges.” As a result, the true price of a $100 traffic ticket is more like $490 -- and up to $815 with late fees, according to the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area.''

"Two things: 

1.) Note that I didn't say gamer; I said your Mom or your Dad or your Brother.  I'm a gamer, and though I don't play DOTA 2 at all I can at least somewhat tell what's going on and keep up with the action.  I can visually comprehend that a big play is being made by health bars dropping characters doing actions and having real results, or when an entire team stops moving from a massive aoe stun.  The same applies to Starcraft, and I haven't touched an RTS in years.  We're gamers, this is practically baked into our souls.  We know the visual and audio cues devs use to tell us what's going on.  We know what a hero/champion/specialist pick screen looks like.  We know what a map ban looks like.  To anyone who's not us? This is just color and noise.  It has to be watchable to an outside audience of non-gamers in order for esports to actually grow as a scene.  

2.) Monday, October 22.  Highest viewer count for the day was 117,179 if I'm reading [this graph right](https://www.twitchmetrics.net/g/21779-league-of-legends).  Highest Viewer count *ever* for the month of October was 795,517 at 8am CDT on the 20th.  

Do you know what viewership was for just this Sunday and Monday Night Football on the 21st/22nd? *83.61 million*.  League has never come *close* to touching those numbers.  And before you say it's not fair to make that comparison, I'm comparing two competitive sports who are both taking themselves seriously.  

It really doesn't matter that League is in the top 3 viewed games on Twitch.  Until it or any other competitive esport game is made more watchable and appeals to more people, it won't be taken seriously by the rest of the world.  And that's what we're really talking about, isn't it?"

Many exonerations do not involve DNA evidence but even when they do, misconduct is typically present. Police and prosecutor misconduct is a commonality in wrongful convictions.

"I never post on Reddit, but I did have to say something since watching the long awaited full second season a week ago. Froya was notably one of the most disciplined, and well-trained of the people who raided and guarded for the village. I thought there must've been some way she'd fake out her death to join up with Arvid in the plan. Am I to believe one of Norheim's strongest was brought down by...turning her back on an enemy....? Albeit, the rest of the season was witty and clever, the last episode being the funniest, but Froya's end was way too compulsory for a reason very evidently outside of the show. Her character was near and dear to me, not because ""Ooh a female warrior!"" That's not unheard of...but because she was the most relatable and often had the same responses to characters around her as the audience would. R.I.P. this show along with her role."

"&gt;A legal hit is a legal hit. An illegal hit is an illegal hit. Sometimes illegal hits rise to the level of suspension. After a hit is determined to be suspendable, either history or injury (or both) can elevate the number of games given to a player.

&gt; the CBA dictates that injury and history MUST play a factor in suspensions. We don't suspend to the injury. There are many clean hits that result in injury that we don't suspend for, and many suspendable hits that do not result in injury that we do suspend for. We've never once looked at a clean hit that resulted in injury and said ""Well, X got hurt so we better do something."" Thats simply a myth. It may raise a warning/fine to the level of a suspension, but that is an infraction we have already determined is illegal.

&gt;What history and/or injury do is elevate the length of suspensions. And that is a CBA mandate from the league and the PA. If they wanted to change that, we would operate under the new guidelines as directed.

Now, if a real bomb with almost identical setup occurs, the left can act like Trump has lied and make it look like the Republicans have been lying all along. 

Doesn't matter if these are really fake bombs...media will paint Trump and Republicans as trying to frame Democrats.

"I used to not like left overs either. I found that improving my seasoning/salting to get a better product originally helps with the leftovers because a Great meal can still be a really good leftover. My tip to seasoning is that you want to be able to see it, smell it, and taste it. Most people don’t add enough seasoning, so add more. Also with salt, if you don’t have any medical reasons for eating a low sodium diet, add more salt (like 2 or 3 times more). Even if you triple the amount of salt in your burger, it is still way less salt than a fast food burger, you will have a much better product."

"5) **forgot an important point : early History**

Oldest veteran ap hunters (2012), and people who are currently on top of the (stupid, see my other post) leaderboard, DID NOT play for ""catching"", getting the max number, getting as much as *others*, getting every unavailable ap and so on. It was not even possible :

* leaderboard didn't even exist. You only knew what others had because you came across them in dungeons (on your own server btw), or heard about them.
* AP was only about your own thing. There was no cap. Dungeon and Salvage infinite achievements had no cap. There were even some tp barons who salvaged countless salvageable items from the tp and got many thousands ap from that. So maximum number and comparing meant literally nothing. Those 2 caps were added quickly, but dailies still didn't have a cap for a pretty long time.

So basically, people who now have all or most of the old ap done are people who, back in 2012-2013, looked at AP in a way close to what I now suggest to new players : as their own progression, their own goals, and their thrill to be a completionist ... not the chimera of being at top of something compared to other players. We completed the first halloween's, winterdays', and first few LS1 episodes' AP because we wanted to *complete* and for our own progression ... despite losing on some dailies or -before caps were added- being late on hardcore salvage/dungeon farmers.

---

I think my own example is eloquent. For reasons that are out of topic, I started playing 2 accounts since release. I made sure I always completed daily on the one I was playing that day, but of course I missed a lot from that. But what ? I liked AP hunting. I liked completing all other achievements and always had a long-term goal of filling the achievement panes (which had lines instead of rectangle-buttons btw). I like progressing for myself, getting nice numbers to show, and making sure I didn't leave anything behind when a temporary achievement pane came up. All while having no chance to catch. I had no idea that dailies would get capped, that a leaderboard would come, that years later my accounts would be so high on it ... I was just an happy AP hunter as it was my playstyle since gw1 (title hunter). Then at some point leaderboards appeared, I was already pretty late on top guys because each account missed all the dailies I completed on the other one ... I still liked going for all achievs in ls episodes, still liked progressing toward the permanent core achievements. Then a some point the reward system was created and some people progressed further than I did (system awarded 1 chest a day till it reached out ap counts - btw it means that reviewing hot/pof/ls3/ls4 ap for better numbers would not break it , as it is rdy to distribute chests day-by-day), and ... well you guess the story : I had no chance to catch and get same rewards but still likes completing stuff and working toward my own next chests, knowing I would get those rewards, just later, blah blah. And a lot more time passed before dailies and monthlies got their respective caps (10k and 5k, later merged into 15k dailies) ... so I thought I was late forever but still enjoyed my progression and completionism (also didn't bother too much doing more dailies than necessary during the period with 10 to 23 separate dailies - each 1ap and do 5 for karma). Even later, the last caps were added (dailies) and at that point I saw that I had a chance to ""catch"" ... but it was after a long time of being a proud AP hunter despite ""catching"" being just as impossible for me as it is for OP now. I was left with some temporary achievs that I avoided due to them being too annoying and not *this* worth (after all, a few dailies -uncapped- would give me same progression) ... so what ? I kept looking at my progression and at next chests."

So yes, there is a problem with the current loot system  Are you going to look me in the eye (Metaphorically of course) and tell me this is a feature, and Intended to be a part of the gameplay experience?

I can maybe see some of the less required pick ups (like mods and BP's like oberon and harrow chassis) not being put in, but things that are specific rewards for an encounter, such as (eidolon shards, and arcanes, Or BP's from specific named targets) should be placed immediately into a players inventory, similar to how you say they've fixed certain issues with boss drops. Eidolons are bosses, their drops should go directly into the inventory. 

but at the same time, answer me this: Who benefits from a system where missed drops are possible? There are systems in games considered good, that all also clearly bad/monotonous/removable. Mass effect 2's resource gathering system comes to mind. Why do you think most chances at missing loot are removed from most games, including the mario exapmple you provided earlier in the thread?

There's also the question of different regions being impacted differently.

Are you daily driving your RS in the winter? If so, once you get your tire situation all set, I suggest you look into reinforcing your factory under tray or replacing it with an aluminum skid plate. There's two NACA ducts on the factory under tray that tend to fill up with slush and snow and end up ripping themselves or the whole under tray off the car. Poor thinking on Fords behalf on using such weak and absorbent material under the car but nothing to do now but deal with it."

"&gt;without giving leeway to anyone who has a different definition.

What are you talking about? There are extensions of atheism like ""strong and weak"" for example. 

&gt; the majority of atheists I've spoken to acknowledge that ""believing god doesn't exist"" is an acceptable definition.

Maybe for them sure. I mean I would even almost agree with that. But that's beside the point. The ONE thing that all atheists have in common is a LACK of belief in gods. You fundamentally cannot disagree with this. 

Yeah there are people who take it further and that's great for them, but you can't pretend every atheist claim no gods exists. That's just false.

&gt; Gnostic atheists are just types of atheists

I agree.

&gt;trying to say they aren't atheists

I didn't say that. 

&gt;Dictionaries define words.

But people use words differently than they are defined all the time. That's how the definitions of words change over time.

&gt; Do you honestly think atheists are the only ones who get to define the term?

Well yes, they get to define how they use the word. If they simply lack belief in gods they are an atheist that lacks belief in gods. If they are an atheist who thinks they know no gods exist, then they take it further and make that claim. 

But we aren't talking about individual atheists. We are talking about all of us. And the definition of atheism that all of us fall under is ""lacking belief in gods"". THEN portions of us take it further. I'm not sure how you are struggling with this so much. Or why tbh. You seem to just hate that atheists don't believe in your god or something and are trying to make them claim something for once.

&gt;Number 1 absolutely should be there

No, it shouldn't, at least not ""first"" because it does not represent all atheists. That's not what ATHEISM is, that's what atheism is to some people.

&gt;IT'S SO MUCH FUCKING MORE than just that.

It is objectively not for many many people. 

You're trying to group all atheists under an umbrella they don't belong under. 

Stop being a disingenuous prick and accept that not all atheists are making a claim. In fact, the vast majority of us don't make any such claim as you would like to have people think."

Seeing how fat and dirty arthur can get
"I do think that it is essential to keep in mind that the books are not about Kaladin. It was never Sanderson's intention for them to be so. The Way of Kings was about Kaladin, that was his intention. Words of Radiance is about Shallan and Oathbringer is about Dalinar with the next two being about Szeth and someone I will not mention, but you can do some digging if you would like. Each of these books has a main character, but the Stormlight Archives does not have one. Since Kaladin is first, it is hard to get around the feeling that he should be the main character, which I can understand. It is also hard to get around that feeling due to Kaladin just being awesome and fun to read, but once you do get over that feeling of that Kaladin should be the character in the spotlight, you will notice just how big of a scope that Sanderson is trying to tackle and see how remarkably well he is doing at it and how that, in the long run, the books would fall apart if he stayed on Kaladin.

 In fact, if you do some looking around on the 13th Shard or the Coppermind (a forum website and wiki website run by fans that tend to get a lot of interaction from Sanderson), you can actually find early versions of Way of Kings where Kaladin's progression to working under Dalinar is MUCH MUCH different. You can tell it is written in a way that puts/keeps Kaladin in a constant spotlight of focus...and it is not very good. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are hundreds of little details and strings being pulled in the background that you can catch glimpses of that all begin to thread everything together, slowly but surely everything is coming along. It is impossible to do something of this scale while keeping a main character. There is simply too much going on, and an easy way and most common way of this being seen are with a character working as the Wit to the king. If you are a big reader of Brandon Sanderson, in general, you will know why, but even if you just read the Stormlight Archives, it is apparent that the King's Wit is not some simple side character. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love these books, and I love Brandon Sanderson as an author and a person as well. His books are already an epic fantasy with each of his books in the Stormlight archives hitting the 1000+ pages area yet he still provides so much you can learn, research, and reread with each time giving you new details and perspectives that can blow your mind. Even with all this detail he still somehow manages to write a coherent and stable plot line that anyone could follow and that most would like. Which puts Brandon Sanderson to me, a mark above everyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are looking for a storyline that is remarkable and that follows an utter badass in the fantasy genre. ""The Name of the Wind"" by Patrick Rothfuss is probably one of my favorite books is of all time and something that I strongly recommended. It sounds like it would fit closer to more of what you are wanting. Although, I still recommend you keep giving Stormlight a try or to do more research into the books. It is really quite fun. "

&gt; Mary Jane Blige (born January 11, 1971 in Bronx, New York, United States), is an American R&amp;B, Soul, and Hip Hop singer, songwriter, rapper and actress. Known as The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul and The Queen of R&amp;B, she has sold over 75 million records worldwide. 

&gt; In 1992, Blige released her debut album What's The 411?. The album sold 3.4 million copies on the strength of singles You Remind Me, Real Love, Reminisce, Sweet Thing, and Love No Limit. The album pioneered a new genre known as Hip-Hop Soul and is credited with influencing the marriage of Hip-Hop and R&amp;B.

&gt; In 1994, Blige released her sophomore album My Life. Blige wrote or co-wrote fourteen of the seventeen album tracks. Supported by singles Be Happy, Mary Jane (All Night Long), I'm Goin' Down, and You Bring Me Joy, the album sold over three million copies and was certified 3x platinum by the RIAA in 1996. It has since been included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

&gt; Not Gon' Cry, a 1996 single written and produced by Babyface for Waiting To Exhale soundtrack (1995), peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Blige's highest charting single of the 1990s. The same year, Blige won her first Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for her performance on I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By by Method Man.

&gt; On April 22, 1997, Blige released her third album, Share My World on MCA Records. Blige cut ties with producers Sean Combs and Chucky Thompson and worked with the likes of Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, Rodney Jerkins, Babyface, R. Kelly, and Poke &amp; Tone. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with sales of 240,000 copies, Blige's first to do so. Supported by singles Love Is All We Need, I Can Love You, Everything, Missing You, and Seven Days. Share My World was certified 3x platinum by the RIAA and sold nearly 4 million copies in U.S.

&gt; In Summer 1998, Blige embarked on the Share My World Tour, which resulted in a Gold-certified live album released later that year, simply titled The Tour. The album spawned one single, Misty Blue.

&gt; On August 17, 1999, Blige's fourth album, titled Mary was released. It marked a departure from her more familiar hip hop-oriented sound; this set featured a more earthy, whimsical, and adult contemporary-tinged collection of songs. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 239,000 copies in its first week. It spent 57 weeks on the chart and produced four charting singles: All That I Can Say, Deep Inside, Give Me You, and Your Child. Though not as successful as prior releases, the album still sold 2.1 million copies in the U.S. and was nominated for a Grammy for Best R&amp;B Album.

&gt; On August 28, 2001, MCA released Blige's fifth studio album, No More Drama. The album's first single, Family Affair (produced by Dr. Dre) became her first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, where it remained for six consecutive weeks. Two other singles, Dance For Me and No More Drama were released, with the latter becoming a Top 20 hit. On January 29, 2002, the album re-released and featured three new songs, one being Rainy Dayz, which was released as a single and became another Top 20 hit for Blige. No More Drama has since sold 3.2 million copies in the U.S. and 5 million copies worldwide.

&gt; In 2003, Blige won her second Grammy (and first as a lead artist) for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for ""He Think I Don't Know"".

&gt; On August 26, 2003, Blige's sixth album Love &amp; Life was released on Geffen Records (which had absorbed MCA Records.) Blige reunited with producer Sean Combs for the album. Despite the album debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and becoming Blige's fourth consecutive UK top ten album, Love &amp; Life became Blige's then lowest selling album selling 1 million copies. Still, it was nominated for Grammy Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album.

&gt; Geffen Records released Blige's seventh studio album, The Breakthrough on December 20, 2005. For the album, Blige collaborated with J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, Rodney Jerkins, will.i.am, Bryan-Michael Cox, 9th Wonder, Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, Raphael Saadiq, Cool and Dre, and Dre &amp; Vidal.  It debuted at number one on both the Billboard 200 and Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Selling 727,000 copies in its first week, it became the biggest first-week sales for an R&amp;B solo female artist in SoundScan history. The official lead single, Be Without You peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, while peaking at number one on the R&amp;B chart for a record-setting fifteen consecutive weeks. In March 2017, Billboard Magazine ranked ""Be Without You"" as the most successful R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Song of all time. The song was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year and won the Best R&amp;B Song and Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance categories at the 2007 Grammy Awards. Other singles included Top 40 Hit Enough Cryin, Top Five R&amp;B song Take Me As I Am, and UK Top Three Hit One. The Breakthrough won the Grammy for Best R&amp;B Album in 2007.

&gt; In December 2006, a compilation called Reflections (A Retrospective) was released. It contained many of Blige's greatest hits and four new songs, including the worldwide lead single We Ride (I See the Future). The album peaked at number nine in the U.S, selling over 170,000 copies in its first week, while reaching number forty in the UK. It has sold more than 1.6 million copies. 

&gt; Blige's eighth studio album, Growing Pains, was released on December 18, 2007, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 and at number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It sold 629,000 copies in its week and was certified Platinum by the RIAA. The album won Grammy for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album in 2009. It spawned the Top 40 Hit Just Fine.

&gt; Blige's ninth studio album, Stronger with Each Tear, was released on December 21, 2009, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 and at number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, selling 332,000 units in its first week of release. The album had sold 726,100 copies in the United States by April 2010, and was certified Gold by the RIAA on January 6, 2011.

&gt; Blige was honored at the 2009 BET Honors Ceremony and was paid tribute by Anita Baker and Monica. 

&gt; Blige's tenth studio album, My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act 1), was released in November 2011. The album debuted at #5 on the Billboard 200, selling 156,000 copies in the first week; it was eventually certified Gold in 2012 and has sold 763,000 in the US.

&gt; A Mary Christmas, Blige's first holiday album, was released on October 15, 2013 through Matriarch and Verve Records. In early December, A Mary Christmas became Blige's 12th top ten album after it rose to #10 in its eighth week and was certified Gold by the RIAA.

&gt; Think Like A Man Too, which serves as Blige's 12th studio album, was released on June 17, 2014. On Billboard's Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, the soundtrack album charted at number six, marking Blige's 16th top ten entry on the chart, tying her with Mariah Carey for the second-most top tens by a female artist.

&gt; Following her concert date at the Essence Festival, on July 9, 2014 it was announced Blige would move to London to experiment with a new sound for her new album. Blige spent a month in London recording her album in RAK Studios with a host of young British acts, including Disclosure, Naughty Boy, Emeli Sandé and Sam Smith. Twelve new songs, co-written and recorded by the singer, were released on November 24, 2014 on an album entitled The London Sessions. The album received acclaim and was included on many Best Albums of 2014 lists. The album debuted at number nine on the Billboard 200 and number one on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, with 55,000 albums sold and 2,000 shifted in album-equivalent units. It became her 13th top ten entry on the Billboard 200 and her tenth number one entry on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop albums.

&gt; Following a heavily publicized divorce from her husband and manager Kendu Isaacs, Blige released her thirteenth studio album Strength of a Woman on April 28, 2017. Supported by Urban AC hit singles Thick of It and U + Me (Love Lesson), Strength of a Woman debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 on the issue dated ending May 20, 2017, with 78,000 album-equivalent units, selling 72,000 standard copies in its first week. It became Blige's highest-charting album since 2009's Stronger with Each Tear, and her tenth top five entry on the chart. 

&gt; In 2017, Blige starred in the period drama film Mudbound directed by Dee Rees. Playing Florence Jackson, the matriarch of her family. For her performance in Mudbound, Blige was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also received nominations for Best Original Song for Mighty River, becoming the first person nominated for an Academy Award for acting and original song in the same year.

&gt; On July 12, 2018, Blige released a new single, titled Only Love. Read more on Last.fm.

"Apart from Blood Elves dominance in M+, racials have been reasonably balanced since 6.0. Blizzard has a history of making important PvE Bleeds (e.g. Blackhand) undispellable by Stoneform and similarly making targeted abilities impossible to dodge with Shadowmeld... but they didn't think to make only certain buffs dispellable with Arcane Torrent? That'S the real idiocy here, apart from letting Arcane Torrent stay in its state throughout Legion.

Now obviously high end raiders *did* faction change to Horde when their racials were overpowered, but they won't switch back to Alliance just because the racials are (close to) balanced again. Now most higher end guilds are on Horde, so even lower end PvE players switch just because there's more potential guilds on Horde, then guilds switch to Horde because recruiting PvE players is easier - a vicious cycle that will continue even if racials were perfectly balanced."

"You sound very considerate.  A Mass card is not necessary.  The meaning of it is that you are offering a Mass for a small donation to benefit the soul of the deceased.  Then the family receives the card and is consoled that someone offered a Mass for their family member.  There is no reason why you as an atheist cannot offer a Mass, but since you don't fully understand it and might not be comfortable with it, there really isn't any compelling reason for you to do so.   Flowers are fine, too, or just a sympathy card and your sincere condolences to the family.   If you do decide to offer a Mass for the deceased person, don't worry about it being on the same day.  Go to a church of your convenience and then mail the card to the family later.

No one who likes the genre complains about the mechanics. So that's a given. If that's what you care about the most, you won't be disappointed. But there is a giant divide on the story aspect. I'll get downvoted to fuck, but there are just as many valid complaints about the story as there are people who suck its dick. And if you end up in the, this is a fucking story? side, you'll massively regret spending sixty on it.

Edit: replied before reading this thread. For a long time even saying it wasn't amazing would get you -30 karma. The fact that the majority here are saying its story sucks speaks volumes."

In my case I realized I had some promising plot threads but what I was missing was tying those ideas to villains. Once I made that connection it was a bit easier for me to make connections between some of the villains and the plans they have and want to enact and at which points the players would enter the scene.

It just comes! That is the miracle of it. We are not fighting it, neither are we avoiding temptation. We feel as though we had been placed in a position of neutrality—safe and protected. We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed. It does not exist for us. We are neither cocky nor are we afraid. That is our experience.

Nope, you're also incorrect.   


It was the battle flag of the  Northern Virginia Army. Later it was co-opted by racists in the 1950-60s to protest the civil rights movement.  


It was at no point the flag of the Confederacy nor Battle flag of the Confederacy, just that of the N. Virginia army. There were some quite similar flags (or similar portions) used by others in the Confederacy, but not the same as the current ""rebel flag"".  


There is no way to remove the past instances of this flag being used by racists as a symbol of their racism and movement. Usage in modern times signals (knowingly, intentionally, or not) that those displaying it are racists due to its past historical usage."

"&gt;Innovative doesn't actually save you that much monarch points if you compare it with other idea groups, Economic not only saves you development cost, but also allows you to roll in money to buy those mercenaries with, and even reduces upkeep cost for regulars, and Administrative saves you points not only on coring (which is a lot of admin points even if you dont conquer that much land) but also gives you -10% admin tech cost and cheaper mercs.

I guess I wasn't clear.  Assume I wrote my post completely from the perspective of going tall and being a tall player.

1 – “Innovative doesn't actually save you that much monarch points if you compare it with other idea groups,” really?  Let's say I can’t wait longer to take out military tech, and I can wait some, but not very long for diplo tech (my navy is essential for me to use the Tsugaru Strait to survive, or if you're playing the Netherlands your navy really is absolutely essential regardless), and I grant you I could wait longer to pick up admin techs. Given this, say I wait for the -70% reduction in admin (I'm giving the benefit of the doubt on this calculation), -15% on diplo, and -5% on military. This means I’m saving per tech level (600*0.3+600*0.85+600*0.95)*0.1=126 mana per tech level, and over 27 tech levels that’s 3402 mana, that's more than just some theoretical ""on paper"" thing, right?  That's the largest mana saving out of any other idea group, definitely more than with CCR for a tall run, speaking of which...

2 – I still don’t get the adjustment on the CCR being beneficial for tall. I’d have to take provinces that had (3402/10)/(0.25)=1360 of provincial development to match innovative (which I'd say that's ""that much land"" and then some...). But during a tall run, I take a very minimal number of provinces (in my Ainu run: 4 (Ho'rep'un'sur, and the provinces in state Deren and Sakhalin are in)) and then I colonize which usually gets fed to vassals or to colonial nations.  I don't understand how CCR is useful if you're going for a tall challenge.

3 - Devving is kind of the point of running a tall campaign, but even with economic you'd have to dump almost 3402/.2=17010 mana on devving to be at par with innovative."

"&gt; Perhaps I wasn't clear - measuring the harmfuless of a drug ought to go well beyond whether it affects other people or not. MDMA, for example, is notoriously benign - at worst it makes you a better person to other people. But personally? Significant neurotoxicity with heavy, sustained use. That hurts people for life and we shouldn't pretend it's not there just because it's not drink driving.

&gt;Heroin is the same. Addicts are mostly benign, sitting around and nodding off all day. Harmless. But what sort of a life is this to live? If we can prevent it, we ought to.

I should have started with this: I study pharmaceutical science, majoring in chemistry and pharmacology. I know better than most what drugs can do on a mental and physical level. And yet, whilst I agree with most of what you said, here's the thing: as long as people are informed about the decisions they make, if they knowingly opt to engage in risky use, it's not up to us to determine what sort of life they should be living. It's theirs, not ours. Our obligations are ensuring they're aware of the harm they could be doing to themselves, and ensuring help is available if they go too far. You can't remove personal responsibility from the decision-making process in any risky behaviour, least of all by attempting to kill it off completely. 

&gt; I don't think it's productive to compare some of these substances to risky sex practices, and even alcohol in some cases. 

I was using them to make a point, because they are in fact completely comparable. We know it's playing with fire to try meth/H/crack, and we opt not to because we know the risks. We know them because we've been educated on them. If I choose to change my mind and end up hooked, that's on me, because I knew where I could end up. And when a real from-the-heart push to get clean begins, there are rehabs, counsellors, 12 step programs, support groups, doctors and others I can reach out to when I'm struggling. 

And all of this applies to both alcohol, and sex; if I know that a girl I'm sleeping with has a sketchy sexual history, and I choose to go in raw, any STDs or pregnancies are on me, because I was educated on the risks. And there are services available to help with problems if they arise. 

&gt; If you smoke, snort or (God forbid) shoot either of them, or any other hard drug, you quickly see why people throw everything away chasing them. They should never be freely available for this reason. Again, I'm not saying every single person that's ever tried them gets addicted, I'm just saying a not insignificant portion of the populace is predisposed to forming problematic habits with them and it's best if we never let them fall prey to that.

Okay, I'm seeing where our differences are coming from. I think you're letting your compassion and empathy for others override their own personal responsibility. It's not your call, or mine, or their parents or relatives or partners or anyone's, to make people do what you think is best for their own health. Whether you are right or not, does not matter. It is completely irrelevant. People need to be able to make their own decisions, and they need to deal with the consequences. We can't shelter people because we're worried about them. If someone's making a decision relating to risky behaviour, be it sex, or drugs including alcohol, or traveling to the middle east as a loud-mouthed blue-haired feminist, then all you and I are obligated to do, and all we should do, is make sure they're making a properly informed decision, and that they know who they can reach out to if they get into trouble. We might change their mind, we might not. Either way, it's not our decision. It's theirs. 

And through all this, we haven't even mentioned that drugs are completely accessible to anyone who wants them right now anyway. This discussion was initially about regulating a dangerous market to eliminate the problems that come from prohibition. We've ignored your premise, that a regulated market would increase accessibility. A stupid amount of us use a stupid amount of drugs as it is. I don't believe for a second that, outside of folks trying a wider variety of substances, any uptick in overall accessibility would be even statistically significant. I know it would obviously increase *perceived* accessibility, mostly by those who would never use anyway. Right now though, anyone who wants drugs has no problem getting them."

"For a pocket 357 I picked the Ruger SP101. I had S&amp;W 60 &amp; 640, and Ruger LCR in 357 but I prefer the extra bit of weight in the SP101.  Not as easy to carry but much easier to shoot.  
Edited in: If you go Ruger LCR hunting, even if I only ever intended to shoot 38 I’d still get the 357. The extra ounce and a half (or whatever it works out to) makes recoil much more manageable.

"Kinda maybe sorta.  

I have two cats, one dog and one five year old daughter.

Some things are the same:

* I have to deal with poop!
* I have to take care of them
* My schedule and free time is limited
* I spend money on them
* In return for all this I get emotional satisfaction.  In other words, they're all worth it because they make me happy.

In other ways they're very different:

* Kids grow up and become adults.  In fact, that's my goal with my daughter, to make her a self sufficient and well adjusted adult.  Pets stay pets.  I will always be picking up poop after my pets, with my kid it stopped at age 3 when she was potty trained.  There's a large element of change with kids that's absent with pets.
* The intensity of the emotional return is much higher with kids, at least for me.  Which is appropriate I suppose because the costs are also proportionately higher.
* I have an expectation that my pets will die before me.  That means I don't get as attached to them and their death, while it hurts a great deal, is something I can recover from.  I have an expectation that my child will out live me and her death would be devastating on a level I can't even comprehend.
* I have a cap on my expectations for my pets.  I've taught them enough to make their life and mine easy and that's it.  My expectation of my daughter is much more open ended.  I sincerely hope she surpasses me and everything I've done.
* At the end of the day, my relationship with my pets will always be an unequal one.  They're pets, I'm human.  By way of comparison, while there's certainly inequality in my relationship with my daughter, my goal is to eliminate that inequality as she grows up.  I'm teaching her to be my equal and to do that I need to see that potential in her even now when she's five.  I see no such potential in my pets.

So yah, there are some similarities but it's also dramatically different."

"Depends on your major, really. There are some programs at Behrend that are better than UP (e.g. Plastics, IBE). If you graduate from Behrend, your diploma itself will display “Erie, the Behrend College” underneath the Pennsylvania State University. When I would go the career planning center, they always said you don’t have to designate that you went to Behrend specifically, you can simply put Penn State University. 

I wouldn’t really worry about the image. A Penn State degree is a Penn State degree. Employers won’t really care. I decided to stay at Behrend because I liked my professors and my program there, and I had a lot of good friends who stayed as well. If UP has better facilities for what you’re going for, or if you simply want to go there to experience life in state college, then it’s a no brainer. But as far as job opportunities go, simply having UP on your diploma or resume won’t make much of a difference. "

"This is, unfortunately, gibberish created when someone types a phrase in the Latin alphabet and then changes i to a tengwar font. It says, more or less, ""a whv chach achomch s chvcha seuw perdsldw wha""

The original can be tentatively reconstructed by typing the string of nonsense into a word processor and changing back to a normal font. It returned ""Eor ana nahta i aran ilyë quáimëon"", which has a few Quenya words but is itself nonsense -- ""...towards slay the king all...""

At least it looks pretty!"

This test also occurred in 2003, after which he was constantly tested until the end of his career. He didn’t fail a single test during that time.

"I don’t know anything for sure here but I kind of imagined nuke sites to be fo different difficulties and compliment each other.

For example, a boss in nuke site A might drop a weapon that does increased damage or armor that gives increased protection from a boss in nuke site B.  Or at least the schematics for that weapon or armor.  So if you want the pattern for (insert cool thing here) off the boss in nuke site B then you’re gonna have to spend some time grinding nuke site A to get the patterns and materials to make the stuff to make nuke site B doable.  Essentially creating a loop of getting better from 1 nuke site to potentially take on more difficult or different nuke sites.

As far as PVP goes the competitive aspects of it need to be just be separated from the game entirely with its own end game.  PVP as it is is fine for PVE players.  It’s largely ignorable but can still be fun to piddlefuck with every now and then.  The hunter/hunted mode is a good start but it needs to have real rewards that are exclusive to PVP and it needs to have a way to support teams.  Or maybe there should be a duel system where each player/team puts something on the line and agrees to the terms and then are instanced and fight to the death with the winner getting the rewards.  Essentially combat gambling.  PVP could also potentially reward nuke codes that create a PVP nuke zone when launched.  Just a thought."

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/b52cbd4385188218d2e810bb2f472a39.png)  

&gt; Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California, United States. The group was formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers while its members were still in high school and originally consisted of Adam Levine (lead vocals, guitar), Jesse Carmichael (guitar, backing vocals) Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums). Kara's Flowers signed to Reprise Records and released an album, ""The Fourth World"", in 1997. After a tepid response to the album, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college. Dusick and Madden stayed local at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the east coast to attend Five Towns College. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.

&gt; In 2001, the band regrouped, with guitarist James Valentine added to the line-up, and pursued a new direction under the name: Maroon 5. At this point, Jesse Carmichael switched to playing the keyboards and this has become his main instrument in the band (although he also plays rhythm guitar to this day). After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with Octone Records and released their debut album, ""Songs About Jane"", in June 2002. The album's lead single ""Harder to Breathe"", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, the band toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's ""1.22.03.Acoustic"" and 2005's ""Live Friday the 13th"". In 2006, Ryan Dusick officially left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band recorded their second album, ""It Won't Be Soon Before Long"" and released it in May 2007. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, ""Makes Me Wonder"", became the band's first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100.

&gt; On September 21, 2010, the band released their third studio album entitled ""Hands All Over"". It was re-released in 2011 to include the single ""Moves like Jagger"" (featuring Christina Aguilera). While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, ""Moves like Jagger"" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band released their next album, ""Overexposed"", on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were really successful on the charts - for example, the second single from Overexposed, ""One More Night"" (released on June 19, 2012), reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, ""V"", with the very-first line-up of six official band members, as keyboardist and backing vocalist PJ Morton became an official member in 2012. The album debuted at top of the weekly Billboard 200 chart. Since its debut in 2002, the band has sold more than 15 million albums in the United States and over 100 million singles and 27 million albums worldwide. Read more on Last.fm.

Recruiting is an unsolved problem. In some ways it's an adversarial game because applicants are always trying to present themselves as well as possible (sometimes dishonestly) and recruiters are trying to cut through the bullshit buzzwords and figure out if someone can fulfill minimal job requirements.

Because this is the reality with recruiting, when you have a situation where a single job posting can get 200, 300 responses, with the vast majority of them unqualified applicants, you have no choice but to force people to jump through tons of hoops."

"1) [Vaccination stats] I read the page, and unless Im mistaken, there is no mention of people who are allergic to vaccinations. Perhaps you can get me closer to that value if elsewhere on the site. 
2) [Ethics in medicine] No, vaccination is not eugenics. But we DO have large medical boards continuing to discuss ideas which flirt with eugenics to this day. There is present cause to be suspicious of medical science.
3) [Autonomous cars] No. For the rest of as long as youre willing to respond, let us assume that vaccination is 100% effective with 0% complications. This is likely overly generous considering some people have allergies to them. Bullet three, which was your numbering convention, was in my mind a discussion on the ethics of autonomous vehicles. It relates to vaccintion in that it is an esoteric technology which people may fear. Further, it is an innovation that may quickly become federally mandated. 
4) [Smoking] In terms of parts-per-million, there is basically no dispute that those sorts of open-air public settings should allow smoking. People may be jerks and exhale all over you, but Im doubtful there is a lasting, debilitating or measurable, effect in infrequent exposures to adults. There is no cause or intent, theres no feasible legal dispute. Cancers do happen to non-smokers as well, you know. Theres no telling when you got it or why, only (careful) probabilities. You couldn't determine the specific mutagenic exposure that creted the illness.  Most importantly, you (as a legal adult) have the ability to move, there is no waiting line. Dont stand shoulder to shoulder with people engaged in activities you find disgusting, communicable or not! At some point, its up to the individual to save themselves. You cannot reasonably expect to regulate away the intrinsic dangers in the world.  And, if you think its possible, I hope you didnt care much for your income, or autonomy. "

"Oh my, I cried my eyes out during this episode. It hurt me so much as well. The parallel between her death scene and the last flashback scene was also extremely well written. She was left alone in her final moments looking for help, asking to be woken up from her nightmare, being taunted by Poppy.. and she died alone and scared. And then directly switching to the flashback scene where she told her husband and kids to go on without her, and he says, ""How could we?"" as if he would never leave her, and he wouldn't have any idea what to do without her. It was heartbreaking."

"Of course, something has to allow the accounts to talk to one another (something has to move the money, after all). It's just that you can do it in Europe without having to know all of someone's account info (ie a personal check) or having to deal with a private third party (if you want to do it digitally). 

Mostly, I'm thinking of something called SEPA, which is standardized system that is bank-to-bank. So, as opposed to having to go through an additional private entity (PayPal, Cash App, etc), a transfer can be made instantly between EU bank accounts online/in the bank's app, etc, for free (usually). In the US, there's no nationwide Fed-implemented equivalent, so the void is filled by private companies."

"And thats cool. But literally every playstyle thats NOT using a shotgun gets fucked over and imposes a handicap.

Theres a reason shotguns are statistically used %wise as much as primaries... theyre too easy to use and too dominant right now.

Its not only about feeling powerful with shotguns. Smgs, sidearms, fusions, and snipers should all be viable and just as powerful as shotguns are now, but theyre not, which is why people who dont primary a shotgun are asking for them to be brought in line with all other specials.

You could say ""just buff everything else"" well thats just impossible without completely breaking the relevance of primary weapons.

"Thats only land mass they use in that calculation. We're surrounded by three oceans that also sequester carbon, alot of it. So the actual amount we're carbon negative could be much higher than what theyve stated.

I think the interesting oart about this is people reluctance to consider this, and then once accepted they often tend to want say we still need to do better or something. Yeah sure, wasting resources is not acceptable but lets start questioning why weve been misled to think our reduction will have any significant impact (it wont we're too small) and start talking about where the point of diminishing returns is in terms if creating carbon in order to build better infrastructure vs limiting it and also limiting growth of better infrastructure"

"Yes, by far. I'm optimistic that inroads could be made though, if we can just convince ourselves that most of them are good, yet misinformed, people in a bad situation. With that as a starting place, we could explain why universal healthcare is worth fighting for, that we too believe their children deserve a chance at a middle class life and education. That we might not have all the answers, but we're willing to learn about their concerns and fight to make sure that they are heard too.

"The Lepai ""Ti"" is newer, yes, but not better, per se.  The Tripath circuit was the selling point.

I forgot what power supply the original Lepai 2020 shipped with, but the new Texas Instruments only has a 3A wall wart, the new Kinter 2020 has a nicer 5A in-line transformer.

Also watch out for other clones like ""Lepy"" - Amazon even links to them saying its a newer version of a Lepai, not true.

You have an arc about her gaining confidence after being quiet and more insecure and she’s genuinely compassionate and supportive. She’s basically emotionally stable, kind-hearted, and growing out of her shell. Not particularly flashy or engaging in the way a Spike, Cordelia, Buffy, Angel, Anya, Faith, etc. are, but I don’t think she’s terrible either. I think she’s likeable and decently developed. 

I’d certainly take her over Kennedy. Good God. "

All the footage will help with is proving your innocence if an incident ever transpires into something unsavoury.

I use mine all the time for this, because i was once struck by a taxi in London (i was overtaking a bus and taxi tried to overtake me but ploughed into the back of me), and the driver got off without even a warning. Reason ""it was just an accident where neither were to blame"". Had internal bleeding, and damage to my spine/hip. A camera would have at least shown/proven my side of the story, that you cannot overtake a vehicle which is overtaking another vehicle.

"Ich denke das Hauptproblem ist, dass viele Details des Erwachsenenlebens einfach sehr kompliziert sind. Zu kompliziert, um da eine ""Sammlung an Lebenserfahrung"" draus zu machen - denn die wäre zum einen extrem umfangreich (viel Arbeit zu erstellen, noch mehr Arbeit sie aktuell zu halten), und zum anderen auf Reddit völlig falsch aufgehoben, da die Suchfunktion nach schon beantworteten Themen einfach zu schlecht ist.

Meiner Meinung nach würde es drauf raus laufen, dass die ""Frischlinge"" fragen stellen, und die Community die individuell beantworten muss. Grundsätzlich zuerst einmal mit ""Es kommt drauf an was du willst, denn..."", und danach meistens mit Links, denn so wirklich jedes Problem des Erwachsenenlebens wurde im Internet schon mal irgendwo diskutiert.

Und damit stellt sich die Frage, ob man die Frischlinge nicht gleich die Gelegenheit gibt, eine wichtige Fähigkeit des Erwachsenenlebens 2018 zu erlernen: Von Fragen zu Links zu kommen. Also effektiv zu googlen und schlechte Infos schnell zu verwerfen."

As for OP's concern about it being a recognized degree in the states, I also had the same concern, but as it relates to academia. If I wanted to work as a professor in the US with a PhD from Norway, I imagine that could be difficult.

&gt; Camping a walkoff puts you in disadvantage after 10 seconds.  It's about as effective as just running and jumping off the stage.

It’s not the same kind of disadvantage as the kind that you get when you’re offstage - if the stage is about to leave but you still have your footing, then it really is not so hard to worm your way back to a safe position, especially if the character you’re playing has decent mobility or movement options, or pressure tools to cover their return.

Bonus points if they frame that in terms of blanket generalizations about ALL men or ALL women or ALL [people of certain ethnicity] and they like you because they think you're not like that.

"Umm, off the top of my head:

- have yourself a travel-bag and put anything you're bringing in that, because ambiguity makes it more time-consuming to question you. If you do this, maybe don't play the medicinal card too easily. Prescriptions are specific, recreational is not.

- It's hard to say right now if officers are going to err on the side of caution when they see a container that appears close to 30 grams. They could either not bother weighing it unless it it's *clearly* over, or they might weigh it if looks like it might be *close* to over. Probably best not to give them a reason until we know how much they care. As always, be pleasant, and make them feel like they're wasting their time on an upstanding person.

- in the spirit of friendliness, you may be more compelled to answer where you got it from if they ask. Say that family grows it instead of a friend. It's easier to believe family wants to hand you larger quantities of free weed, they just want to save you money afterall. They will not start calling up your family to question them unless they already intend to charge you with something else and they *really* want to stick it to you.

- just in case, never answer a question with a sole ""yes"" or ""no"". That let's the officer create the narrative. Just tell them what you want to tell them and they won't bother with too many questions. Being short with answers can begin to sound evasive and makes you seem uncomfortable, which is a sign of guilt.

- and for those that might try, remember not to just jam all your bud into the first legal-weed container you have. If it says 3.5g on the side and you clearly have more than that in their, they're gonna know something's up."

"A lot of your questions will be answered in BB3 when they make cameo appearances on their lives a year later. 

Apparently the cast was a lot hornier than was portrayed, but from what I heard, the craziness was very accurate. Ultimately, this season thrives because of the historical context, since Reality TV was only just becoming big, and people were still afraid to do anything cutthroat and villainous. In contrast, Survivor: Borneo and TAO castaways received a lot of backlash and hatred for being outright strategic, and people were booted in BB1 early because they saw it as a game. It's why you have the Monica meltdowns, Kent lashing out at people, and the weekly Nicole/Hardy meltdowns, as they slit everyone's throats to play to win. It's one of the rare cases where everyone contributes to the season, and there are no duds."

"I am not really sure what to share for this one. So much to choose! I had to write a 500 word essay for one of my post-grad subjects where we had to mention a time in our life that was challenging and how that informed our abilities as a leader.

Though, as a life story... hmmm...

If I am honest, I have grown up incredibly privileged. I come from Australia and one of the wealthiest suburbs in Australia. I come from a very educated, successful family. I have two undergraduate degrees and am studying a masters. I have a pretty solid amount of job experience too, from working in startups to corporates, to working as a consultant, to mentoring, working in film &amp; television etc. I am only 23 years old. I have done a heap of travelling, I have traveled to 35 countries, I broke 6 continents when I was 20. I do have a decent amount of friends, perhaps only ~4 really close friends, and I have been lucky to have had 2 serious relationships.
I was given a car, and a lot of things growing up (but also made well aware how important being successful and doing things on your own is, so I am not a spoilt twat). I have been blessed with I guess, some good looks. I am lucky to have very clear skin and straight teeth too... which helps.

My life, does sound pretty perfect, on paper right. It is and it is not.

I suffer from a range of issues; mild - severe learning difficulties, Psoriasis, Coeliac Disease, Scoliosis, flat feet, a history of bad backs and lately - mental health issues. My family has a history of depression. All my family members have auto-immune diseases of some sort, whether it be thyroid or something else. 

My family are great, but they aren't warm people. They are all a bunch of 'know it all's and as a result, arguments ensue every night. It's tiring. My immediate family is not on very good relations with a lot of our extended family due to their strong personalities. There is a lot of pressure to marry the right person and a lot of pressure to be successful in life.

The field I am specializing in, Entrepreneurship and innovation (yes, it's possible) is so left of field, and random, and it's one of those things that can be either really good or really bad. There is no stability like a normal profession."

"You're thinking of the time after birth. What about the whole nine months leading up to that? 

Pregnancy and birth have very real risks and consequences for women. Due to biology, these cannot be taken over by the father if he wishes to have the child and the mother does not. 

Since not everyone has an easy pregnancy, she carries the risks of permanent alterations to her body. And not just in looks -  pregnancy can permanently pull apart your abdominal muscles (needs surgery to repair), birth can cause tears affecting bladder and fecal incontinence, you can have long term effects from gestational diabetes and other issues stemming from the hormonal fluxes during gestation, the baby may be oriented wrong so that the mother needs invasive abdominal surgery (C-section), etc. And even with the vast advances in modern medicine, death does still sometimes occur during pregnancy. 

Pregnancy and birth are common (obviously) - but this isn't a simple or easy thing to ask of the body. It's difficult, painful, and can be dangerous - even life-threatening. Going through with a surprise pregnancy is something that only the woman dealing with the possible consequences should be able to decide. 

People (men and women) value bodily autonomy - that **your body** is under **your control**, and other people don't have the right to make changes to your body without your consent. Pregnancy should be no different - risking a woman's health like that shouldn't be something forced on her by another person. "

"""To you first point, no I don’t really care about that too much honestly""

Sorry to hear that.

""Secondly it’s agreed by most scientists that gender is on a spectrum (i.e. Harvard, NatGeo)""

Then whoever at Harvard thinks that biological life operates by more than two genders, or an infinite spectrum, should be fired immediately for publishing bullshit ""research"".  But that's assuming someone at Harvard actually thinks that way, and you're not just pulling this out of your ass.  Also, did you seriously cite National Geographic as an authority on a **biological** subject?

""and dictionaries state gender is based moreso on culture and social differences.""  

Urban Dictionary isn't a reputable source.  
In all seriousness, just because a dictionary defines it that way, doesn't necessarily mean automatically 100% true.  I don't have to tell you that.

""Even your sex isn’t completely cut and dry,"" gender and sex used to mean the same thing.  Now ""gender"" is this term that serves as an excuse for someone to imagine they're a different sex than the one they actually have.  No matter how much you believe it, doesn't make it any more true.  Sure, maybe it makes you happy.  Just don't call someone out because you want to be a ""Real Boy"" when you were born with a vagina, or vice versa.

""as in there are cases where a newborn doesn’t fall under the XX and XY category.""  Those are hermaphrodites.  They exist, but they aren't transgenders or some secret mystery box gender that's way more common than ""the patriarchy"" wants you to believe.  

""One of the beauties of science is that it always changing""

The Laws of Physics don't change just because a keyboard warrior decides they'd prefer the world revolve around them instead of the Sun.  Why is a biological reality, such as sex, any different?  It's a Law of biology.  Sex doesn't change because the animals just wanted it to be that way.  It's all evolution.

""and always will as we learn more.  Just because we weren’t taught that there were multiple genders in high school (I wasn’t)""

Because it's fringe science.

""doesn’t mean we can ignore modern science and new understandings.""

This isn't science.  Show me a single study that proves people have more than two genders.  A single one.  I want to see this overwhelming proof that's been kept from me all these years?  Where are you guys hiding it?

""Trust me a year ago I agreed with your standpoint""

Then a girl you liked thought this way and in order to impress her you deluded yourself into believing something that has no basis in reality?

""I didn’t put much thought in it until somewhat recently tbh.""

Lol, what changed?  Got bored of your previous opinion, so you decided to switch to something with more novelty?  Doesn't surprise me.  ""Gender"", apparently, works the exact same way."

"Yeah that's probably right,  Income tax &amp; social security is lower but he would prob only notice the difference if he would withdraw a lot in salary.

I guess having a Swedish company there isn't too bad, 22% a year on profit + 20% when you take dividend. Take low salary + dividend, write off tech products on the company and when you live in a country like Spain with lower cost of living you can have it quite nice with most of your expenses just needing to be for rent, food and entertainment/hobbies.

Plus in Swedish companies it's insanely easy to write off almost any tech product if you have a good company description. Usually save about 50% or so of the cost if you take through company vs buying it with your income :D"

"What's slow?  Combat?  Roleplaying?  People not paying attention and constantly needing to get reminded?  All of the above?

For combat, have someone else track (on a whiteboard or magnet board everyone can see) initiative and someone else track damage.  This should help people know what's going on and help players remind each other.

For Roleplaying, have people team up when doing things.  Like going around town, do it in pairs.  Then you spend no more than 10 minutes working with one group then give them something to figure out ""ok, so that's what the barkeep said; you guys figure out the next step while I talk to the other guys"" and that should keep them engaged and discussing things while you're working the other guys.

This buddy-ing up will also help with the paying attention thing too.  It prevents the 4th player from having to wait an hour as you work through each other player's bit before getting to them.  You should have a basic ""no choice made"" decision if they have nothing when you come back to them.  ""Well, you spend a few hours drinking and thinking about things to do.  You are now drunk and stumble back to the inn and pass out.""

At the end of sessions, you (or preferably someone else, possibly rotating, and with bribery of a free Inspiration) write up a recap and post it.  Then read that recap at the start of the next session.

Don't be afraid to stop the off topic discussions after a few minutes.  Add a timer to time-sensitive challenges or discussions or combats as a fun way to, ostensibly, heighten the tension but also to keep them from rambling on.

Rule questions should be only get a minute or two of quick discussion before you make a choice and write down a note to check on it.  Then the next session you can point out the correct way to do things.  Note: don't do this if it is something Important.  Like a character death or major plot point or something that can turn a battle.  There are important questions and less important ones, and don't dwell on the less important ones.

Explain the changes to the players and indicate that things are going really slowly and see if they have ideas.  However, you may find they are fine with the game's speed and you may be the one needing to allow the more laid back rate of play.  I know you have a lot of good ideas and want to see them get there, but if they aren't bothered then you don't want to push too hard on speeding things up.  I still think the combat tracking and buddy RP sections are good ideas for any game, but maybe not as much on the timers and pushing for focus."

I think the biggest concern with court reporting is that continuing technological developments will render a lot of these jobs redundant but the same could also be said for paralegals to some extent.

&gt;Also, couldn't that idea lead to immorality being more common because people would feel like they could sin more? And that seems like something Satan would jump on. I'm not sure that's why I want to ask.

I see the logic of your point. Romans 6 explains why you shouldn't sin more if you believe your are forgiven.

https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=Romans%2b6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=amp 

&gt;Delayed Documentation

I would argue the delay is not so much with people who were alive and a few eye witnesses who could contest claims made. I would trust what my parents saw, would you? 

&gt;Examples are the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Judas, the Gospel of Peter, the Gospel of the Nazarenes, the Gospel of the Ebionites, and the Gospel of the Hebrews. It is likely that the truth of what happened lies buried amid the numerous tales told by all of these gospels

It is ironic that every gospel listed here which holds the supposed truth was written after the four gospels branded as delayed documentation. A good proportion of non canonical gospels were Gnostic adaptations written well after the four canonical gospels to twist the preaching to further their agenda. I believe Islam has taken a lot of inspiration from the gospel of Barnibus, I suggest you explore the authenticity of that!

Sorry but I don't know much about the two gospels part. I will be sure to explore it when I get a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

This is  a red-herring fallacy mixed with a bit of good, old-fashioned straw manning.  It has nothing to do with the discussion and is an attempt at diverting the argument, and the argument he's attempting to claim you've made isn't the argument you're making.

Coca-Cola causing damage to the environment is irrelevant to the conversation of trying to eliminate as much as you practically can causing animals to suffer, which is what you're talking about when you discuss veganism.

Technically you could make the argument that nothing is ""vegan,""  Cars, cell phones, owning a home, walking, breathing... But this only works if you attempt to characterize veganism as an absolute which means that you cause no harm to animals at all, people opposed to veganism love to do this, and you'll encounter it a lot, but that's not what veganism is.

Being vegan doesn't mean that you cause ""no"" harm, ever, and every vegan should be fully aware that doing so is impossible.  It doesn't even mean that you don't harm animals directly, I certainly would kill an animal if it threatened my safety or my family's safety without batting an eye, for instance.  It simply means that as much as PRACTICAL you diminish how much harm you cause.

Whatever indirect harm coca-cola causes to animals (they do not perform animal testing, so this is not direct harm) is minimal, especially when you compare it to directly paying someone to chop up an animal for you to eat...

Personally though, I like to approach logical fallacies like this one as an opportunity ""oh, you're right, Coke does hurt animals, tell you what, I'll stop drinking coke and you can stop eating meat and we'll both do our part to make the world better."" cue more BS of course, but when someone feigns sudden concern, I love to flip it on them."

"This is the answer right here. Most people don't realize that a vast, VAST majority of Star Wars merchandise outside of the initial Kenner run of figures is largely worth retail value *at most*. The reason why the original figures were worth so much is because there was a shortage of the figures at release - and the reason why some are worth more than others is because less were made which means there is a higher demand for them. 

That just doesn't happen now. They make figures in large quantities in order to meet customer demands. Are some figures still worth more than their counterparts? Yeah, sure. But that's because they are rare and in high demand. Go check out the price for an Original Black Series Darth Maul or  Boba Fett / Han Solo in Carbonite. Those things are worth 5-6 times their retail price because not a lot of them were made. 

And a whole lot of people could also just take advantage of ebay and see what items they want to value have sold for in the past. It saves a lot of time and ridicule. "

And if u say the average investor is not in to analyze trends and watever else... Then maybe that's why mutual funds and money managers are there for. This market majority people lose money. Don't play the game then..
 But certainly don't spread false advice of literally hold never sell because for those who actually TRY to understand and make a play as an average investor, because you're giving them bad advice. I don't want that.

Sure if u plan on not touching ur money for years then ya maybe ur fine, but I hardly doubt that. And even then, everything has a price.

"Just sharing my experience. I placed an order for a 64GB Just White 3XL (unlocked for T Mobile) and a white Pixel Stand on 15 October, original Est Delivery of 26 Oct. Then on 18 October I received 2 emails about 1 1/2 hours apart while I was at work (found them that evening), the first stating Est Delivery had changed to 1-2 November, the second stating 23-24 October. Well, follow the link through to my order details page, and what do I find? Estimated Delivery of 24-27 NOVEMBER!! Absolutely NO mention of this anywhere in email traffic, and doing a mock Checkout for the exact same order (without submitting) states an estimated delivery of 1 November. So I just got done chatting with the instant chat support, got my $25 credit going to my account, and I just cancelled my order. With how many I saw on here that had already received their phones despite ordering like a week AFTER mine...I have zero faith in their preorder system. I'm about to resubmit an order for the exact same thing, and I'll probably get it LONG before I would have if I had just waited...  


For a tech company the size of Google, this is utterly inexcusable, and positively PATHETIC, that preorders fall by the wayside and post-launch orders are already being delivered..."

"When I was about fourteen/fifteen I severed my Achilles tendon 90%, give or take. Least this is what I remember being told by the doctors.

Now you may be wondering; what was this mundane task that this poor fellow did that would've caused such an injury. 

I was cleaning my bedroom as it was your typical messy fourteen year olds bedroom. I had a full length body mirror hung up on the back of my bedroom door; for whatever reason I wanted to take the mirror off and set it down beside my door. What happens next is more or less a blurr, I remember the moments immediately before and after but the gap in between has some blanks, such as how the mirror broke.

So as it happens; I took the mirror off of the back of the door and set it beside the wall, leaned up. I shut the door and the suctioning of the door closing caused the mirror to fall over; either the mirror was broke before or this event broke it- I'm not sure. What I am sure of is the mirror breaking into two main pieces. One large top piece and one equally large bottom section, the top piece stayed stuck to the board with the bottom piece falling off and landing up against the back of my right ankle "

"I won't speak to every relationship out there, but I personally feel that one of the tenets of being in a relationship is looking out for each other.

I don't want to offend you, but I want to respond to your comment because it seems like you're pinning the blame solely on the wife. I think that's wrong and that any number of factors throughout their marriage could have contributed to her weight gain, like child birth or too much eating out. Or, she could engage in activities willfully and not have any self control. What I'm trying to say is, OP is also responsible for helping their partner stay healthy by engaging in healthy choices as much as possible. It's the internet, and you're allowed to say whatever you want, but since we don't know the full story behind their marriage let's not blame one party over the other unless the facts are clear."

"A ""lottery"" is really any form of gambling where a random number is drawn to pick a winner.

Today most lotteries are run by governments, even back when most other gambling was illegal. Basically people buy tickets, some of the money goes to the state and some goes to the ""jackpot."" It is a relatively easy way to raise revenue, and its history in the US goes back to revolutionary times.

In the past, especially in poor neighborhoods in the US, there were illegal lotteries that were usually run by organized crime rackets. If you've ever heard of a ""numbers game"" or someone ""playing the numbers,"" that's what that is."

"The thing is, I do like most Legendaries and Mythicals, I just think some of them could have been regular Pokémon instead, and nothing would really change. Phione is **the** example of this, with Shaymin and Meltan being prime examples as well, since it's very clear in all forms of media that there are multiple of them, and there's not really anything special about them besides being extremely rare.

Meloetta, Volcanion, Marshadow and Zerarora also just feel like extra rare and powerful, but otherwise regular Pokémon to me. I could even see Genesect being a normal man-made/fossil hybrid Pokémon, since the ancient Pokémon it's based on wasn't particularly special, and it itself can clearly be replicated. 

On the Legendary side of thing, Latias, Latios and especially Heatran take the cake. I would love Heatran if it was just a gen 4 counterpart to Metagross (which I get the feeling it was originally supposed to be), but instead they decided to make it a full blown legendary. Because... why not I guess?

This is very much a personal opinion, but the one trio I straight up dislike is the Tornadus/Thundurus/Landorus trio. I just feel like they don't add anything to the lore or game when Unova already have the Swords of Justice, and only serve to bloat out the amount of Legendaries. Same with the Ultra Beasts. I was never a fan of them, but they could at least have made for a cool one-off concept. Due to how they were executed though, I would personally have preferred if they just scrapped the Ultra Beasts altogether (except for maybe Nihilego). "

Best case you look in the pan and see how it looks and guess based on that. But even thats a crapshoot, since many people will change the trans fluid in a desperate attempt to fix a dead trans. Unless you take it down to the clutches you  have no way of knowing what shape its in. And even if it works you have no idea how long itll last. At least with engines you can do a compression and oil pressure test to get an idea.

"Yes exactly. At some point a service she used was subject to a data breach. This results in lists of usernames (typically email addresses) and passwords being sold on the dark web. She probably already mitigated the actual threat because most services lock your account or atleast inform you if there is suspicious activity going on and she probably changed her password for the compromised account. 

Was the password listed in the email still her current password? If it was, she should change her password for sure because it IS on a list. And also change any account of hers that uses that password listed in the email. For me it was an old password that wasn’t valid anymore, but must have been my password at the time of the said data breach. 

Not sure if you can check the email details on mobile, I used a PC. The IP address you discover is somewhat irrelevant since it will likely be from a foreign country, and probably has been rerouted through the onion router or a VPN of some kind.

Long story short; They likely DON’T have access to her email account, she certainly IS on a list on the dark web, DON’T use the same password on multiple sites / services, use 2 Factor Auth whenever it is available, and I personally recommend using a password manager such as LastPass just as that final guarantee of protection.

"Justification is not Salvation.

Justification is being marked pure to enter the ""holy of holies"" and be sealed with the Spirit, the guarantor of your inheritance, to reveal unto you a salvation at the end of the age (Eph 1, 1 Pet 1).

Salvation is quite literally your completed sanctification(theosis), biblically. When we are fully sanctified, and rendered utterly in the image of Christ, in perfect union with Him as the Church, then we are ""saved"" totally and completely. 

For now, we are marked as right through our allegiance to the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, through whom we are granted access to the Spirit, who renews our mind through our participation with Him in the ongoing renovation of the Cosmos.

This is the problem we have with talking to one another. We don't properly parse the components of redemption.

Justification is simply a status put upon you so that one can participate in the life of Christ.

Justification is not earned by special merit. However, those who are justified are to be sanctified through cooperation with the Spirit in good works, unto their full sanctification, leading to their total salvation at the end of the age."

So far, the results show that we should not exist assuming we were randomly created by the big bang. Why should we assume we are not intended if the experiment shows otherwise? Isn't that a form of faith since it isn't based on observed facts?"

Edit: As pointed out below, of course Trump didn't come up with the slogan himself. Reagan used it in the 1980's, and Margaret Thatcher in the UK used ""make Britain great again"" in the 1950's, albeit just as part of an election address rather than as a campaign slogan.

If that doesn't work.
2.Inform him more aggressively, I don't mean full on yell at him, more like controlled anger, be stern about it, use swear words, they can really amplify the anger you feel, tell him that if he doesn't stop you will break off all contact with him.
And most severe thing I can suggest.
3. Report him, if the above don't work tell a teacher right away, this isn't a normal joking behaviour, jokes is when friends insult each other and show memes to each other for shits and giggles, they don't sexually assault each other.

"Because they were supposed to have access to the field starting at 10:00 am. At 10:02 MSU tried to force them off the field, and then initiated conflict. Basically Michigan had the right of way, and even though they could have walked off the field for 2 minutes to let MSU do their walk, they had the right to be there. So MSU couldn’t force them off, even though “they do it before every game.” So maybe the Big Ten should keep an eye on the clock when MSU does this in the future. 

They could have fined Michigan for the field kicking, but it didn’t really do any actual damage so there was nothing to fine them for. "

Take a step back. He was already abusing you, why are you fixating on this one instance? Is it because you are trying to establish a clear cut reason to leave him, like 'he assaulted me during sex once so I can never go back', or are you just trying to catalogue the breadth of his cruelty towards you in which case to what end.

As for this, yes, given you made it clear you weren't comfortable his choice to continue was abusive. He then tried to throw it back in your face, showing he was aware he was being excessive but seemed to hope you would just accept it. "
"Their two most popular models are the Datejusts and the Submariners. They’ve been relatively unchanged for 60 years, in design and style. If you walked into a Rolex dealer to buy a Datejust, expect to spend between $5k and 8k for most standard models (no diamond or precious metal dials). A Sub will cost you between $8k and $10k. You can find 90s Datejusts all day for $4000 give or take, and 60s Datejusts all day for $2500-$3500, depending on quality. Again, the standard models, no rare references or diamonds. They have been relatively unchanged so aside from the metal quality, patina on the dial, and wear on the case and bracelet, it will look very very similar to a Datejust from 2001. Most people who aren’t “into” watches wouldn’t bother trying to find a vintage one, because that is a **very** complicated market, and you get no warranty and the movements are more delicate and don’t offer modern shock protection or modern water resistance. 

The Subs are slightly different. Some of the old ones have red font on the dial instead of white, and these are worth $30,000 instead of $5000. Again, very complicated, and if you’re not already deep into the hobby, I would advise against trying to buy a vintage Rolex without extensive research. 

There are tons of other models. My personal favorite is the Rolex Explorer I. The original model from the 50s will sell for $50,000. But a modern iteration can be found used for between $4000 and $5000. The GMT Master II is also a favorite, and another of my personal favorites as well. You can spend tens 50,000 on rare vintage models easily. But a normal, recently modern one will be $9000 to $11000 used. 

Other “favorites” are the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak. It’s a favorite for athletes and rappers. They usually opt for more ...bold, models, with diamonds and gold and such. But the standard steel one is $14000. 

There are tons of models and brands and it’s definitely something to have to dive into. But it’s a lot of fun! "

1. When you click on any of the headers except ""Name"", e.g. ""Run-2"", sorting ""works"", but it messes up the entire data. **Data from only 1 particular (clicked) column changes. All other columns stay still.** For example, ""test2"" - ""Run-2"" should always equal ""368460.1843"", but when you click on the ""Run-2"", ""test2"" does not move so its value changes. I hope you understand what I mean. I guess I need the entire table to follow the sorting, not only 1 column. Any solution on that?
2. As I described in my question, I wanted the **sorting in this way: red &gt; orange &gt; green&gt; no color. Once clicked again, do the reverse, and so on.** What I have now is messed up - try clicking it like 4-5 times. Any solution on that?

"Czyli, że sam pociąg seksualny do kobiet jest czymś seksistowskim?

To, że pociągają Cie kobiety nie oznacza, że masz je za gorsze, ani za lepsze, po prostu za seksowne.

To nie oznacza, też że to jedyny kontekst w jakim możesz je widzieć. To po prostu znaczy, że tak też je odbierasz.

Więc gdzie tu jest dokładnie ta dyskryminacja?

Trzeba tak samo seksualnie odbierać kobiety i mężczyzn, żeby nie być seksistą?

Chyba trochę za dużą wagę przywiązujecie do tego pociągu seksualnego, jeżeli to on ma wyznaczać czy masz różnych ludzi za równych sobie.

Z resztą te pośladki nie podobają mi się tylko dlatego, że są kobiece. Te drugie też są kobiece i mnie nie ruszają. Podobają mi się bo są zajebiste.

To że na obrazku są dwie kobiece dupy, to nie oznacza że jego przesłanie to kobieta = dupa. W tym wypadku akurat, że jędrna dupa jest fajniejsza od płaskiej dupy jest podstawowym założeniem, które musi mieć odbiorca żeby zrozumieć obrazek. Doszukiwanie się tutaj, że kobieta = obiekt seksualny jest tak samo trafne jak doszukiwanie się że kobieta = siatkarka. Z resztą szczerze nie rozumiem co jest złego w przedstawieniu człowieka jako obiekt seksualnego. To nie odbiera człowiekowi całej reszty jego natury, po prostu stwierdza, że ta też istnieje. Wiadomo, że nikt nie lubi być spłaszczany do jednego aspektu, ale żeby tego uniknąć musielibyśmy zaprzestać wszelkiej reprezentacji. Więc co jest złego w tej? Że jest seksualna? Wygląda mi to bardziej jak próba zaprzeczenia istnieniu pociągu seksualnego, niż walkę o równouprawnienie."

"&gt;How do you even pretend to make combat exciting if there is no risk of death?

I think you're working against the system there. It's D&amp;D combat, the slowest and clunkiest part of the game. Even *with* the risk of death it struggles to be exciting. (It probably *could* be exciting with a more tactical, wargame-y ruleset - less mindless full attacks for the fighters, less comparing-a-dozen-spells for the wizards - but apparently people [didn't appreciate that approach.](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_4th_Edition))

Anyway, you just prioritize other things as the focus of the story and invent additional consequences other than death. D&amp;D doesn't have to center around the question of winning a combat encounter vs death; combat can serve a more adjunctive role. TBH, with all the complaining /r/dnd does about ""Murder Hobos"", you'd think they'd prefer if it was less prominent."

Which Fox Farms soil are you using? I germinated my seeds in paper towels until they looked like this (less than 24 hours): https://m.imgur.com/vYyN1f8

Then I transferred them, roots down, into Solo cups with FF Happy Frog soil. I placed the solo cups in a heated germination station at about 80-85° until they broke soil: https://m.imgur.com/c9FQvLH

Then I transferred them into 1 gallon pots, but after 10 days, they nearly outgrew them. Here are the roots at 10 days: https://m.imgur.com/hyOufQu

Now, they’re in 10 gallon smart pots: https://m.imgur.com/bnG7KTO

Don’t give up yet. Raise your temps if you can, and keep that soil moist.

Best of luck! 

Edit: I re-read my response, and it sounds a bit misleading. For clarification, it took the seeds two days to break soil. They were in the solo cups for eight days before I transferred them to the 1 gallon pots, then into the smart pots. So, you’re looking at the roots of a 18 day old plant. "

Not only is there no RNG for loot, all the caves you explore are procedurally generated (and really well too). Between that and the ~8 biomes you can pick from and the mutators that can randomly generate with missions you get a freshish experience each time.

Also no RNG for cosmetics, you just earn in game money and crafting shit and use that to buy the hat/armor/mustache/beard/skin color that you want. 

And unlike Fatshark, when the DRG guys realized their roadmap wasn't 100% accurate they updated it instead of deleting it.

"&gt; I was shocked and saddened to read yesterday that the developers are  planning to fully release the game from early access with a lot of  missing content.  Honestly it's not only a bad business decision, but  also a disgrace and an insult to the loyal playerbase.  Wasn't 2018  meant to be the year of Dayz? 

It has been, the rebuilding of the entire game is starting to really come together, the devs have been working hard on working with the new game engine, rewriting everthing in the game. These things take time but i guess you are too dumb to understand the time it takes to script and write line after line of code to bring the game to life then having to hunt down broken lines of code along with fixing the bugs which have appeared in the totally rewritten game. If any one is deluded it is you and not the ""fanboy's"" as you put it. Last stress test was awesome and showed a lot of what is to come into a stable, enjoyable and non buggy version of the game which is what everyone wants. 

A lot of your list is nonsense because you clearly havent been following the progression being made along with actually trying out the progression of the complete rework.

"The thing that bothers me most about all this is that every person in America is being played like a damn fiddle by the Russians. Right and left. They're stoking the flames of both sides with the ultimate goal of internal conflict, and we're playing right into their hands.

Most Americans sit in a political echo chamber. This is *incredibly unhealthy.* Each side only sees what they want to see: Validation that they're right and demonization of the other side. This makes people think that discourse is futile ""because any reasonable person would see that I'm right, so anyone that doesn't agree with me isn't reasonable."" This leads to the idea that violence is the only option.

Sure there are some shitty people in power that shouldn't be in power, but people need to realize that our emotions are being harnessed and weaponized by a hostile foreign power that is trying to incite violence among ourselves. This didn't stop after the 2016 election, the Russian disinformation campaign is ongoing to this day. Trump wasn't their end goal. Their end goal is to destabilize our country by turning us against each other. Don't take it out on your fellow Americans, *take it out on the damn Russians for manipulating us.*

I don't care what side you're on. If you think violence is the answer to *any* of these problems, the Russians have already won."

"""Unfair punishment"" is determined by the country that is doing the punishing. As per US consulate rules, if the console sees that the prisoner is subject to treatment that isn't allowed in that country, they can raise the issue with the government of that country - and that's all they can do. They can't force the country to improve the minimum standard, or even enforce the minimum standard that the country has decreed. https://mx.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/

The entry that the consulate can provide some vitamin supplements might be a new one.

If you're captured by rebel forces in an area and the local government won't do anything, then the US government may get involved (with the blessing of the government, if there is any government). If you're an American arrested in Saudi Arabia for defacing a Koran, then the US isn't going to officially help you. If you take a gun into Mexico and are caught with it in your car, the US government isn't going to help you (officially).

You're better off than a local because most courts don't want international media attention and their own government staring down their neck, so US citizens are usually given much lighter sentences than a local would receive. But that's entirely because most courts are run by people who don't want new problems to deal with.

And in the Mexico case, the US government will let you back into the US with a bit of a hurry if you can get bond to escape a hellhole Mexican prison and make a run for the US border. And let's be honest, the Mexican courts and jails don't want to deal with the Americans anyway, so they're not in any hurry to chase you to the border or request extradition. It's not unheard of for a prisoner to be just thrown out of the jail after a few days/weeks of misery, and told to go home before they are recaptured after their ""escape"". But you won't find many people admitting to it."

"This seems stupid. 

If you have spent your whole life working as hard as any athlete does at the professional level, then there’s a good chance you already have an alpha personality. If you are having a good season, you wanna be out there with your brothers, you get your leg snapped, you are gonna cry. It’s painful and the emotion and adrenaline is gonna make you cry if you are prone to it. 

When you deny that you’re crying, then yeah that’s a bitch move. Own it, and keep moving forward. I cry when I watch someone accomplish something harrowing, when I see a touching moment when a soldier comes home to his family and moments like that. Does that make me a bitch? It’s not like I’m sobbing, I can’t help that it’s touching. 

It’s ok to have feelings, it’s just important to control your emotion. You guys are fuckin bonkers."

"That's not really the essence of ""Gangnam Style"".

The song was about how ridiculous people are for overspending on designer goods and going to high end clubs on the weekends to be hip and popular. It's not just about spending unnecessarily to the point of being broke, it's about maintaining a certain image. I'm sure many people in Gangnam have their debts or whatever, but plenty of them can easily afford the luxuries they have. 

Just took a look at the lyrics again and it's not even about spending habits tbh. It's more about the pressure to maintain very deliberately crafted appearances and personalities to attract people and appear more confident and well established. The song is poking fun at that. 

Some people do prioritize unnecessary luxuries over necessities, but it seems like the girl OP talks to spends most of her money on coffee and cigs, neither of which add to her ""prestige"" (using the term loosely here). Gangnam style, and more broadly Korean elitism, is about spending money to project an image of prestige and respectability.

"I don't despair. I'm simply preparing for a much harder fight than I think the Democrats are expecting.

Where you see an energized Democratic party I'm seeing *people* being outraged and seeing voting for them as their only solution.
 
Much of the Democrats resistance has just been to complain in such a manner that it can be easily ignored. This Right, The FAR Right does not give a shit about these 'rules' based complaints. It doesn't give a shit about all the articles and think pieces, the outrage in social media bubbles, the ineffective protests that can be ignored or even made into propaganda for them, the west-wing inspired orations to nobility and civility... Time and time again the Dems fail to see or understand this.

People are donating and voting for Democrats, but it feels more like a prayer to the unknown than any kind of hope. A weird 'lets go back to normal' chant. Just remember that that 'normal' led to this situation. I'd feel a lot more hopeful if the Dems had a leader and a cause, an idea of a solution that doesn't sound like something even Aaron Sorkin would dismiss as 'too wishy-washy'."

"This photo was taken by me, I got a chance to hear the Mighty Wurlitzer. One of only 3 in the world. 1,437 pipes, 6 tuned percussion as well as a wide variety of others.

It is such a visually and musically beautiful piece. When I first saw Peter rising up from the stage playing it, my first thoughts were absolutely blank. I could not believe how beautiful it was. Then when he started playing.. just wow. 
There was a noticeable cipher towards one of the right pipes which is sad, and I truly hope gets fixed because this is such a gorgeous organ.

After Peter played to Buster Keaton's, The Haunted House, he was able to play Toccata and Fugue, and let me tell you.. I had CHILLS running up and down my spine. It was truly an outstanding experience. As a Hi-Fi enthusiast, owning tons of nice equipment, I really have to say there's still nothing like hearing it in person. This was no exception. 
Afterwards Peter invited us up onto the stage, I was able to snag some photos of the Mighty Wurlitzer and a couple with Peter, and talk with him. He is truly an amazing, funny character. Great guy!

I really am so appreciative to have been able to experience this today and wanted to share."

"You try your best but you still fail? Sounds like ADHD inattentive type to me. When I was in 9th grade my parents wanted to get me tested, but I was so offended by the idea that they thought something was wrong with me, that I didn’t let them. Fast forward, I’m now 22 and just starting medication. It’s infuriating how much easier it is to get work done now. If I’d just gotten tested back then, maybe I could have gotten good grades for what, 8 more years than I did? This may not apply to you, maybe you don’t have ADHD. But I would check out HowToADHD on YouTube and see if her videos resonate with you. ADHD, when unchecked, can lead to RSD (rejection sensitivity disorder) and depression. I felt the need to comment, because I felt EXACTLY like this. I got shit grades, I felt like a disappointment, and I wanted to die but I didn’t want to let down my parents by doing it myself. I kept hoping a truck would lose control or something. And, even if you don’t have ADHD, definitely go into therapy (but make sure you find a therapist you resonate with). Good luck, and feel free to PM me."

"If you like reading, I highly suggest you check out “The Guns of August” by Barbara Tuchman.  Extremely detailed telling of the lead up to and first couple months of the war on the west front.  Doesn’t read like a text book either and will keep you riveted.  If you like that, follow it up with “A World Undone” by G.J. Meyer which is as detailed as Guns of August but covers the whole war and all fronts.  Lastly read “The Splintered Empires” by Prit Buttar which covers the end of the war, the Russian Revolution and Civil War and the 1920’s.

"&gt;than again, Gwen was kinda Shallow in the comics, so she needs to be rewritten almost completely besides her father and her name. :D 

Strong agree on this, Emma Stone's portrayal of Gwen did wonders for giving her character some depth and I think it gives her death that much more meaning. That being said, I'd love Insomniac, who has shown themselves to be a amazing at character development (I hated Miles before this game, and now I love him as one example), to take a crack at writing their version of Gwen (who honestly I hope is just Gwen, a cool, kick ass Gwen, but not Spider-Gwen).

It's interesting how you pointed out the opportunity for role reversal with MJ, it's something I've wondered about myself and something Ive seen several other fans theorize and post about. It would be a BIG play by Insomniac to have a ""The Night ~~Gwen~~ Mary Jane Died"" arc, but I'm honestly wondering if that's the direction they might take. Everyone knows the story of how Gwen died at this point, its old and trite. This way you'd have a sucker punch of emotional impact, especially because of how great of a character MJ is in this game. Maybe I'm jaded by Game of Thrones, but even at the end of the Heist DLC when Peter and MJ talk about how great of a dad he would be ""with the right person,"" immediately set off alarm bells for the safety of MJ moving forward.

I wasn't surprised by the content, things that happened I've seen in storyline before. New characters felt half expected, half catered because ""these archetypes are popular"".  


I can't think of the character I was going to use as an example, but he was a recurring character that showed up a lot in later seasons. I just remember his speech being very ""meme"" central. Every time he spoke I just cringed a little. I think he was the guy who was initially a bad guy turned good, either a reporter or a rich dude, I can't quite remember. Either way, everytime I heard him speak all I could think was ""You couldn't come up with someone a little more creative? You had to go straight to meme pandering?""  


The whole thing wasn't bad. I especially liked the arc about the first Airbender. However, the series overall just felt very lacking in the creativity and emotional attachment that TLA was able to garnish. The flow of the series certainly didn't catch me up emotionally.

"Stratis already had apps on the Azure marketplace, so this partnership is not about integrating Stratis into Azure. However, the competency they achieved was dependent on the apps they already had on the marketplace:

(Find here under Competency Requirements) [https://partner.microsoft.com/en-lk/membership/isv-competency#simple-tab-content-2](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-lk/membership/isv-competency#simple-tab-content-2)

&amp;#x200B;

This partnership is something which is offered by Microsoft to companies as a way of helping companies who utilise their software ecosystem. In the page linked above, you can also find the benefits which come from succeeding in securing the partnership. These include access to Go to Market services, which is indicative of the reason behind having a Partnership Network in the first place: get the right apps/services to the right customers. Microsoft will be helping Stratis to get their Stratis's BaaS to the people who will want to use it.

&amp;#x200B;

This partnership does not mean that Microsoft is investing in Stratis. The Silver partner and ISV competency are great steps forward for Stratis. Hopefully they can continue down this path and make the most of their position within the Microsoft tech stack.

I also saw that they added in the MA-260. The plane from the Mexico Overhaul.

Also, they just killed the Mexico overhaul because I can't really top this.

But in terms of history:

- no mention of Maximino or the 3 factions.
- Calles getting power back is bad history, which was impossible as he lost all his support in 1935 and it went to Maximino.
- Trotsky being leader is so wrong you might as well have Macho Man Randy Savage by the US president.
- HOLY FUCKING SHIT THEY KNOW ABOUT THE CELIA, AURA, AND SALINAS PLANES. EVEN THE OBSCURE ONE I COULDN'T FIND THE NAME OF.
- The German deal was not oil for tanks, but oil for planes with full technology transfer. Bad history.

That's what I responded it.  Sure, it doesn't actually say ""Left wing violence is fakenews"".... However, the title leads one to believe there is massive amounts of terrorism on the right.  It doesn't mention the left at all.  Those on the Left who have their faces on the news tend to condemn mean words said by people on the right but simply ignore or even justify problem groups like Antifa and BAMN which are far left fringe groups.

I have yet to see/hear someone on the Left actually condemn them rather than sideskirt the actual comments.

No, it does not. Every single time some phenomena has been attributed to a supernatural cause, it has, upon proper examination been found to have a natural cause.

As such for any given phenomena there is no reason to believe in a supernatural cause, making it an un**reason**able belief. Whereas there is reason to believe in a natural cause, making it a reasonable belief.

Look I'm not saying you can't have your faith or whatever, but don't go around proclaiming that it's just as reasonable as *not* believing in magic because it's demonstrably not the case."

"I totally see where you’re coming from, but I’d like to refute. 

A. There’s a reason alcohol and weed (in states where legalized) are restricted to 21 and over. It’s because some kids can’t handle it when given free range, so they have to get rid of it for everyone. Same with social media. Most kids are perfectly fine, but there’s also a lot of cases where people ruin future possibilities by saying stupid stuff without even thinking as a kid. 

B. You can’t hold kids and adults to the same standard. There’s a reason why adults and juveniles are processed differently in courts. Sure, kids are still held accountable, but to a different degree. Scientific studies show that risk taking increases in teens, and it’s common knowledge that teens like to defy authority, all because the brain has yet to develop. 

Again, most kids are perfectly fine on social media, but there’s plenty of cases that probably would’ve benefited the kid had they not had access. "

&gt;Well, I will say [actor] David Mazouz is, without doubt, the best actor ever to play the part of Bruce Wayne. Without doubt — including the people who played Batman. He is a genuine prodigy of an actor, as you will see on screen. Frankly, before David was cast, I was ambivalent about how much we would use Bruce Wayne in the series.

Post Conviction lawyer feels the very same, it didn't happen and the evidence the state presented can not be replicated.

Does the states narrative stand up under scrutiny? Absolutely not! The state can't even keep it's theory in one case the same as the second case, yet people bought into that bogus story.

Substratum Admin Bwolf: “I work for a company with a $2.5 billion market cap. There are several SVP’s that deal with different segments and divisions and believe me neither know what the other is doing in their sector”. 

&gt; Really, So you’re telling me that the SVP of the NCF (which is a pretty high position) is unaware of the NCF’s involvement in cryptocurrency processing and any pending deals. Where do you work again? This means that the CSO Robert Collins acted on his own with this deal and didn’t take it seriously as he didn’t tell any upper level management. 

Here’s the response they claim and so timely released today following this recent outburst with the letter of intent for Substratum’s partnership and the CSO (Robert Collins) dated June 18th 2018. Linked below: 

https://substratum.net/cryptopay/cryptopay-letter-of-intent-from-ncf/

&gt;Why was this not released earlier? Why does Brian Grable SVP of NCF state “The NCF does not have an exclusive agreement with any cryptocurrency provider”? 

Team Response: 
According to admin Bwolf: “Justin said he’s going to have them do a press release or something to that affect. For now on the letter of intent is on the website”. 

This does not add up and looks like a poorly communicated response to a PR outburst. I will look forward to seeing this press release but I doubt it will come to fruition. "

"First of all, you can't seriously be comparing a college admission process with a process where people get cast off a shopping mall often enough for it to be a thing.

Second, no, I would not expect that at all and it's extremely elitist to think that Ivy League students are the best in the country, outliers and all.

Third, the fact that big 3's brand name/money/connections are powerful enough to ensure that any group they debut will instantly be more popular than 80% of other debuting groups means that they can afford to cast below-average people because no one gives a sh\*t how talented they are. Smaller companies have to try to find ways to make their groups stand out in order to compete and one of the ways to do that is to actually build a group with outstanding talents.

Just look at the current most popular GGs. Out of the top 5 new gen groups out there, Gfriend and Mamamoo are far more recognized for their talents (gfriend for dance and mmm for vocals/stage presence) than Twice, RV and Blackpink are for theirs. Guess who belongs to a Big 3 company and who doesn't? Exactly.

Limiting yourself to big 3 groups out of the false belief that they somehow hold the best of the best as far as talent goes is completely nonsensical and all you're doing is losing out on all the greatness that you can find in other places.

"I think he might be a bit better than you are giving him credit for. His all champion damage and main buff equal Celeste's, but he gets two extra multipliers on top of that: Flee and Drop Your Stuff. Granted, Flee doesn't synergize with Strix, but if you go with Birdsong/Zorbu, then the pushback doesn't really matter. For Evelynn, her buff lasts a couple of seconds, and there should be enough time for a new monster to wander into range after a pack gets pushed back.

Unfortunately, despite what I said above, I think the dealbreaker for me is simply the lack of Celeste's ult. In the late game, this is the only viable heal. Unless another champion is released with a percentage heal, Celeste is irreplaceable as far as I'm concerned."

"&gt; I think that the patches that should be released quickly should mostly address things that stop a player from proceeding forward, as in quest fixes, blocker bugs and crash issues. Those bugs generally produce the most frustration because you cannot continue and / or have to stop playing.

Sure, but some of those things you mentioned may not be quick fixes.

What you're really speaking to is a priority list of what they should tackle.  And that's not as easy as it sounds.  First, they have to actually ID the problem and replicate it.  Then they have to figure out how to fix it.  Then they have to figure out how widespread it is, and/or how much of an impact it has.

Something like the Sorcerers Abyssal Claws not doing damage.  It's a stupid bug to be sure.  But it's not game breaking.  You can play the game just fine with it, and if you don't have a Sorcerer character with the Abyssal bloodline, then you won't even SEE the bug.  But if you do...it's glaringly apparent, even if it doesn't actually stop your progression.  

Yet it's a quick fix, so it got hot fixed pretty early on.

&gt; Of course sometimes you'll have a case where a fix causes more bugs somewhere else but after release I think most players would agree they'd rather be playing a stable game - especially something of this size - without having to constantly restart the game or waiting a couple of days for another patch.

I absolutely agree with you here, and I bet Owlcat would agree too.  Fact is, the simple scope of the amount of patches speaks to the fact that this game needed more time before it was released.  But, for whatever reason, we have it now.  What's done is done.  I just hope they can recover from this, because I'd LOVE to see them do more adventure paths like this, now that they have the framework."

/r/piracy in a nutshell /s
"They both operate on pressure. When the propellant (the stuff that's burning) burns, it creates hot, high pressure gasses. The pressure inside the rocket engine pushes equally up against the rocket and down against the gasses themselves as they escape. This pushes the gasses in one direction, rapidly out the bottom, and the rocket in the opposite direction, up. In the case of a bullet, the pressure of the hot gasses pushes equally on the bullet and on the frame of the gun, pressing them both outward. The much smaller and lighter bullet gets moving very fast. Once the bullet exits, the high pressure gasses rapidly escape, which is what produces a large part of the ""bang"" and also the recoil (the gun pushing back against the shooter).

In a way the rocket and gun actually do exactly the same thing, but in the case of the gun, you add a little bit of metal (the bullet) into the metaphorical rocket engine's nozzle to be pushed out along with the exhaust."

"There's no standard ask and bid, concerning barter. With a money economy, negotiation isn't normally necessary, if you want to eat bread, you head to the store and pay the price which everyone who buys bread agrees to.

Money is also fungible and fractional, and in these times with digital currencies, money is the most evenly divisible unit of value *every single time*. Whereas RBEs may involve trades with indivisible commodities like cups or phones. 

Additionally, money can certify the value of any arbitrary good or service. One doesn't have to carry around a boat or even pictures of a boat in a money economy in order to sell the equivalent value. They merely have to carry, give, or receive certificates which reflect the value of that boat."

From ""wow that character didn't work at all"" to ""I won, but not by a comfortable margin"" and ""I feel like hitting the random button to see who I get"".


The point is, is that in a competitive setting the stage is chosen before the characters more often than not (any game after game 1). It makes sense for the stage to be picked first because sometimes a certain stage pick will make a player want to switch characters. "

"I'll just use my honest opinions about why I don't PVP in Feast vs. Frontlines.

It's boring. Team deathmatch modes are the most boring shit ever and not appealing to me in the slightest. Taking feast and making it a pure team deathmatch mode guarantees that I'm not touching it no matter what rewards they put in there. It's creatively dead. I like objective based modes because that requires a bit more strategy and teamwork so usually I'll do a frontlines daily. I try to make it to Rival Wings groups. One of the things I hope for is more objective based modes and less Feast.

The rewards suck. Wow so I can chose between looking like a Dark Souls reject or a LOTR one. How diverse! Meanwhile, there's a bunch of mounts in frontlines that are unique and neat. There's tons of armor sets you can get. (Yes I'm still trying to get the mecha gorilla.)

The netcode is terrible. You know what I like seeing after I do my rotation? It being interrupted because the bard I was targeting moved more than a step or two away. Whoops. Guess I'll just die. In Frontlines, there's usually more people so netcode is more forgiving. I think the current system and GCD we have now translates better towards larger scale combat than 4v4.

The ladder system is quite possibly the worst thing. There's no rank decay if you stop playing so people can just stay there at the rank they want for the whole season and hop off on an alt to smurf (which surprise surprise a lot of the top guys do) to avoid losing on their main. FL doesn't have that nonsense so you can just focus on enjoying the game.

There's no real moderation for cheating. For me this is the biggest one because consistently the cheaters never seem to face bans or punishment. That isn't to say it doesn't exist in FL, but in a competitive/ranked mode that's a big no no.

So why do people play frontlines over feast? It's not as frustrating, it's enjoyable, there's a lot of rewards, and most importantly it's more fun. "
"Interesting, I have almost no experience in the academic world. I'd have thought they used English numbers since they seem to use so many technical terms borrowed from English. I've only heard the year put into Tagalog when only heard it used in religious or state ceremonies.

"Really, if Febri's bodily processes are the same as a normal human's, HC would absolutely be able to heal her. Even if they *weren't* the same, he'd still be able to figure something out.

Academy city absolutely has the technological power to analyse the chemical makeup of those lollipops and HC definitely has the scientific knowledge to be abel to recreate whatever they may be off of that analysis. This arc is so stupid.

If the group of nerds really did try to etch out a place in the dark side of Academy City they'd be eaten alive. Quite possibly literally.

Ponytail Saten continues to be the only redeeming feature of this Arc. Other than Febri cucking Misaka of course.

Why did my subs translate Febri saying ""hamburger"" to meatballs? I mean, I know she was referring to those meatballs she ate last(?) episode, but to translate an english word into something other than what she obviously said? Wut.

Why did HC only tell Misaka about what's going on with Febri? That's not something he'd hide from the other Railgun girls. Other than the part about the dark side of the city ofc. Did Misaka promise that she would tell the others what's going on and then didn't or something?

What is with Misaka Imouto being up and walking outside throughout this arc. In Index we saw she was primarily bedridden after the physical trauma Accelerator dealt to her until at least the Remnant Arc which happens September 14th. The current date of the timeline in this Silent Party arc is somewhere around August 26th. Misaka Imouto should not be able to walk normally for at least another week at least.

Misaka Imouto would not freely reveal that she's a clone to anyone not related to the Level 6 Shift Project or its aftermath. Even if she knew that Febri wouldn't understand what she meant.

More of Kongou acting canon-like.

It's so nice that Misaka is finally learning to trust her friends with some information about what's really going on behind the scenes of this arc. Too bad she'll lose all that character development at the start of the Remnant arc which has already been adapted and thus JC Staff should have known how she develops in the future. Not to mention how much this arc will mess with some characterization in Railgun D if they don't make the correct decision and pretend this arc never happened.

&gt;It's like I haven't grown or something.

Awww. Don't be sad Misaka. It's because you *haven't* grown or something. 

I hate this arc.

Oh good. Misaka finally kept her probable-promise to HC.

&gt;Are there really organizations beyond Anti-Skill's reach.

Oh sweet summer child.

At least the Railgun girls' ability to actually be of use in a serious situation is ""realistic"". Still, Misaka would not have allowed them to help in in the first place at this point in her character arc. Regardless of what this arc tries to tell you or how it has her develop.

Oh please. As I said before, HC would absolutely be able to analyse and recreate those lollipops and would have had it done the night that Febri presented to his hospital.

It would be perfectly realistic in the logic of this series for Anti-Skill HQ to prevent their officers from interfering with a dark side orgaization's work or a shady research experiment, but the work of the group of nerds would not receive that sort of protection. They are nothing and there is no reason that the higherups of the city would protect them like that.

Yomikawa also would not have turned over that ""battery"" to a civilian like that. Even if she disagrees with what Anti-Skill HQ is doing here she still would have turned it over to them as evidence in this police work case. You just haaaaaaad to mess with Yomikawa too, didn't you Nagai. You couldn't at least leave her and Mugino out of this mess.

I mean, it's fairly obvious that Yomikawa is considering Misaka to be with Shirai, a Judgment member, here, but she still did directly hand it to Misaka rather than Shirai. And Misaka is as civilian as you can get.

Did Yomikawa even report that they found that ""battery"" to HQ in the first place? Judging by the fact that she had it in an unlocked desk drawer rather than an evidence locker, I'd say not.

Danggit Nagai, I repeat, the higher ups of Academy City would not protect the group of nerds like this.

The cameras in the area all going down makes much more sense than ""nothing of note"" being recorded on them as Yomikawa stated last episode. Nagai please. Don't have Yomikawa lie like that.

Why would Kongou's father's corporation, which develops aircraft, have a subsection that creates Mechs. This isn't gundam. We haven't seen any evidence that any mechs in this series can fly.

My subs made a translation error when we saw the group of nerds around the table. The female non-Nunotaba nerd didn't say they needed to focus on tuning ""Journey"", she said they need to focus on tuning ""Janie"". Take that as you will.

And now that we learn of Febri's time limit to live, we run into another plot hole. How much of the anti-poison lollipop does Febri need to counteract the poison running through her body? If it's just a little, why not crush what remains of the lollipops and give her the minimum amount to live to stretch out her time as long as possible? There's no way that keeping them in the lollipop form is the best way to give her the ideal amount if they want to keep her alive.

This arc makes me so mad. The writing is so incompetent, the plot is so dumb, and there are holes as far as the eye can see."

"My point is, which I'm sure you know really, is that DNA if only proof of an act, if the collecting and testing isn't corrupt.

In the early days of DNA testing, while many mistakes were made with it's handling and analysis, I don't think there was any corruption.  If cold cases were being reexamined, then DNA would often lead to the offender being identified.  When rape kits were examined, that often either confirmed the person convicted was guilty, or in fact they weren't, as in Avery's case, or a DNA profile was obtained, but that persons profile wasn't on any database for comparison.

Law enforcement used to beat confessions out of people until they were told not to.  If you really don't think anyone in law enforcement would manipulate DNA samples to get someone convicted, that's fine."

"I definitely agree on Kaiserschlacht. The evolving landscape from the scarred earth of the trenches to the largely unscathed town, and finally the open hills of the final sector adds a satisfying element of progression. Same could be said for River Somme. 


I remember an old comment praising the Monte Grappa sector of Iron Walls, something along the line of  ""The grand scale of the mountains and the valleys makes me want to conquer it all"" and I think it was very well put. Iron Walls deserves some love. 


Devil's Anvil also has a special place in my heart, I love the hellscape of Verdun Heights and the fact that it's infantry-only. If the teams are balanced the final sector is always a grind. As for Ft Vaux some people hate the feverish pace and grenade spam once inside but I think the CQC nature of attrition is a ton of fun.

"It took a few months after telling my husband for it to become positive. At first he didn’t believe it, which was invalidating and hurtful. 

But then he started seeing how much the new tools I was using—writing down my routines, getting a weighted blanket, buying some stim toys, etc—how much those things helped me. He started doing things for me like reminding me to use the stim toys when I was wringing my hands (an old nervous stim) and forgot I had them. My favorite thing (I’m sure this would not work for everyone and even be upsetting to some though) was he realized how much the weighted blanket helped me calm down, and when I’m about to start crying from stress/meltdown he figured out that a very tight, deep pressure hug for a few minutes can actually shorten it substantially. 

I’ve tried to tell a few friends but it always gets brushed off. I wish they didn’t do that. I’ve never tried to tell my parents, although they often joke how much like “your friend Sheldon” I am. But it’s great to feel so accepted and understood from at least one important person in my life. "

Everything you think he's doing he's almost certainly not (If you're a strong couple). Don't let thoughts control you, focus on your masters and you will be much happier. Hope this helps. I made the mistake of focusing too much on her and it nearly finished us off. Luckily we caught it before it got too far and we're working to fix things."

"Welcome to being a man. 

Sometimes women can be irrational and work off of their feelings, rather than logic. 

Then, she reacted in a childish manner. In front of the kids. 

You put your foot down and took stewardship over you family’s situation. 

And single parents, especially women, have been raising kids for millennia. A lot longer than the few hours your wife had to take care of the kids alone. That was selfish. 

Granted, kids can be shitty, and we may feel embarrassed by their behavior, but everyone who’s a parent has been there. Seriously, every parent. 

She’ll grow up. 

Remember, you two are a team, and will grow as such, together. This is just a small hiccup in the story. 

But at the same time, nip that behavior in the bud. "

"I hear you man, we should just legalize heroin

Because prohibition obviously works right? People will choose to do these drugs regardless of laws telling them not to, so why not regulate them so the people stuck on them dont get fentanyl because of some shady dealer. Spend the tax money spent of the legal drugs on extensive education on the effects of these drugs. It might not be a quick fix, but long-term this is the best solution. Besides, heroin is already legal with the pharmaceutical industry, it just goes by different names. Statistically, the biggest reason folks make the switch to heroin is because they cant afford the high price of pills. That segues into legal marijuana, but I wont go there because yall understand the point."

"What I absolutely love about this post is that it makes a specific, defensible argument with its title, and then actually succeeds in defending it. Upon opening it, I was expecting a typical ""Discovery sucks"" rant, the sort which we've all seen and which doesn't account for variable taste, and I was pleasantly surprised to have been wrong.

That said, I think there is a certain imprecision in the OP's language that was part of what caused my misconception. I think that the OP has hit upon is more a lack of intellectual or moral *refinement* rather than any form of ""regression."" It is true that presenting high-concept scifi or challenging moral dilemmas is most certainly not Discovery's strong suit as of yet, but I think there it is hardly fair to interpret the characters and setting of the series as inherently lacking in their own morality or intellectualism, certainly not in the same way  the characters on Enterprise were."

"I used to use a cute term I called ""couple look."" It literally just meant that two people looked and interacted as if they were a couple and it didn't matter if they were a couple or if they weren't; it was based on looks and personality and something ineffable. 

A prime example would be Jim and Pam from The Office; a real life example would be if two good friends of opposite sexes with similar tastes and personality and fashion who were really comfortable with each other hung out in public - people would assume they were together unless they looked really hard.

Or you know, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.

That is now ruined because I know the term ""looksmatch"" exists, because it wipes the literally indescribable and cute chemistry friends or lovers may have for each other out and replaces it with a crass description of whether they ""look as attractive as each other.""

On Arena tournament we only see Orc's or Dwarfs... and those picks are chosen because of the racials.

"The market can remain irrational for longer than you can remain solvent.

And yes it has been overvalued for a decade. It's no coincidence that it's also the around same time QE had started. Excess money chasing stocks in a ZIRP environment (because bank deposits, bonds, real estate were seen as less safe with low yields) leads to a bubble. Hence stock valuations has disproportionately diverged from the increase in productive capacity."

"First off, teasing, gossip and the occasional light physical contact aren't bullying. What you just described with that is possibly a friendship or just generally good people playing around with each other. That's not bullying. When it comes to those things a kid has a reasonable amount of control over those things. Bullying is when at no point can a kid say enough and it would be enough.

People aren't against bullying because the kids have a choice of when they can get teased, when the gossiping can slow down or when people will stop the occasional physical contact. People are against bullying...the times where a kid will get picked on constantly whether they want someone to pick on them or not.

Basically...bullying is jehovah witnesses on both acid and speed. Instead of just knocking on your door every now an then when you don't want them to...they incessantly attempt to press every last button you have every chance they get or they'll look for one good button and constantly press that.

Also, adulthood smoothes over just how bad being a kid or teen is because you're both no longer in the state of mind of a kid/teen and you have a certain level of control over your life. So i can understand getting things mixed up a bit but no...bullying does not make better children. Only better human beings can do that."

"It's really good. Lower rates than FEH obviously (comparable to FGO), but still very generous with number of available pulls. Also less new 5\* characters per banner and slower rate of banners in general, which intrinsically means less powercreep. A few different, interesting event styles. Gameplay is fun and has solid depth already. There's enough grinding to feel engaging, without having excessively high expectations. 

Co-op is really fun, as is building your units so you can eventually tackle those quests solo. Both events so far have had a mix of useful stuff at low tiers and a couple higher-end point/grinding rewards to encourage players to use all their stamina. Everything has been accessible to someone F2P if they put in the time, on natural stamina regen alone. 4\* and even 3\* are useful, and events have given some very good rewards like a 4\* unit that actually stacks up to the competition. Basically, I see a lot of good FGO-like elements in terms of the game's structure, and Cygames has a good/player-friendly reputation, especially long-term.

Something to keep in mind is that even though the rate for new characters is lower, it also balances out when you consider the rate of adding new 5\* units, the amount of free pulls you get, and the usefulness of lower-rarity units.

It does have room to grow and improvements to be made, but I think it's in good hands/on a good track for future success. I'm a huge FE fan, put over $200 into FEH in the first week alone, but in comparison it's kinda lost its appeal for me over time."

Yep true story. The problem with everyone having his chart and reading it in his own way is that you never know who will turn out to be right. This last run-up has lasted months although it appears to be almost a vertical line. The same argument could have been made since $25 and people would still have missed the 33% increase to $34. Or maybe it could have lasted to $42. The problem is with reproducing these predictions with accuracy.

"Been watching Westerns the past week in anticipation. Saving *The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly* for tonight (my favorite Western).

Watched *Unforgiven* last night. I had seen it when I was younger but didn't fully appreciate. Not the best ""Western"" but probably the best ""film"" out of movies taking place in the old West. The script and how the film plays out is just incredible - such a masterpiece.

Other fun films worth checking out:

* *The Great Silence*: not amazing, but fairly unique as most of it takes place in the snow and the hero uses a Mauser.
* *For a Few Dollars More*: less complex than the other Sergio Leone Westerns, but Lee Van Cleef just shines.
* *Once Upon a Time in the West*: a lot of critics argue it's the best western, and that it's better than Good/Bad/Ugly (I don't agree, but it indicates the quality)
* *Hang 'Em High*: more appropriate before playing RDR than RDR2, a great revenge Western"

"Interesting read .. I often think of James Hansen's 'Storms of my Grandchildren' when I read articles like this

&gt;Meteorologist Ryan Maue of WeatherModels.com tweeted that **the storm would be a ""Category 6 if Atlantic scale was extrapolated"".**

&gt;**""This is an historically significant event,""** tweeted Michael Lowry, a hurricane specialist with the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.

&gt;The National Weather Service's advisory for the islands conveyed a dire message, **warning of ""devastating damage"" from the ""collapse of residential structures,"" partial or total destruction of industrial and apartment buildings, and loss of water and electricity for days to weeks.**

&gt;In addition to winds that will flatten structures and forests, **a storm surge as high as six metres is possible in the hardest-hit coastal locations. Storm surge acts as a storm-driven tsunami, and the six metres of surge doesn't count battering waves.** Rainfall approaching or surpassing 30 centimetres is likely to also lead to freshwater flooding and landslides.

&gt;It's a classic and absolutely textbook storm on satellite, resembling a buzz saw. **You don't see them much more intense.**"

"&gt;If I do not want to eat or am not hungry when he wants me to eat (eg if I’ve been snacking before a meal, or even am just having a hard day and can’t eat), he will become angry and threaten punish me (usually by just not spending time with me, nothing drastic) because he’s “upset with me.”

I'm sorry, but what?? He threatens to ""punish"" you when you don't eat what he thinks you should eat? And his punishment is basically ignoring you (which is actually fucking drastic BTW - and abusive - but I can already tell you will vehemently deny it).

So this is a HUGE red flag, but there's more. 

&gt; I feel manipulated that he is trying to trick me into eating the amount that he wants me to eat by eating a lot himself. 

Red flag.

&gt;BF has expressed to me that he does not want to be eating as much as “I am making him” because he is stressed about gaining weight himself.

You're making him? Really? Red flag.

&gt;it’s incredibly concerning that he is upset with me, personally, when I don’t meet the standards he has set for my food consumption.

Red flag.

&gt;It makes me feel like he views my eating disorder or my inability to perfectly recover 100% as a personal shortcoming or something that I deserve to be punished for.

Back to him think your deserve punishment for not meeting his standard. Red flag.

&gt;His anger with me for not always fulfilling the requirements he has set (not requirements that a therapist or doctor has set)

Red flag.

&gt;puts unnecessary strain on our relationship and takes away my sense of agency.

Red flag.

He is not trying to help you recover. He is trying to control you. Someone who cares about you doesn't threaten to ignore you/withdraw affection if you don't do what they tell you to. I know you are going to absolutely refuse to see that now. I hope therapy will help you."

"I'm sorry if my replying to you in a thread blatantly about coding as art offended you, but no, I did not ""start taking chunk of comments out of context"". I quoted what I thought were the key points of your reply. If I misinterpreted your reply, fine, my mistake. But please don't claim that there's some hidden deeper meaning in your reply.

I also quoted parts that I thought were irrelevant to the discussion at hand - is coding art - and instead talk about how it's difficult or how many of us code at what we might call a basic level.

And thanks for completely missing my point about the level of art. It's not that I think every single piece of code should be enshrined in the Louvre, but that this ""write to the level of art"" thing is subjective and arbitrary. Of course we're not all going to be Michaelangelos of code, but my point is that such coding *does* exist, and that coding itself can, very easily, be artistic."

"I've worked in both discount department store retail and high end retail.

The average high end retail customer is *significantly* nicer.  I really didn't expect that.  Almost every customer that came in those doors was nicer than 80%+ of the people I interacted with in the department store. The *really* nice ones would affect my outlook on life to this day.

In the department store when there was a big sale trailer trash would come in on the last day, get pissed off that the item was sold out and would demand we look in the stockroom even thought I was 110% sure the last item was sold two days ago.   Some will straight up call you a liar and demand to speak to the manager if you don't go check.... *Then* they'll demand you call every other store in the province for their $30 item.

 Nothing you do will be good enough and everything you say is a lie.  You can be earning a university degree and doing this to make some cash to help pay tuition and be treated like you're subhuman of by a person whose *career* is working part time at a different retail store while collecting government assistance.

At the high end place I had some of the country's richest people treat me like an equal.  They would ask a question and would fully trust your judgement.  Then they would thank *me* for helping them spend their money even when I felt I didn't do anything out of the ordinary.

The bad ones could get pretty bad and the worst ones were people that couldn't afford to shop at the store and would make your life miserable over a $20 item.  It was like they were playing rich based on how rich people are portrayed in movies."

He backpedeled and read the manga and whatnot before declaring it to be mediocre, but I really doubt that he still wasn't shaken by the first episode's controversial scene.

"You're talking about corporatocracy, not corporatism. The term corporatism in its proper usage and in the context of fascist economics doesn't refer to the rampant corruption we see today with corporate entities (businesses) influencing politics. I've posted a brief description of what economic corporatism actually entails:

""At it's heart, corporatism is driven by a pursuit of wealth for all society. It does this through class cooperation, allowing people to have pay disparities and get rich, but not allow people to remain poor or use their wealth for negative reasons. This is accomplished through an A-Z pay scale, where one cannot earn less than A, but cannot earn more than Z either. In this way, economic incentive is maintained, as one can climb up the economic ladder, say, from G-&gt;H.

To keep this cooperation in check, corporatism uses courts to dictate resolutions between the workers and employers when disputes arise. These resolutions are binding to both parties, and are government meditated. As such, there are no unions in Corporatism, as these government courts are used to settle the disputes, avoiding the need for strikes, etc. Responsibility is hence shared by employers and workers.

Free enterprise in corporatism also stands in difference from capitalism. In capitalism, companies and capitalists are free to do almost, and in certain cases, absolutely whatever they want. They pay off corrupt elected officials and act in this own interests. This is not tolerated in corporatism, and companies are only free to act in the realm the state allows, as in, they act in accordance to public interests. Effecting this is the active government participation in economics under corporatism. The government actively directs and coordinates the economy for the best interests of the country. Say a war starts, so the government directs factories to start building tanks, and food companies to start making rations. In this way the state commands the economy, but only when it is necessary."""

"Scorpio season is from October 23 - November 21. 

Scorpio is the 8th sign of the Zodiac. It’s represented by a Scorpion. 

It rules the 8th house in Tropical Astrology. The 8th house represents death, rebirth, taboos, sex, inheritance, wills, and other peoples money, and the occult. The house of mysteries.

Scorpio is ruled by the planets Pluto and Mars. Pluto was the God of the Underworld, Pluto is the planet of personal transformation, power struggles, death, rebirth, and spiritual growth. It’s a very spiritual and mystical planet.

Mars is the planet of personal energy, which can include sexual energy and desires, aggression, anger, primal instincts and survival instincts. Basically war and sex.

Scorpio is a fixed feminine water sign. 

Fixed energy is maintaining energy. It keeps the status quo and doesn’t like change. 

Feminine energy is receptive, seductive, introverted, feeling, sensing, nocturnal, and a “negative polarity,” (yin) it’s absorbing and pulling.

Water energy is very emotional, intuitive, sensitive, and nurturing. Emotions run deep like an ocean it’s ultra-sensitive.

All of these together make up the general “feel” of the Scorpio zodiac.

That is the actual astrological meaning of Scorpio. 

Now the pop cultural stereotypes of Scorpio (whether true or not) tend to be:

-Vindictive and revengeful 
-very dark kinky, as in BDSM
-witchy or occultic
-obsessed with death or masochism
-manipulative and deceptive 
-gold digger/black-widow
-psychopathic

The memes generally tend to be based off these pop culture stereotypes, even though these stereotypes may not accurately represent all Scorpio’s to the same degree.

"People don't play safe *because* it's frustrating for them to do so.

The general 'guiding star' for HotS players 'If it's red, the game wants me to kill it.'

Ever seen a hammer/medic duo in QM push top lane? The vast majority of solo laners up against them will get mad, push out, try to kill hammer, and die. *Almost no one* will passively soak, let them trash the wall and even the fort, and pray that the four man either counter-pushes or ganks. Almost no one.

I have *literally been ping spammed* as the solo laner while correctly passively soaking. I have chat turned off, but I'm sure the person spamming me wanted me to 'do something about hammer and morales'.

People just don't understand the game beyond 'kill stuff'."
"I’ll admit I’ve paid for cosmetic changes in Borderlands, and you’re right. It doesn’t change the play of the game, it’s just digital clothes for your digital action figure. But in those games where you can spend real cash (GTA5 Online or DCUO, for example), the kid with rich parents and a wide open schedule can buy his way to high powered weapons without actually working (grinding) and earning his weapons; versus the guy who works full time and only has six-eight hours a week to devote to playing the game. The kid will be level 100 in a matter of days, whereas the adult with a job and a family won’t see 100 for months. He might also not make enough to buy a Shark Card in GTA, which becomes in game currency, but the kid with no responsibility is either cadging his parents’ credit cards or using his allowance to buy tanks and attack choppers and night clubs. 

This was part of the scandal with the latest Star Wars Battlefront, buying loot boxes with random weapons in them using real currency to purchase in game monies. Cosmetic changes don’t hurt the player with a life or less money, whereas gameplay perqs can ruin someone else’s experience and make them not want to play.

"""No damage""  
When it comes to freezing and below, damage is possible with **inked pens** when the ink is allowed to freeze, since water expands, and water trapped when it's already frozen at the nib unit will expand out towards the barrel, section, or converter/piston which can cause cracks.   


Deep in a backpack or next to your persons during trips is usually kept insulated from being completely frozen.    


But yes, condensation from temperature change as well as ink burping (mostly from eye dropper filled, or vintage sac pens) is a high possibility with temperature change, same deal with coming in from a hot summer day into a very chilled office building (... wonder why no one asks about pen damage when it's like over 100F outside).

Just like male ones. Pure and utter SHIT. Just because they CRY doesn't make them better. Any fucking spoiled kid can cry, if it doesn't get its way.

When I read stuff like that I pray for asteroids.
"Diane's impulsiveness is a character trait which informs her actions throughout the story, but this is not really the ""subject"" of her current development. More like a circumstance, really. It wouldn't make any sense for her to act *less* impulsively while unrelated epiphanies and interpersonal issues are piling on her.

I think the storyline did a decent job showing how Diane's attention moved from the mall incident and its direct consequences to focus on her relationship with Lucy, by way of questioning their dating habits. Remember how opposed she was to the idea of confronting her father? It makes sense to give her some breathing space on that angle, and show instead how those events have impacted her in other, less direct ways. Yes, the momentum is lost, but Diane not taking it in stride is kind of the whole *point*.

On a general level, I agree with you about the pacing issues and conflicting priorities between plot threads. This is something I have already complained about, at length. I just don't see the current storyline as adding more garbage to the pile, but rather as part of the process of going through all the pending ""plot material"".

I also get what you're saying about social issues, and how they are being conveniently sidelined when everyone is playing nice and/or turning out to be attracted to one another. When it comes to Lucy, though, I don't think she was ever actually intended as homophobic. Rhoda noticed her hostility and misinterpreted it as prejudice, but some people have been suspecting for a while that it was actually jealousy."

I was wondering about this as well. I thought maybe that unless both players had the DLC of Red Rock Park maybe it would not allow games there. That would be a bad idea because I can’t think of a better way to market downloading the Park than to let players who don’t have it see what they are missing.

"Both are pretty bad. I don't see what the point is in getting wrapped up between the minor details of which one is worse. That being said, being a college student, there are plenty of functional coke users here which makes me think its not nearly as bad as crack, meth, and heroin. "
Uncharted. Bought the first one a few years after it came out and it didn’t really click so I never finished it. My friend lent me U2 saying it was better than the first but I never really tried it. When Uncharted 4 was coming out I picked up the Nathan Drake trilogy for like $20 and powered through and loved them. Uncharted 4 was great too. 
"I recently created two teams full of All-Stars from both the base SMB2 game, and of real MLB All-Stars.

The SML All-Stars were created by taking the top player at each position, and filling out the bench with the best remaining players. I used [this spreadsheet for reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17QDJDQpFcKtxvo0cbv2GQ-0SLJnssvdBCMAGjowUOlc/edit#gid=2002889516), and recreating them exactly from the default rosters. Man this game could really use a ""Copy Player"" function.

The MLB All-Stars were created the same way, but using ratings from MLB The Show 18 as a base.

This was a pretty solid game to watch, (except my boy Mike Trout going 0-5) but the MLB manager made some straight-up terrible decisions. Batting in the 8th with a 1-run lead, and a runner on 1st (after pinch-hitting J.D. Martinez for Buster Posey), the game let Dellin Betances hit for himself to end the inning. He then goes back out to pitch the 9th, after pitching a pretty shaky 8th. He then proceeds to give up a game-tying solo shot on the first batter, and then one out later finishing the game by giving up a 3-run, pinch-hit, walk-off homer to Yatter. All this with Hader, Miller, and Jansen left in the bullpen. Other than that, both AI managers made some pretty smart pinch-hit, and defensive substitutions.

Overall though, I'm so glad /u/MetalheadSoft added the ability to watch AI games. Maybe I'll run a few more simulations to try and get different starting pitcher match-ups."
"That is certainly a way to improve it.

But how much of those people move there to get better wages and escape thwir own anti-prostitution laws?

Maybe the conclusion is that richer countries in the EU should not legalize prostitution due to Schengen and its regulations.

Fair enough, as I said, not every society is ready for it. But if all of Europe is roughly at the same development stage or if the EU did not exiat and we would be talking about only single countries like the Netuerlands or Germany, wouldn't prostitution be okay?"

"&gt;The so what about it is the outcome that could’ve happened. He could’ve extinguished a life that can never be brought back. 

I think you've completely failed to read the part where I said ""even murderers can be rehabilitated""

&gt;That would make murder quite the profitable business if for instance I offered to kill a high value individual for a very very large sum of money and then just served my twenty fiver years or so then got out because I’m “rehabilitated.”

Not really. Say you commit your first murder at 21 years old. You get paid $100,000. You get arrested and your money is taken from you. You now have no money and must serve 25 years in jail. You get out at 46 years old, more like 47 years after court times. Commit another murder, another $100,000, another year in court then another 25 years. You're now 73, have no money, no pension, and have spent half a century in a cell. You're dying and have done nothing with your life except waste tax payer money and end two lives.

Hardly a profitable industry is it?"

"Define ""hasn't carbonated"".  No ""pfft"" at all when he opens a bottle?  Or just not to his desired carbonation level?  Did he add bottling sugar (and mix it in) before bottling? 

I would routinely see mine take 1-2 months to get to a decent carb level (mostly high gravity) and would speed mine up by putting them in my fermentation fridge and cranking the temp up to 80-85.  The few I had issues with carbing, I just added CBC-1 to without sugar and waited another 2-3 weeks, but I knew I had the proper amount in to start with.  I would caution him on creating bottle bombs but if there is no carb at all at this point, he probably needs to add (boiled, cooled, dissolved) sugar as well.

Have him get a big garbage bag and put his bottle cases into that and loosely tie the top.  I always did that as a precaution to something blowing.  Now I keg and life is wonderful."

"&gt; So just so we are all clear, this stat is yards of separation at time of reception, not time of throw. So it's more than a little misleading when it comes to the cowboys receivers. Dak is a SITI QB so he tends to throw when he sees someone open, which is fine when you have the time for people to get open.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem with this stat is that type of throw affects the the stat in question. If you throw it after a receiver comes out of their break on a hitch, you are giving the defender time to regain the ground that they lost on the break. This is why Qbs are supposed to throw either at the break or right before, maximizing the distance and time a receiver has before the defender recovers.

this is the reason I hate making assesments  on stats alone they very rarely tell the true, or whole story. "

"&gt; Which isn't tied at all to race.

Exactly.

&gt; So the discrepancy between the city demographics vs. demographics of the council are fair to question.

Not really. There is no reason to expect to see uniform demographics in all things. The NBA being disproportionately black, for instance, doesn't imply we should panic or worry that the teams won't perform adequately unless they make a concerted effort to recruit more white people.

&gt; Think of it this way, if the council was solely made up of ""gay Asian men in their twenties that were born in Paris"", would you feel potentially not well represented?

No. Because the demographics of the people who represent me don't matter. As you yourself said, none of the relevant factors in their ability to do their job are tied to race, or, by extension, any other identity politics quality. "

And you don't need to be a health professional to know how to treat and handle food. Pretty much every cook in every decent restaurant does this. You know how to look at food, tell if it's off, and take appropriate precautions to prevent infection.

Is this a 100% guarantee? No, but nothing is or ever will be. Even if you burn your food to charcoal, there is still *some* possibility that it will get infected before it gets into your stomach, perhaps by the person sitting next to you and *breathing* in your vicinity.

"If by ""Randian view,"" you mean, ""Does Objectivism have a stance on clandestine marriage,"" then the answer is no. The Objectivist view would be to use reason to come up with an answer. It's important to remember that Objectivism lays out general philosophical principles. It is up to you to apply those principles.

I would venture to say that this is more in the realm of philosophy of law, which is a specialty topic not covered by general philosophy (ethics, politics, etc.)

To give my personal thought on the topic; marriage is primarily a legal term. A clandestine marriage without government backing has no legal standing unless a state has ""common law"" marriage legislation. Sure, you can call yourself ""married,"" if you want to, but I think that its primary usage is and should be regarding a contractual, legally recognized relationship.

There have been comments in this thread about ""disillusionment"" with marriage. This doesn't have anything to do with marriage itself as a concept; it has everything to do with the individuals involved. Sure, many people aren't cut out for the massive amount of effort and communication skills that long-term relationships require. Marriage works for some people and not for others. 

Marriage doesn't have to mean big ceremony, and it doesn't even have to have government involvement. But if you want the legal protection and status of ""marriage"" as it generally means, there should be some sort of legal standard that is recognized. I personally don't think that marriage complicates relationships if you know exactly why you want it and what you're getting into. If you don't plan on being with someone for a lifetime, don't get married.

Don't get confused about the concept of marriage because culturally we have all of these silly traditions. You're not obligated to do any of those things except go to the courthouse and get a marriage certificate. And even then, you're not required to do that if you don't care about the legal benefits."

"Yea, this is some kind of a problem. If a player harshly tackles you without even getting the  ball andu try your best to dodge it but fail to catch up to the ball because of it, it usually won't be a foul. But if you ride the tackle and roll about, then the ref would give it. Both involves a player being reckless and impeding a goal scoring opportunity, but the reaction of the other player changes the view of the ref.

I don't like it, but if it's like this, I see why some players do it. Of course it gets worse when some players try to do this when nothing actually happened.."

"&gt;So after being active for 4 months. I have got a great Idea of Controversial topics..
1) Black Panther is the best MCU solo film
2)Shuri is smarter than Bruce Banner and Tony Stark
3) Falcon should be the next Captain America
4) Captain Marvel is the most powerful MCU Superhero
5) Zendaya is a version of MJ
6)Do we need a Black Widow film?
7)Brie Larson is the bad casting choice for Captain Marvel.

Oh I'll have a go why not
1. I think to each thier own.  This last year to me was the strongest.  As a solo film I'd have it near the top.  No one is wrong.  Except fans of thor 2 as thier favorite.  
2. I don't like shuri as the absolute smartest.  I think they gave banner and Tony smarts but they are different smarts.  They play off each other.  I just didn't love shuri being smart and banner dumb.  They easily could have put something like,  his response to be,  we didn't have time there's always avenging to do. Also puts genius parker as kinda  meh. Theyll do the same with amadeus cho. Make him smarter than shuri. There is lots of ways to be smart. 
3.i like falcon.  They would need to beef him up a little with some mcguffin. Him as cap would work. Also, i would love a falcon and ant-man teamup. I would hate to see the comic costume of falcap.  Blech 
4. Is she? I like thor, God of thunder being strongest and even now he's almost op. If she's stronger than it starts to put her in the superman conundrum.  I would like her to whack Tony around a bit. 
5. I think i would have been happy with her as gwen stacy or any number of other girls.  I think zendaya is great and is a great addition.  That character wasn't  Mary Jane. It wasn't even gwen stacy.  I can't imagine  zendaya saying,  face it tiger you hit jackpot.  That isn't just a catch phrase but really encapsulated her attitude and spirit and playfulness.  Zendaya and Tom have great chemistry.  Just play off that.  Probably could have been strong enough that soon a zendaya character would have been in the comics. 
6. Yes.  We've needed it for years.  Before all other of scar joes movies were cheap knock offs.  Down and gritty and well planned spy caper.  
7. Do people say she is a bad choice? I trust in marvel casting.  If they said they were putting yahoo serious in a marvel movie, I'd be like... well ok then."

"You keep saying things that have nothing to do with what I said.

Forcing other people to adhere to arbitrary rules is pretty much the definition of oppression.

Again, I have 0 problems with christians (or muslims or any religion) following their own weird rules. That's totally fine. It only becomes a problem when they try to discriminate against others based on those rules. And that is certainly not a just society. You have very weird definitions for justice and oppression.

I'm not a muslims. Muslims have no right to tell me to pray in direction if Mecca or what I can draw. 
I'm not a christian. Christian have no right to tell me that  I can only have sex within a marriage or who I'd like to marry.
Same applies to Buddhism, taoism, paganism or whatever. If I'm not a member of your special club then your special rules don't apply to me.

The fact that religious people like to think that their rules should apply to OTHERS is the hight of privilege most arrogant.

"It's not logically inconsistent, but it is rationally inconsistent with respect to how we should approach *societal* problems.  When we are thinking about societal problems (not personal preferences), we need to apply a consistent schema for determining value.

Take your second example.  Let's say a parent is on a school board in a far-away land. They are tasked with distributing funding between different schools.  The problem is that there are two races in this land, A and B.  The parent is of race A.  Is it okay for the parent to allocate more funding for schools of A-race children?  No, even if their *personal* preferences are to give more money to their own race.

In the same way, we might personally like dogs more than pigs, say.  But when it comes to forming decisions on factory farms, (and when considering the iherent rights of different animals), our personal preferences should be set aside. (Because it is a societal problem.)

That's not to say that, if you are going to get a pet that you should give equal preference.  A pet is a personal concern.  The welfare of a large group is a broader concern, a deserves an impartial analysis."

The UC system raising wages is a band-aid fix and the protest is ultimately selfish, since they're basically protesting for a raise, and when anybody eventually leaves or gets fired, they'll just be back to awful convenience store jobs with less wages and benefits than the UC system offers. Ultimately all they're doing is turning public opinion against them by throwing a hissy fit to get the UC system's attention instead of actually protesting to the right people. I'm sick of this whole ""let's just inconvenience passerby to get attention to our cause"" instead of actual protesting towards the people who make these decisions."

The mutation appeared in the 50's, and largely fell out of favor through the 90's. Selective breeding caused them to re-emerge in the show ring. Flat faced persians do better in the show ring, but apparently regular people show a preference for a more normal/older head shape.

Interestingly, with cats it seems the breed issues are often reversed from dogs. Conformance standards have driven a lot of the fucked up dog breeds (German Shepherds), while for cats it seems to have been more the nature of faddish owners (munchkin-breeds, cauliflower-ear)."

They took my weight and i've dropped 10 pounds in the past week (currently 161 pounds at 6'2; started at 185) Now, instead of just pancreatitis, they're worried that it's something more serious since 10 pounds in 7 days is just not normal.

That being said, my blood is currently being tested for every known metabolic test under the sun, and they're hoping that one of those tests tells us what's wrong with me. I've also made an ASAP appointment with a gastroenterologist for this Friday

What i'm trying to get at, is that today was a really gloomy day for me, and i'm just happy that i can chill in this subreddit and talk hoops with everyone. It's been my escape from a reality i dont wanna face.

Obama didn’t de prioritize right wing terror threats when the FBI confirmed a spike in it.  Trump stupidly called to reduce budget for investigation into right wing threats acting as if Islamic terrorism was the only thing to worry about.  So yes our moron President both through his tone and actions is emboldening right wing extremists.

"Right, but there IS other stuff to do to make more money. They'll obviously change it, but this seems like a good start.

The problem arises that ""he"" doesn't want to use someone elses ship to make money. But that's how it's going to work. The gameplay is the same, whether you haul cargo in my freelancer or your own, so you don't get to complain about the gameplay. It's just that it's not ""your"" ship. You'd be doing the EXACT same thing if it were your ship though, and that's somehow ok?

No.


Heck I just got chased away from a 25% laranite rock by just a stinkin buccaneer AI. Easy prey for an aurora, even my prospector hurt it a bit before I got bored and ran away. I'd have paid someone 15k to be saved from that.


The mission money will probably go up some, but hopefully not a lot. The REAL problem here is homeboy don't wanna do XYZ in someone elses ship, but totally fine doing it in his own. No fam. No. This is how you create community and economy. It's also how you ensure people have a desire to NOT be dicks to each other. How else will you earn your first big ship if no one likes/trusts you."

"That’s what I was thinking. The talk about how her Grandfather wants some more artwork, her poor little dog sleeping in a blanket, and a coffee drink... I thought they could be speaking to her, but those items are all so normal and innocent — also child-like. I thought, maybe, they were presenting her in that way to target someone who had taken her who was harming her and remind them this is just a very young girl with a family that misses her. Additionally, perhaps, they were also reminding the public of that to quell potentially inappropriate theories. Or, to get more eyes on this case and caring about this girl. There’s so much speculation, in my opinion. It was unusual and felt odd, but I don’t know why."

Appreciate the feedback!  I love creating any enemy that uses laws and what not to their advantage.  Or also creates scenarios where combat isn't always the best option.  However I just don't want the majority of scenarios to always be that way. Sometimes the players just need a cut and dry combat.  Which is why I am looking for a reasonable way to put caps on skills.  Honestly was just curious as well to see if anyone has actually implemented a system that works.

And that’s not the point. I believe it’s interesting because an artist in a completely different genre named a grunge rock band as his favorite band. He could’ve said the Wu-Tang Clan, A Tribe Called Quest, Tupac, etc. as his favorite “band” but instead, he chose a band that is completely different and separate from a lot of the modern popular interests of today’s music scene. That’s why I thought it was cool and noteworthy — because it was something I personally didn’t expect while reading about Lil Wayne’s career. But because you apparently know everything, and what you say is law, makes it uninteresting. You could have started a constructive conversation about why you think it shouldn’t be a surprise a band so successful is influencing even the most unrelated artists of this generation, but you instead decided to be, frankly, a dick.

"I found the answer myself. You were talking about how 2FA encrypts messages between users, but that's not how 2FA works. It looks like whatever you installed also allows for optional encrypted messages between users, but that's different than what 2FA does. 

Of course, there's no way for the end user to know whether or not messages are actually encrypted on the server end, but I'm curious about the optional encryption for messages between users. If a user has encryption enabled and tries to send a message to user who doesn't have encryption enabled, will the message go through? If so, and if there's no alert, that's a pretty serious security vulnerability.

Also, if the message encryption is optional and if it's not enforced when sending messages between enabled and not-enabled users, I wouldn't feel confident that the checkbox actually does anything at all. As far as the user can tell, it's just a checkbox that may or may not have functionality. Any thoughts on that?"

"No. There are rules about names. The pope has to change his. When a catholic kid (around 10th grade) gets ""confirmed"" you have to chose a christian name. If your name is something like krystal, ryleigh or shanequa you need to choose a new christian name like catharine or julia. Just to note, no one who goes does the confirmation has to change their legal name at all. But in the case you become a nun or a priest you take on the chosen christian name. My old fathers name as joseph, but had to change it it (to his chosen name) anthony to become a priest even though his orignal name as as christian as you can get. I dont follow catholics so much anymore, but I think the current popes origninal name was joseph too."

"You know what? ""Thrice is enemy action""

What self-respecting actual terrorist / Nazi / whatever would send a half a dozen bombs or more and have none of them go off?

One bomb failing, pff, terrorists are not well in the head, so they probably produce shoddy stuff. Two bombs failing, well, see the previous point. Accident. Half as likely, but okay, they are dumb terrorists. Coincidence. Three bombs not going off? Now we're getting into seriously unlikely probabilities. Four? Five? Six not going off? Impossible to be a coincidence. 

They were not meant to go off or couldn't. Absolutely stupid terrorists, and I doubt we're that lucky - or false flag. "

"I know a couple who continued to live with each other even after a break-up because of financial reasons. There was a lot of tension at first, and they couldn't stand each other. But ultimately they got around those issues and managed to get along. However, they're back with each other now. 

I don't know much about Mark and Ethan. However, I've been to both Bloomington, Indiana and Los Angeles. The two cities couldn't be more different. Bloomington was very homey and welcoming (and gay friendly for Indiana). LA was fake and pretentious. I can imagine how such a move would impact their relationship. They might be in a breakup-rekindle phase where they're together one moment, but sorta' broken up another. I don't know. The West Hollywood gay scene brings out the worst in people. 

In any case, I wish them both the best. Being a couple on social media is daunting because you have to pretend to be in love, even when you're in a fighting phase, or in a bad place. Not only that, but people expect you to behave in a certain way. Ethan has recently been experimenting with non-confirming gender identity, but I can imagine that, after being a ""bro"" for so long on YouTube, it's hard to come out as non-binary. People want to see his cute blond face and his abs, not his make-up skills.

"True, more girls go to college than boys. But boys still make more money. Many careers that were traditionally female and continue to be primarily female are requiring more and more advanced degrees. In some states, you are legally required to have two masters degrees to be a high school teacher, even though teachers aren’t paid very well. This is not true of many traditionally male careers. Web design, a newer male-dominated career, does not require a degree at all. For many of these positions, you just need to be able to prove that you can do the work. The average starting salary for a web designer is twice that of the average starting salary of a teacher.

The data you linked to is from 2015, and I can’t find a study that says the same. Most 2018 studies say that women’s wealth is on average significantly lower than men’s (about 1/3 of the total wealth), that more women are living in poverty during retirement, and that women are generally making less money than men.

That being said, there are aspects of American public education that are definitely more beneficial to women than men. Even with women benefiting from these aspects, men are still statistically more successful financially. Since money influences power and politics, and since women make enough less that it’s statistically significant, they experience oppression."

"Maker's Mark is especially useful with the most difficult crafts since they give a lot of steps for Maker's Mark. The less difficult recipes don't give many steps so it is not useful with them. Also the useful thing about MaMa is that as it has a lot of steps without CP spending, there are a lot of chances of getting good condition so Whistle While you Work will be a very useful CP gaining ability.

The best crafters don't like Maker's Mark because it makes crafting an item very long and avoid it if possible. But for a casual crafter that does not craft many items it is useful for a specialist with Whistle.

Muscle Memory gives a nice advance in the craft, helping a bit in any craft you do which is difficult.

Anyway you will want to level all classes up so it is not that important. Best level all about the same pace, since they need mats from one another."

"No, but I know what works for me. 

Faith is like a force of nature, it appears in history form time to time and alters everything before it in vast waves, for good or ill. 

Religion is just the story of faith. Personally I believe that there is one divine being, but I can see that my understanding of something that exists outside of time and outside of our basic understanding of physics would confound anyone. Perhaps the Prophets were just humans who had an encounter with an infinite being and who were desperately trying to relay some element, some fragment of that fundamental Truth that they were able to grasp for that fleeting moment that our finite and limited minds could understand.

I do have deep doubt, but that is not the opposite of faith, but its source. If you have proof of god's existence, there would be no faith, just facts. This is the same reason fanatics and atheists both lack faith, theirs are worlds of fact. Without doubt to be overcome, faith is meaningless. The divine is not something that is known, but something that is felt. Take your pick of the tradition that enables you to feel that experience. It's all a way of communing with a part of reality that does not bow to reason."

Those are your words trying to draw that similarity, not mine.  So try to stay on topic and just say that you don't care about our laws as long as you agree with the outcomes.

She sometimes has a rope loop on his harness that she uses when she makes him pull her in her wheelchair but that is the closest I have seen to a leash. 

Additionally, she would rather video/photograph the encounter then remove her life-saving dog from harms way. There was a previous video where she was confronting someone with a dog in the store that she was claiming was lunging and aggressive towards Colt. I would have thought the first priority was to try to remove Colt from the situation to ensure his and her own safety but she preferred to try to capture the encounter on film.

"Yeah right now actually. Well kinda. I was fucking this bird for a couple of months and recently it seemed to go to shit.

She texted a few days later saying she hasn't got back with him and all that. 

The whole are we aren't we thing comes from the fact that we're always out in a group. Like I said my cousin is good friends with her and her sister is going out with my friend. My family thinks I'm going with her because my cousin or her friend probably let what happens between us when we're out. We had a sexual relationship alright and get on well but I'm not sure if it's over. We're all meeting up for drinks again this weekend  and me and her are talking again so we'll see what happens.

"Me, the equally clueless brother: is it like the engine or something? 

I’ll let her know to check the blinder fluid. Thanks man "
Yup.
"&gt; ...No, they couldn't. If you look at the very early SRs they go into detail as to why. The engine simply couldn't do what DayZ was supposed to be and that makes sense. Arma 2 and 3 were not meant to hold the amount of players, entities, and systems that DayZ SA has and plans to have in the future.

This is only true when you define ""what DayZ was supposed to be"" by the overly-ambitious bloated mess that DayZ snowballed into when Dean Hall decided they wanted to completely reinvent the wheel.  When you scale back all the feature creep, overly complex systems, and completely unrealistic goals and scope that they came up with it would have been much more reasonable to optimize and improve upon the already existing mod.  Hell, the community devs fixed a *lot* of the problems that 2012 DayZ Mod had and it's a much better running game now than it used to be and that's with all sorts of limitations imposed on them.  Dean's original code for the mod was spaghetti code and if they'd reworked it as well as gone with the *original* idea of simply stripping out all the unnecessary ArmA tech such as soldier AI that was bogging DayZ Mod down they could have come up with something much more playable and optimized that people would have been happy to pay money for and sink hours and hours into playing.  They brought the necessity of rebuilding the entire engine from the ground up on themselves by being too ambitious and wanting too much out of the game for what current tech could offer.

&gt; Comparing the two is ludicrous and I don't even know why you thought that was a good comparison to make.

I wasn't comparing the engines side by side, I was comparing the business model.  CS was a pretty bare bones mod that people loved to play and they pushed that bare bones mod straight to retail which was the smart move.  BI should have taken the 1-2 years to polish the mod like they originally said they would and sold it.  People would have played the hell out of it even with the inherent bugs like light penetrating walls and been more than happy to buy DayZ 2 a few years later on a new and improved engine.  We literally would be playing DayZ 2 by now and it would be way better and more feature complete than the current dumpster fire that is DayZ Standalone because they would have developed the engine and game internally which would have gone way faster than having to integrate portions of the new engine into a live game as they go along, constantly redoing things over and over again like animations and what not."

"That makes two of us. Kind of... He is generally unhappy right now. Not just with me, but with almost everything in his life. The way he looks, his job, our marriage, etc. It breaks my hearts to know he's so miserable. He wants to make a change, and better himself. Which of course I don't hold against him. Unfortunately, he seems to think our marriage is one of the things holding him back. I don't know why, he hasn't been overly specific.
He's never even come close to bringing up divorce before. Of the two of us, he is the solid foundation. I think I've been his world for a long time and he lost parts of himself he wants to get back. I want that for him too. I just wish he saw some way his happiness and our marriage could co-exist."

Galileo verified it and didn’t get in trouble for a round Earth, the church didn’t need to be convinced but they didn’t believe the Earth moved.

Aliens are a different subject but the evidence for a round global earth extend almost 3000 years and is easily verifiable with simple geometry."

"Because social programs help society in general, acting like prevention for all.

Not everyone is in the same circumstances. A set price for healthcare and no social support safety net means only some of the population can pay for it, and the poorest suffers and dies.

Whether it be healthcare or poverty, they're both an endless treadmill of doom, and people at the edge will continuously fall off. This slowly weakens the country.

So while not paying for taxes on any social services might save you money immediately, you'll definitely be paying for it in other ways.

There's a reason why other advanced nations all have strong social services and healthcare: it does help. A lot."

"&gt; So like math, they do have rules, but those rules are arbitrary and can be affected or changed.

Not if you want the math to work...  

&gt;How do you figure on predetermination?  

Take a word like *cat*. In Arabic it's *قَطُّ* (qaṭṭu). Both the English word and the Arabic word **independently** relate to words for ""cutting""; *قَطُّ* can mean both ""a cat"" and ""to carve; to cut, to trim, to clip, to pare; to sharpen a nib, pencil"". This is intrinsic to their (meta-)etymologies, because *cutting* is intrinsic to the nature of cats. It is no coincidence that the words for ""cat"" and ""cut"" sound the same in English, even though there is no direct etymological descent, and that the same applies in Arabic.  

&gt;Even if what I was studying was pseudo-theism— and I still don't accept that— then that doesn't make me an apatheist. If there is a god or gods, then I want to know. I do care. I just may be going about finding it in an inefficient way.  

Yeah, fair enough. But that's why I said you don't have the choice. You are being forced to be an apatheist. 
This sort of situation may be analogical to someone ""wanting to go swimming"" with there being no body of water to swim in and no realistic possibility of travelling to it (or even no solid idea that such a body necessarily exists; people who ""swim"" seem to only conceive of *swimming* as ""wallowing in mud""), in which case their actual desire to go swimming subsides to the point them becoming apathetic towards swimming -- or it doesn't even *properly develop* in the first place (despite the instinctual, innate potential).  

&gt;I'm not sure about Satan  

Snakes and dragons. Perhaps the most ancient archetypes in mythology.  

&gt;I don't understand why this is needed. Humanity essentially starting with one proto-language and branching out doesn't convey anything inherently metaphysical to me.  

*Meta-physical*, not *metaphysical*, although it conveys both.  
*Meta-physical* has more to do with how our vocal organs are structured, how nature physically necessitates certain sounds to be reflected through language in order to ""describe itself"" etc.  
There is indeed a harmful agenda that omits this and doesn't discuss this. It would hate for people to realize that the world is ""made out of language"", because that would make them question their programming. The fact people are ignorant in regards to this also allows pseudo-historiography to push the false agenda that ""genetics don't reveal cultural background"", even when it's so obvious to a critical thinker that genes would simply not survive without given modes of being that become expressed through cultural inheritance unique to the corresponding genetic patterns.

&gt;I don't get why this is metaphysical, again. The proto-language and subsequent interdependence or trade/warfare/conquering would spread ideas and languages.  

Again, *meta-physical*.  
Warfare and all these things have meta-physical natures. Like how spears and bows were invented independently.  
For that reason Arabic *قوس* (qaws) means ""arch"" as well as ""bow"" (used in hunting or wars), as is the case with Latin *arcus*. And then even the use of the sounds **q** (or **c** in Latin) and **s** is (more or less) predetermined (or optimally adequate -- at least in the respective culture).  

&gt;Don't... Slavic names have Latin and Greek roots? Cyrillic was based on Greek, and names like Александр are Greek. Альбина is the female version that originally was taken from a Roman Saint Albinus.  

Some names and words have Greek and Latin roots, but they are not original. *Alex* goes back to what is behind the PIE reconstruction *h₂lek-*, which actually has to do with *łęk* or *łuk* (""bow"" -- weapon), as well *ług* (""bog"" -- place strategic in defense and in hiding, a sanctuary); *ślęczeć* (""to drudge [at]"") and hundreds of other closely related words. The Slavic language group better describes these relations and provides more of them. Greek and Latin just focus on a small subset and/or are ""all over the place"", as if these languages were developed very fast through a sort of ""orphaning"" and ""adoption"" -- which they were. The She-wolf (Proto-Slavic ""adopter"") that raised Remus and Romulus (Proto-Italic ""orphans"") represents this mythologically in the case of Latin.

&gt;I'd give it a go.  

Doubtful you would if you knew my methodology. Plus it's even dangerous and illegal for me to suggest you do the things I'd have to suggest (and illegal for you to perform them).  "

"It was just almost 2 weeks ago. I’ve told a couple friends who have been supportive. But dealing with both traumas at the same time is hard. I feel like I can’t have sex for a really long time. I get anxiety just thinking about someone trying to get intimate or touch me in that way. I didn’t really realize what it was until a week after. And just yesterday I went to see a counselor on my campus and they helped to reassure me that I wasn’t crazy in what I thought. He used his power to seduce me. I’m the one who made it seem ok because that’s what was easier to go along with. I felt like I couldn’t say no, I just didn’t know how. The counselor said in situations like those, you fight or flight but also you have freeze. And in those types of situations, 80% freeze. I froze, and it’s crazy to me because I always thought of myself as that person to come out from stuff like that and not let it happen to me. I’ve involved myself in so many things against sexual assault, have helped others..started clubs, taken self defense. It’s just crazy because it could happen to me or anyone no matter what. Key part, no matter what.

  You don’t sound pushy at all, you’re actually really helping. The whole realization thing is hard to accept. It just makes me feel sick to my stomach now when I think of it or I hear a lyric in a song. I’m getting so many triggers and different responses which I’m not used to. And because that sexual experience resulted in my HSV...those two are always going to be tied to each other...and that’s what I’m currently working on.

"&gt; I don't trust republicans to devise tax reform because they hamstring attempts to prevent tax loops and fraud and then act upset when people don't trust them to do their jobs and enact good policies that combat tax loops and fraud.

That's absolutely fair, I agree with you. I don't trust them either. I will be absolutely surprised if trump goes through with his proposed tax cuts for the middle class.

&gt; I get that you dont dig immigrants or whatever but the main chunk of problems you've described have been distrust in officials doing their jobs and policies that aren't enforced correctly

Well no, we've just gone off on a tangent. My point was that illegals voting is a real issue. It is well known that democrats want illegals being able to vote and that they don't want voter fraud protections which would stop them from doing it illegally now. The republicans on the other hand are working to stop illegals from voting and the brainwashed masses are acting like democracy is a partisan issue. Like I said earlier, it isn't about democracy being partisan. The partisanship is that one side wants illegals to vote and the other side doesn't.

But to that point that you can't trust the government I absolutely agree. Both sides are full of liars and are trying to screw us over in different ways. The left isn't trying to get illegals to vote because they care about people or something silly like that. They just want power and to demolish the middle class by importing low level workers who will rely on welfare and work for less which in turn gives global corporations more money. The right wants to solidify its right to use power and build trust with the traditional american identity so they can justify wars and tax cuts for the rich in the name of american excellence. "

[This article goes into the idea in more detail and is def worth a read.](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/business/yourmoney/17every.html)

But, TL;DR:, Nazi's feared the world running out of food so they conquered a bunch of it for themselves.  Oh and they killed off a lot of the locals so fewer folks would have to be fed.  This tells me that the possibility of Hitler 2.0s very likely in a future where climate change is wrecking food chains and destabilizing societies.

But I imagine, by that point, environmental policy will be largely useless.  Solutions to climate change require global scale solutions and international cooperation.  Once the world reaches the point that things are falling apart, States likely won't have the power or the resources to cooperate and/or trust one another."

"Came here for this.  Japan wasn't thinking of a long, drawn-out war.  The pro-war faction thought that Yamamoto's promised six months of hell would be enough to get the Americans to sue for peace.  After all:

America was still recovering from a horrible economic depression.

Many Americans were still deeply isolationist.

America was inching closer to joining the war in Europe.  Why would they want to mess with Japan?

Most Americans probably couldn't find French Indochina on a map, let alone give a rat's ass as to who's controlling it.

Japan thought that most Americans were lazy and decadent, and just wouldn't be able to match the awesomeness that is the Japanese soldier.

Yamamoto, OTOH, had been to America.  Yamamoto argued against these assumptions.  Yamamoto was right."

"Yeah dude, it would be great if all the post-launch content they're talking about would be included at launch. It would have been great if all the DLC for BF1 was instead ready to go at the game's launch. But that's just not how it works. You're being unrealistic.

All this stuff looks like positive additions to the game, and it's all coming for free a couple weeks/months down the like. Why are you upset? To call the game unfinished just sounds like whining. It's what people say about every single game that has post-launch DLC close to the release. I'm happy to just be able to play the game in a couple weeks, instead of waiting until next year for it. Is that what you would prefer?

The game isn't unfinished, they're just prioritizing what to work on before/after launch. Target Range and Rush are less important than core Battlefield features. They can't do it all at once. It's all free. Who cares. I'm gonna hop on and play 30 hours of Conquest on launch. Sounds like a full game to me."

"This sounds really bad... I've only ever had to do it once with one particular bad player who was the husband of one of my good friends so kicking him basically meant kicking off my friend too so I really didn't want to do that but...

After like the 4th 10 minute argument of the session I was at the end of my rope and I kind of snapped and just completly gave in to whatever he was complaining about during that particular combat. However, after combat was over I just very calmly asked him to make a CON, save DC 30, basically only a Nat 20 could save him, he failed.   I told him his character suddenly drops to the floor convulsing taking half his HP worth of damage. Party starts freaking out cleric makes a medicine check does well, I explain to the party that they don't really have a name for it in this time period but he is experiencing a brain aneurysm, they can strike anywhere at anytime. Have problem player roll another con save, he's freaking out at me but I'm too far in to turn back now, he fails again he's at 0 now, cleric is solid bro who picks up on what I'm trying to do, says this must be God's will, won't heal him. Problem Guy is literally 4Chan reeeing at me, I calmly look at him and say I am the high god of this world, I can do this whenever I want and there isn't a thing you can do about it other than walk away.  So if you want to keep fighting me on everything this will happen at less opportune times than I picked now. He storms off I think I fucked things up real bad but at least I stood up for myself. Fortunately his husband was able to calm him down and he came back apologized for what he had been doing and the problem became much less an issue, he didn't stop completely but if things were starting to escalate cleric bro would just ask how how head was feeling and that usually calmed things down. 

I offer this story just to add another idea, this isn't the optimal way to solve the problem or the most adult but it worked for me. I had talked to this guy a few times about the issue before this happened and this was my hail Mary play. Thank you Archer for letting me use your 3rd biggest fear and Tyr bless cleric bro for always having my back. "

"Wtf are you even talking about?

Stop picking fights. Many posters are confused by your negativity  

T-70 isn’t out yet. It will come with the Resistance Conversion kit. They will be available at the same time. 

The reason people are confused by your post is because you indicated that this article, a preview article about unreleased 2.0 content, should be reflective of how FFG will support already released conversion kit content via stand-alone ship releases. 


I think this article doesn’t really support you what you are saying because the T-70 blister will come out at the same time as the Resistence conversion kit. Much lie how the T-65 and Rebel kits came out at launch together. 

All good now?

"Few thoughts.

Cash is king.  Loans can be deferred/paid later, but you won't get the money back if you pay them down early.

Don't buy real estate.  I had lots of friends stuck with extra places they couldn't sell when the market fell (especially when they got married and needed a new place).  This is doubly true if you live in Denver or any other market that looks frothy.

Even at the worst, most places didn't stop hiring, they just slashed the numbers.  Most people just moved down a peg or two in the normal pecking order.  Cast a wide net.

Don't do something stupid like fail the bar or hit on a partner's wife.  Your margin for error is that much less in a recession.

Pay extra attention to the tips others normally give you.  Network, don't burn bridges, etc., etc.

Be flexible.  Clerking on the Alaska Supreme Court in January might not be your idea of paradise, but it can be a lot better for your career than working doc review in NYC."

"My wife and I waited to find out gender with all three of our kids, and will do the same on any future kids, God willing. 

Your story is one of the reasons why: knowing gender is just another thing to worry about leading up to birth. You know the gender and you start imposing a personality and having all these assumptions. 

When baby was born, I cried because we had a baby. It was a girl, and she was a perfect, and I saw her and loved her for who she was and found out the gender all in the same moment. 

With baby number 2, I cried because it was a boy. We both wanted a boy.

With baby number 3, I just cried because it was all over, he was there...another perfect life. Neither of us cared what the gender was for #3. "

"Jon Snow. 

He grows up among “Northern royalty” but doesn’t experience it like his siblings/cousins.

He signs a lifetime contract with the Watch, and then has to come to terms with what that means. 

He gets to explore the uncharted northern frontier. He doesn’t really get overwhelmed by what he sees and generally acts pretty rationally while he’s with Halfhand and then the Wildlings.

He kills a wight.

He is down to earth. He is able to see the good, human qualities in the Wildlings, and he buys into “what you did before doesn’t matter after you say your vows.” Compare that to Cotter Pyke or the Mallister guy who nearly becomes Lord Commander - both of those guys despise one another based on each other’s upbringing. 

He does what he thinks is right instead of what’s easy or what’s expected. Sometimes that backfires but it’s fun to read.

His affair with Ygritte is really enjoyable and emotional reading.

His POV chapters convey a strong sense that Jon is some sort of “chosen one” but he does a pretty good job of not getting caught up in that."

"To set the initial edge I would be looking for a courser stone than 400, something like 120-220. Depending what the use of the knives is, you may want to finish at 600 or 1000. While mirror polished, super high grit edges look great and seem impressive cutting paper and stuff, in things like hunting knives, they aren’t really worth a shit. I have done quite a bit of testing with hunters and demo knives, and I find that by far the majority of them prefer a stropped edge at lower grits around 400. This gives the edge some bite to keep cutting. List of them even liked a 220 grit edge for hunting. High polished edges cut great until they lose that super fine razor edge and then don’t cut meat and hide worth a damn. I once read that Phill Hartsfield would often only take his combat knives to between 80 and 120 grit. They didn’t look very impressive slicing paper, but when it came to cutting meat and flesh, it was a completely different story. "

"I don't remember the exact numbers last year, but something like 10% of the original applicants actually made it through. The good news though is that most of those rejected are in the resume or technical rounds, so if you make it through those you're not guaranteed anything but very likely to land an internship. The organizers of the Xtern program try to ensure that everyone who makes it to interviews gets a position, so unless you're reeeaally bad at interviews as long as you get to the interviews you're doing really well. And for what it's worth, I'm terrible at interviews (and did awfully last year) and still ended up well out of it. You might not necessarily get your first choice in company to work with though.

"Well, everyone is making guesses about the new hero being teased so I might as well take a shot.

Mccree is the character being focused on in the ads for blizzcon and his home map is the one with a payload change.  So it seems pretty obvious the new character will have some relation to him. First guess is a member of the deadlock gang.

The deadlock gang is all about weapons and the route 66 map is all about escorting a weapon into their hideout and the new payload looks like the core of a MEKA unit without any mobility or weapons. It doesn't match the color scheme of any known Pilots.  It seems unlikely we are getting a pilot and anyone who knows Mccree from His deadlock days is most likely a fully grown American adult and would most likely be larger than a Korean Teenager and unable to fit inside.

Torbjorn's Rework ultimate didn't really need to change from a game balance perspective unless the goal is to stop his PoTGs from spawn.  Now there isn't a smart ult to make up for a team fight when you are down a member.  Having a two of these ults would obviously be a bit busted so removing Torb's makes room for a ult similar to his old one to be put into the game.

Actual theory time: We are getting a deadlock member With a Smart Mech based ult.  The ult would most likely deploy like d.va calling her new mech. It could be a smart turret that functions like Torb's old ult.  The character itself might be cowboy themed after Mccree.  Maybe female add some variety to the cowboy armor.  It could also be a less intelligent robot ""pet"" companion as an assistant to the human character. As for a weapon my money is on a Coach gun, maybe with a slug in one chamber and buck shit in the other."

"&gt; You really really need to get specific about what ""correction"" means. 

I did: 

&gt; When the market suddenly undoes the very allocation of supply to fulfill demand that it had previously built up such that the economy subsequently shrinks, the previous build up can be thought of as a market failure. Hence the process by which prices plummet (along with all the subsequent effects) until the market can reorient to start growing the economy again, can be accurately called ""correction"".

.

&gt; Why was the subprime mortgage crisis a ""correction"" but, for example, the fact that the price of an iPhone 2 is now $0 isn't?

Because the former resulted in a recession, while the latter did not. 

&gt; I understand perfectly well that ""defaulting"" is an ""objective"" phenomena (in some sense). I also understand that people indeed started defaulting on their mortgages. However, contrary to what you said, **this fits perfectly with ""banks started realizing their investments (mortgage loans) were unprofitable (because people were defaulting, and there weren't other suitable buyers).""** 

It doesn't really fit, because the way you word it takes focus away from the actual inciting event that led to the bursting of the mortgage bubble. And it's not that banks ""started realizing"" their investments were unprofitable. Their investments *became* catastrophically unprofitable once the mortgage defaults started. 

&gt; STV says ""value"" is the subjective ""feeling"" one gets from an economic good. (the existence of this ""feeling"" and our knowledge of this statement are both justified introspectively). 

You're missing some important facts. ""Value"", regardless of whether you ascribe to Marx's Law of Value or STV has always meant ""what something is worth"" in economics. Subjectivists argue that there is no objective basis for value for a commodity at all (essentially, that what a commodity is ""worth"" is simply whatever people *feel* it is worth), while those in my camp argue that there is. What my argument from OP shows is that there must be an objective basis for value for a commodity, because if there was not then we'd have no rational way to make sense of *why* recessions, in general, occur. 

&gt; What I don't understand in your argument is how any of this refutes the STV. As I said, ""price deviating from value"" is nonsensical/meaningless within STV. 

Which is why the STV is itself nonsensical. Going off of what I said above, if we accept that the previous build up of was a market failure then it necessarily follows that the undoing of that allocation was a market correction. The concepts of market ""failure"" and ""correction"" necessarily indicate that price deviated from value. How else would you make sense of it? If value is subjective then there can be no such thing as a market ""failure"" or ""correction"". So you'd have to explain why the reasoning above (where I explain why I call it a ""correction"") is incorrect. If, on the other hand, you end up conceding the point that it's accurate to call it a ""correction"" it must necessarily follow that price deviated from value. And from there it must necessarily follow (as I indicated in my reasoning steps from OP) that there is such a thing as an objective value for a commodity. 

&gt; Lack of an explanation for why it specifically happened in 2007 is not a refutation of STV. (Also, just saying ""people ran out of money"" is also not an explanation for why 2007. Why did they run out in 2007? Why not 2005?) 

My apologies for the long wait. I've been trying to find an article from businessinsider from 2005 or 06 that pertains to my explanation to provide evidence in support of what I'll argue for this point. I'll keep trying to find that article and will write another comment reply with my answer to this point you've brought up if I am able to find it.

"From the opinion of a person who does residential wiring for a living there are quite a few code violations for this fixture. Wire splices need to be accessible for maintenance. Wire nutting a current carrying conductor in a metal pipe runs the risk of the nut coming loose and energizing your gas pipe. Also, over time with a load the metal will expand and contract from heat depending on the amount of current the bulbs you use with could loosen your wire nuts. If you cannot use a single strand of THHN stranded wire to your bulb holder. I reccomend using crimp connectors and then heat shrink wrapping them. They will take up less space and also be insulated. People are mentioning grounding, metal parts need to be grounded to follow code. So I would suggest running a ground nut into your ballast and ground the wire in the junction box you are mounting the fixture in. Looks great but make it safe!

"I’m seeing a lot of AMNH recs. But the AMNH is kind of weird and I didn’t get it the first time I went.  
  
The thing about the AMNH that I think gets frequently overlooked is that it’s a “museum of a museum”. It’s old as fuck, and unlike the Met it hardly changed it to fit the times. There’s some legit animal exhibits, but this huge and oft-ignored part of it is walking through these surreal and dull “natural history” dioramas containing mannequins of topless “natives” from every continent on earth except, of course, Europe. For a long time a Congolese man named [Ota Benga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ota_Benga) was literally confined in one of these glass cages as a human zoo exhibition. These exhibits have changed very little since then.   
  
So now it’s sort of meant to be a depiction of what the museum used to be back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Taken for that, it can be appreciated.  But I think a lot of the tourists who come by the AMNH are unaware of this and just take the anthropological exhibitions at face value.  
   
Unfortunately the signage and marketing of the museum doesn’t really do anything to indicate this, and there’s a lot of politics in the curation process that aggressively prevents anything from getting changed or labeled. "

What a euphemism. This is exactly why I said I shouldn’t engage in a serious conversation with you.

Why is this disqualifying for a football player, and not for a president?

Obviously because Trump is a diplomat trying to manipulate other countries using feigned kindness. Which is standard for diplomats, in fact, its so standard that we made a word after the idea: “(speaking) diplomatically”. The idea that this is unique to Trump is as dumb as it gets."

My first Xmas on my own she gave me a whole apartment's worth of decorations that she didn;t want because she was on to a new colour scheme. When I moved out of the country I gave them back, so she probably got rid of them.  

Personally, I just add to the decorations every year. On our first Christmas together my husband and I bought enough for a basic tree, and now we just keep adding to that collection. I think this year it will have to be more lights, last year we were kind of short.  "

"Can't really tell how much they're charging for the crown from what you're charged for OOP. Does your insurance cover 20%, 50%, 80%? Crowns are typically in the range of 800-1500, and with LA and California in general being a more expensive state, I can only imagine that dentistry costs are on the higher end. Now as for the color match - that's something you should have discussed with the dentist the day that crown was placed, otherwise, it's useless as your other teeth will change color from drinking coffee/wine etc.

Remove the beef and chill it completely. Strain the juice and reduce it adding wine or seasonings as you like. If it's weak then add a good beef base (I recommend Better than Bouillon).  Degrease (or put in the fridge until the fat hardens). 

If you're going to sous vide it then you can brush some beef base on the surface and add sliced veg (don't use the garlic however - it could be a danger for long cooks) to the bag with the beef. Seal and process for 24 hours at 130 F. 

Now slick the beef very thinly. It's hard to do it at home unless you have a deli slicer. You can then warm up the slices in the beef juices and there you go. Put onto a nice crusty roll and serve with the juice on the side. "

"&gt; In my view, the government has to continually justify its authority over me, and I don't have to justify my freedom from it. But the current arrangement is essentially the opposite, with the government claiming a right to control me irrespective of how I disclaim my consent.

I agree, and ideally, that's how the system works via a system of citizen feedback and amendments put forth by (somewhat) democratically elected representatives. What you seem to want is an instantaneous change in authority granted by 250 years worth of humans (for the US anyway) without going through the agreed upon process. Granted, that would be amazing, but as soon as you are born into a larger body of humans and agree to abide by the collectively bargained rights, you cannot short-circuit that process while also expecting to continue to participate.

We are born into a relatively strictly defined system. Those that defined it and those that have been amending it over centuries have continually asked the government to justify its authority over them with a very slow progression toward realizing those demands in a cycle. Can this cycle be shortened? Yes, of course, but it becomes increasingly difficult to do so as the population density increases. IMO, we aren't going to 'fix' the delays and obstacles to holding the government accountable by refusing to be governed, but by realizing that ""government"" is actually collective societal agreement that must be permeated in a necessarily time-consuming way before the entire animal changes direction. Which leads me to your next point...

&gt; You have a slightly stronger claim to consent when it comes to the local governing bodies.

Yes, absolutely - and you must think about why this is. If you and a friend decide you want sandwiches for lunch together, it probably won't take long for you both to agree on a place to go. Change ""you and a friend"" to ""a 15-passenger van full of family members from the same basic upbringing"", and it becomes unruly at best. Now make it ""two coach buses full of 90 individuals with no common thread other than their current proximity, animal species, basic need to eat food and seek shelter from the elements"", and it would take hours to gather suggestions and take a vote.

The population of the planet is increasing. Population density is increasing. The most governable body possible is indeed the individual, but individual existence is both horrendously inefficient and becoming increasingly impossible physically on human timescales.

So what are we to do?

That's 15 mins a day, 5 days a week, 51 weeks a year. At that point the company has stolen 63.75 hours of labor from each employee. If it's a small restaurant with only about 20 employees you're talking 1275 free labor hours in a year. With that and paying wait staff $2.01/hour for side work, the class action suit was a hell of a lot of money. Those who opted in received several thousand dollars each. Wage theft IS a big deal and you shouldn't fall for it. "

Where do you get this number? 

As of October 2017, Gallup polling found that 31% of Americans identified as Democrat, 24% identified as Republican, and 42% as Independent. Assuming that every single one of the 325.7 million Americans was a registered, voting age, adult you'd still only reach about 80mil Republicans. 

According to 2018 [data from Larry Sabato at the University of Virginia](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/var/plain/storage/images/media/commentary_images/cook/cook_table_1_july_12_2018/1278418-1-eng-US/cook_table_1_july_12_2018.png) there are only 32 million registered Republicans, compared to the 42 million registered Democrats.

Austin received five individual grants to settle families within the state, for a total of 5,600 families. And he was far from the only empresario. All told the country authorized settlement of some 10-15000 Anglo families. Juan Almonte’s survey of 7,700 anglos *individuals* almost certainly undercounted the American population. But it likely mostly missed legal immigrants as it undercounted Austin’s Brazos colony by 2000 or so. There was no need for illegal immigration, as the legal immigration wasn’t attracting nearly as many families as hoped. 

The slaves also weren’t illegal. Mexico outlawed trade from Africa. But they explicitly allowed American settlers to bring slaves with them into Mexico. They had a gradual emancipation law on the books which in theory would have started freeing Texas slaves in 1840. When the 1829 law freeing all slaves in Mexico was passed, Texas not only got an exemption, but as the previous law was superseded, the planned 1840 emancipation also disappeared. While slavery was a point of contention between the Anglo settlers and Mexico City, it wasn’t illegal within Texas in 1835, although the threat that it might *become* illegal loomed large.

The Texas revolution also wasn’t a crackdown by Mexican authorities. It was sparked by the central government’s abrogation of the Mexican Constitution of 1824. And it was hardly the only area to break into revolt. The Yucatán, Tabasco, and the Republic of the Rio Grande (Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and Coahuila) also rebelled against the new government. "

"I really want Vettel to take 2019. The anount of negativity he gets for his mistakes is really harsh, in F1, you are your harshest critic, he knows they were his mistakes that cost him this year. To be fair though, I love Vettel’s explosive styke of driving, but he needs to calm down slightly

The rule here is consistency, and Vettel does not have it

Races in which he didnt win

China- 8th (really not his fault this one)

Azerbaijan- 4th (banzai move for win, had he stuck behind Bottas :( he would have won anyway)

Spain- Horrible strategy, P4

Monaco- Probably the only time he kept his head, and I commend him for it. P2, didnt overdrive, brought home a solid result

France- P4 or P5, cant really remember, hits Bottas into T1 in a rash move, and off podium again

Austria- P3, but his penalty hurt his result, and the Merc failures (who started on the front row that day) it should have been a much better result, P3, wouldve been P5 without Merc issues

Germany- Oh it hurts, it really does. Crashes off from the lead, the insistence to win here cost him. Also Ferrari out him in a bad situation against Hamilton with hiw they handled Kimi, shouldn’t have been under pressure to begin with, DNF

Hungary- P2, but very lucky to escape serious contact with Bottas, could have been much worse. He had to fight for this one

Italy- We know the story here, both he and Ferrari fucked up. Lead driver should have been given best chance for pole, and Vettel started P2. Kimi blocked him into T1, it was Vettel’s mistake as he was late on the brakes, contact with Hamilton, and his second 360 of the year. P4 I believe was the result, he really should have won this race

Singapore- Off pace compared to the Mercs, forgettable race, P3

Sochi- Team orders spoiled an already boring race, Vettel kept it clean though, really aggresive block that would have taken both Hamilton and him out that day, P3 I think was his finish

Japan- Jesus Christ. Unecessary spin off Max Verstappen, revenge for China gone wrong, Max had a penalty anyway, no reason to risk that much, not even mentioning Ferrari’s fuck up of the ages in qualifying, P5, and even that was just due to Ricciardo’s failure

USA- Penalty in qualifying for speeding under red flags (unnecessary from Seb) and then tried to be too aggresive on Ricciardo, into quadruple digits in degrees spun throughout the season, and finishes P4, taking advantage of Ric’s retirement (see a pattern) and Bottas’s massive mistake down into T12


Here lies the problem- If Vettel doesnt win, he has finished second only once (Hungary) and on the last step of ghe podium only four times this season (Monaco, Austria, Singapore, Russia)

For contrast, Hamilton has finished off the podium only three times this season (China, Canada, and Austria)

Vettel 10 podiums this season, Hamilton 15. There’s those 75 points we keep talking about. If you dont win, secure points

"I don't know how to make this more clear:

You feeling shame doesn't mean your partner is shaming you.

You feeling dirty doesn't mean that your partner is shaming you.

Even your partner *thinking you are dirty* doesn't mean that *you have to feel dirty*.

The answer to every one of your, ""How would you feel if..."" questions is that I would feel disappointed in my partner, recognize that those are *her feelings*, but I would not feel dirty or shameful because *my feelings don't have to be the same as my partner's feelings*. I would assess whether, in light of my partner's feelings, the relationship is still meeting my needs and, if not, leave.

The feelings you are describing, where your partner feeling you are **X** means that you must either convince your partner to change their feelings, or you must feel/be **X**, is known as enmeshment, a state in which personal boundaries are permeable and unclear.

&gt;Yes she made a choice about her body that is fine and encouraged but you CANNOT expect someone else to feel okay with that and not see it as sex shaming

Yes, you absolutely can, because you and your partner are different people.

&gt;telling them they will never be able to do anything else with you because of what you’ve done is slut shaming

Nope, that's her making a choice about her body. Slut shaming would be if she told you that you were worth less as a person because of what you had done. Did she tell you that? Or did she just not feel comfortable having sex with you?

&gt;You haven’t been through what I have

Maybe not, but I've been in couples counseling with someone with BPD for over 2 years, so I've got a much better idea of how your partner's feelings trigger feelings of shame in you than you realize, and it has been absolutely driven home, for both me and my partner, that the remedy to this is better interpersonal boundaries."

"Many properties are required to be exempt from rent control per the Costa Hawkins legislation—anything built after 1992, single family homes and condos, and newly-listed real estate (which is way many tenants are evicted so that landlords can raise rents). So no matter what rent control is enacted, without passing 10, many properties won't get those benefits and the city will have no recourse to appeal to the state.

rent control is not THE solution but it is A solution, when combined with proper building. we already over-index on luxury housing construction because it's the most profitable for developers—what makes you think voting no on 10 will change that?"

"I think the problem is that there are too many things that we should be paying attention to. Comparing it to chess, there you can only move one piece at a time and that is hard enough for a lot of people.   


In AoE, in just an army battle you could potentially be trying to manoeuvre 50 units at once, say mangonels, archers, monks. That is already pushing the limits of what a human can do.   


Adding tasks that are off-screen, say gold piles drying up means that to be optimal, you have to constantly flick between screens. This is unpleasant to the eyes, yet to win money in a tournament this may be required.  


When automation of these tasks are possible, is it really fair to ask the player to take full control of up to 200 separate units at once? Is it not fair to at least let them work on one part of the battle?  


Sure the best players use their skill to win games with rapid task-switching, but they are human. They are placing enormous strain on their body and mind to achieve these feats.  


I have played a lot of AoE2, and other games like MOBAs, and I think realistically, once you have an army to control, villagers should be easier to control from afar. They should have some sort of brain. They should be able to do basic tasks, and respond to input, say if you tell them to support an archer rush or basic siege knight comp etc. It would make the game more enjoyable, beautiful, and still have inifinite room for humans to perfect it."

I think this is a case where having a hands-on demonstration with a real, live person (of each sex) should probably be part of the training, so no problem whatsoever with the idea behind it.

But singling out a particular male or female and telling them they have to do it is wrong. Bringing in an outside model is the obvious solution.

In this case, if she isn’t comfortable with that she needs to say so. I’d suggest telling the instructor she isn’t comfortable with it and if the instructor gives any pushback whatsoever — any reaction other than ‘I understand, we’ll find someone who can serve as the model, I apologize for my insensitivity’ — then the department head or Title IX office is the way to go."

"Okay ill bite I cant take it anymore. I've been debating on starting KC ever since a buddy who tries to stick with keto but only ends up doing a few weeks at a clip let me try a sample of his. I think he would cave in and crave actual food.

I cant remember the flavor but it was pretty damn good. I don't know if I can get used to not eating solid food but I cant cook worth a damn so maybe this will work out. I was using the price of a 21 meal supply ($65-70) as a excuse but shoot I spend at least $10-15 a day in eating out at lunch at work and its not salads either.

"I've got an 18 401A PP1 w/ active exhaust.

The 6 speed is a blast, albeit notchy when cold. I'm going to swap fluid to amsoil or royal purple soon, and eventually get a steeda shifter. The 10 speed was nice but coming from an old school auto with a strong shift kit no modern auto in the price range is any good comparatively (shifting wise). Also, driving manual in traffic is so overblown on the internet it is ridiculous. Unless you live in India it is not bad. Just leave room and crawl forward @7-10km in first. No big deal.

Digi dash is awesome, no other word for it. I initially didn't care about it until I drove a car with it and had to have it.

Active Exhaust is the same as above. Once I'm out of warranty I'm definitely going headers to h pipe into active mufflers. That's how good it sounds (especially in track mode)

No opinion on magneride.

PP1 is a must if you want to have any one of the options that come with it. The brake kit alone is close to the price. PS4Ss are like 2k in Canada. Bigger rad, tower brace, etc. One big thing to keep in mind is that the ABS is set up for a staggered wheel height so if you want to run a big tire out back you can have a good amount of sidewall and not worry about the ABS.if you want the classic muscle car rake then all you need are 2 wheels out back. Manuals get 3.73s as well.

Aftermarket is awesome, but again to get the things you mentioned it's fairly cheaper to get what Ford has packaged (to some extent)."

"Interesting question. One thing first: It may happen that I - AA^T is invertible but I - B is not, so whatever relation there is shouldn't be too close. And the invertibility of B does indeed follow from those of AA^T and A^T A, simply because the latter invertibilities yield that A and A^T are both square and invertible (and this yields the invertibility of B)."

I will agree that the market has hit posters hard, however there is a tonne of work going on behind the scenes, most of which I can only share when I am given the say so from those higher up than me. 
I am trying to drip down any news as it comes ready for release.

&gt;for me personally it’s starting to get to the point where I don’t read or take these updates as seriously, because there isn’t really amazing updates every day.

Such is Life, I'm afraid. We can't expect amazing updates every day, We can't expect a great day at work everyday, We can't expect a personal and romantic relationship without rocky patches etc. etc.
What we can expect is I will try to accentuate the positive..... even on a down day.

Hope you find some more good stuff to read in my future updates.

Also don't make a big deal about getting the number. Number's don't mean shit for the most part, it's only a means for further communication (setting up the next meetup, flirting, etc). You have to spend **time** with a girl IRL not over the phone or text.

"Ah, so like more self-conscious then? 

If she’s a leaner person, she might enjoy the way your body is different from hers, and she’s expressing that by grabbing at you a bit. You tend to touch the parts of your partner that you like, that are interesting to you, right? Not just sexually, but on a tactile level.

I’d just talk to her a bit more next time it comes up, but go into the convo with a more positive outlook. I think she’s doing it because she enjoys it. And she’s with you because she likes you. So find out why she likes doing it (and not just that it’s not sexual, or whatever else it’s not). You may feel happier overall to get this out in the open and find out something positive, whereas right now you’re just a little confused and uncomfortable."

"Nah you're missing my point. You just listed the legitimate criticisms, of which I already acknowledged there are plenty. I'm far from a Hue supporter if that's what you're insinuating. I just don't go the other way and blame him for things that legitimately weren't really his fault. We were setup to lose the last two years. Maybe not 1-31 bad, but pretty fucking close to it. Kizer himself directly cost us about 4 wins with late game horrible turnovers. Saying Hue is bad because his overall win loss record is bad is a low-effort argument. That was my only point.


Also the Tyrod point isn't a good one. The directive to start Tyrod and let Baker sit was agreed upon by the FO and coaching staff. That's not on Hue."

" 

V-sync  is short for “vertical sync,” which means that your video card will be  keeping pace with your monitor’s refresh rate. The most common monitor  refresh rate is 60hz, which means the monitor can deliver 60 frames per  second.

With V-sync turned off, you can have  a failure case called “screen tearing,” where the top of the screen is  updated before or after the bottom of the screen. Sometimes this isn’t a  huge deal, but often it causes a discordant image where the top and  bottom of your screen are rendering noticeably different perspectives.  V-sync fixes this problem.

On the other  hand, turning V-sync on takes away some flexibility from the video card.  If your video card consistently needs more than 1/60 of a second to  render a frame, then it will consistently miss the monitor’s deadline.  Instead of (for example) 50 frames per second with a little screen  tearing, you wind up rendering a new image on every other refresh, which  gives you only 30 frames per second. Likewise, switching V-sync on will  turn 28 frames per second into 20, since the video card will miss two  out of three monitor refreshes.

Most of the  time, a game looks better with V-sync turned on. If you’re having frame  rate trouble, it’s worth seeing what happens when you turn V-sync off.  If your video card could handle 55 frames per second, you probably won’t  notice much tearing and you’ll get a better frame rate. Usually,  though, a screen tearing problem looks way worse than a poor frame rate,  which is why V-sync is typically turned on by default."

"It's pretty bizarre tho, because they *are* using it for 5W charging AFAIK, so is everyone else... Qi triumphed over the competing standard pretty early on, that should've been the end of the story, the people behind it kept developing Qi... Yet it seems Google, possibly Samsung, and others decided to do their own thing or introduce special checks when doing 10W+ (and Apple had to be Apple and do 7.5W...).

It's not entirely clear to me how they're enforcing this at the hardware level, I'd like to know more about that, about at what levels the phones actually charge depending on battery level (I assure you it's not 10W the whole way even on their official Stand), etc etc. Fawning over inaccurate Ampere screenshots doesn't really answer any of those questions tho.

The Nexus 5 actually charged faster at times over wireless than over a wire, because it had a 5W cap either way and finding decent 5V/1A chargers that weren't made exclusively for Apple back then was a crapshoot. That's when the BC standard for USB charging started adapting... Then people like Qualcomm did some propietary things along the way then we got USB PD.

Heck the Pixel 2 charged slower than the original and was hard capped at 10W, if that's still the case then the drop to 5W might not be as big a deal and/or might only matter when your battery is really low. I intend to do some testing but I'm no expert..."
It's pretty awful. Ugh
"It would have been even cooler for the story, instead of the Vex simply becoming better, Vance had been working with the Vex because Osiris had abandoned him, and in order to get closer and replicate Osiris's power Vance started working with them.

"I am a Latvian native speaker. There are three contrastive ""intonations"" (similar to pitch-accents, but with a few nuances) in Latvian, level, falling and broken. The broken intonationn indeed two vowels with a glottal stop in between (or laryngealization, in some interpretations), and is very similar to the Danish stød. For the falling intonation, I can't say much because I speak a dialect that does not distinguish the falling intonation from the broken one, but it is certainly two morae (a ""normal"" long vowel or diphthong). The level intonation is ""overlong"" and sometimes counted as three morae. The most helpful paper that would clear all of this up is an unpublished PhD thesis :/"

"If he is badmouthing you to his new 'partners' - and let's be real, he's there's a good chance he is just their flavor of the month - that reflects poorly on him. In the back of this hot couple's mind, his trash talk makes him sound petty and disloyal. Are they going to trust someone who badmouths old partners? If he his talking shit, you don't do anything except let him drown in it.

&gt;What does it say about me that when we broke up, he told me he wasn’t sure if he ever wanted to date again, yet four months later he’s dating multiple people? Was he lying? 

Yeah. Maybe he believed it at the time, but he lied. Nothing you can do about it but ask, 'what gives'.

&gt;I just have pretty consistently felt kinda inferior to him throughout our relationship. He’s always had the better job, dozens upon dozens of more friends, cooler lifestyle, all of that. I’ve tried emulating that when we were together but it was exhausting. I don’t know how to be as extroverted as he is. So I’ve felt pretty empty on the inside for a while now and I’m not sure why.


Break ups suck. 

Work out. Work on your mental health. Don't compare your life to his. The emptiness you feel is parts loneliness and depression, but those are things you can overcome.

Feeling inferior to an ex, especially one that seems to move on 'too quickly' isn't unusual. Perhaps they make more than you, drive a better car, or bought a house. Perhaps they're just slutting it up and getting a reputation around the community or immediately shacking up with a new boyfriend (who awkwardly looks like you). It doesn't matter. Looking at my ex's successful lives (and new relationships), I know I'd rather be me. And that realization helps me move on whenever the nostalgia bubbles up. "

I also teach first grade in a rough area and a lot of my kids have difficult home lives. I've started hugging them and kissing their foreheads (not all the kids, just the ones I'm close to). You can tell they need it. You can tell when you get a hug and all their stress just melts away and they feel truly safe.

It's such a simple thing that makes both parties feel so much better...but also until that boyfriend, I had never realized it."

They're filming at night as referenced by the background and this dude is lit up like a goddamn photo shoot.

"Hmm, are you sure you're up to the task? It's quite a bit to translate and there are lots of errors. Additionally, you have lots of random English words scattered about the Irish translation. Is this intentional or were you just not able to translate those words?

When translating a textlike this, it is advisable not to attempt to literally translate each sentence word for word. Most  important is to retain the meaning, and that is often done by expressing the same ideas using *Irish* phrases and typical Irish vocabulary, which might not always/necessarily be a literal translation. It's worth noting that on the outset.

I'm mad and tired of debating with retards who think things are fake because it makes guns or the right wing look bad.

If you don't like it, **get out of the thread**.

"Not a trailer- but the Archaon cutscene where the blind guy betrays you. I was always interested in that guy during the warhammer I campaigns.

In every campaign playthrough I was always waiting for that pivotal moment when chaos invaded and the world changed. 

So it was interesting to see what his narrative would be during a chaos campaign. After watching that bird turn into a Tzentchian daemon... well.... now I always look at the narrator sideways when he talks to me."

"&gt; Once people hit level cap, got the gear they want, have consumed the content that Bethesda produced, there's little reason to stay active a game.

That's true of like...all games that arent match-based like Halo or CS:GO. Plenty of people put 1,000s of hours into games like Halo 3,4, or 5 that have less than a hundredth of the content of a Bethesda game, and that happens because of how repayable match-based gaming can be. 

 In Bethesda games, once you've explored and cleared every location, beat the main quest, done all of the side quests, the game is over. Radiant quests, while often generic, can actually add some recurring replayability to the game if done right (not saying Skyrim or Fallout 4 did them right, 'go here and clear out X location' gets old fast). But even then, that still is something to do after all the other content is consumed. Fallout 76's Events and (hopefully) frequent updates should add more replayability than any Bethesda game ever had. 

Hell, people have spent so many hours in games like Minecraft and Ark, yet those games severely lack the content offered in a BGS title. A BGS title has handmade locations with stories, yet crafting and survival loops can also be rewarding experiences for players. A game that combines the two (Fallout 76) could be something special.

Few questions here why did you say the child of Brandon Stark and Ashara Dayne? I'm currently on A Feast For Crows and up to this point the story is that it was Ned who danced with Ashara Dayne and was interested in her.  All Brandon did was go up to Ashara and see if she would be willing to dance with his brother Ned.  So I'm wondering why you would think Brandon and Ashara would have a child.  Also how would Ser Arthur Dayne have a bastard child with Rhaella? She was the mad king's wife so I'm curious as to how you came about this scenario.

"Sure people can do what they wish, doesn't mean society has to deal with it though, so no it isn't a benefit to help smokers.

&gt;Third hand smoke eliminated

Already restricted to mostly smokers doing it to themselves by keeping them away from normal people.

&gt;Less pollution (the smoke &amp; the manufacturing process) and waste (butts)

The mining of the the parts required would need to be compared to the manufacturing of cigarettes for this to be proven.

&gt;Less strain on the healthcare system (from smoking related conditions)

Perhaps, but smokers were already forced to pay for that strain, maybe in Canada thats a benefit since it is a universal system.

&gt;Smoking does have a benefit of some sort. People like the way it feels. Cigars are a great example of that - they're not even addictive, people just enjoy the way it feels.

Yeah, that isn't a benefit.

&gt;In the same way, the only benefit of fast food over healthy food is that it feels good to some people.

Not even slightly true, fast food is, you guessed it, fast but it is also cheap and readily available that is why it is so popular. It provides nutrition during points where otherwise the person would get either even worse meals or none at all.

"Honestly.. most companies won’t even accept a failed drug test even with the recommendation because of liability or whatever there reason may be. It’s Arizona, employment is at will so they could pretty much tell you that’s it’s a no go for whatever reason..

That being said... I just moved from CA to here within the last couple months. My gf got a job at a call center where they don’t even drug test. So there are jobs like that out here. Personally, I have smoked the last few years consistently, and have been able to pass all drug tests given to me. It’s gonna depend on a few factors, the biggest being if it’s a mouth or urine test. 

For mouth swab, just make sure to brush your mouth out extremely extremely thoroughly. Like brush them everywhere, your gums, tongue the usual and more. Use listerene, chew gum. Drink water before your test too and you should be good. I passed a mouth swab within hours of taking a bong rip lol.

For urine, there’s really only gonna be two options. Either you stop for the time leading up to the test, maybe try out a detox drink, even tho I heard most are garbage. Or..... quick fix. You could find it at any smoke shop. Never failed with quick fix. Use at your own discretion. "

"I am still upset about what Slott did to May and how this issue follows it up (except the awful costume change although they glossed over DeFalco's costume change) and Mayday being called Spider-Woman will never not be weird to me. But this issue by itself was good, Jody Houser can definitely write a good comic and I wouldn't mind her writing Mayday after this. 

I wish MJ and Peter were a bit more warm towards Mayday, she is another universe version of their stillborn daughter and she is around Annie's age too. But I guess they were too shocked, still hopefully after all this is done they do go and give her a hug.

I did like seeing MJ going in a corner and being upset about it though, I also liked how Peter asked if Anya was related to him (this also makes me wonder if Anya knows Peter's secret identity, at this point she has to know).

Hopefully we get to see some Annie and Mayday as sisters moment.

The art was also good, I loved that moment where Mayday takes off her mask and we see her face."

I'm not sure what's killing your mountain king but let me first go over the rules for it as it can be a bit tricky. First thing most people miss is that you have whelps in your list. This means when the mountain king gets punched it spawns 2 whelps. 1 from the whelp card ability (it spawns within 2"") another from whelp shedding (it spawns in base to base contact). Why does this matter? Because if something hits your mountain king you should be spawning a whelp to block the charge lane of whatever is coming in next.

Also when you charge in with mountain king try and make sure you know whats going to charge it back. Don't just look for that big heavy to kill, look for that big heavy and kill shot and then run something in front of MK to help him live. He's strong but he like most troll stuff they are not as tough as people think they should be."
People usually either sell these privately or trade them into a big dealer when they are getting another car.

"No, because Trump won for a variety of reasons. Not to do with anything that that guy was spewing.

Trump won because of election interference and a foreign campaign of misinformation.

Trump won because HRC's campaign was run poorly and not very strategically. Ignoring battleground states that Sanders' and Trump's campaigns correctly identified.

Trump won because the DNC has a public image issue. The DNC is recognized as the party of northeast and mid-Atlantic elites. The DNC as a whole is not good at conveying missions and messages in an comprehensible and contagious fashion. Trump's campaign was extremely successful at making their messages viral, poisonous or misrepresenting as they might be.

Trump won because of low-voter turnout. Minorities and young people who felt disenfranchised with the system or who felt forced to take a candidate they did not prefer did not come out to vote.

We shouldn't ignore all the factors that led to trump's victory because if we do it will lead to many more losses. With that said we should ignore bullshit like voter suppression, because that is uniquely a Republican problem. Look at Georgia where the Secretary of State is using his power to swing the election of governor to his favor through voter suppression."

Was is that after London Breed opposed Prop C he saw political opportunity to fuck her and set himself to run against her in 2019? He named a [co-CEO](http://fortune.com/2018/08/07/salesforce-keith-block-co-ceo-marc-benioff/) not long before that. That would explain why he's been so disingenuous about the impacts Prop C has on some businesses and his 'you're with the homeless or not' message. He's not a businessman anymore. He's a politician.

Instead I decided to stick around, because being best friend and FWB with the guy I loved wasn't that bad. I knew I would eventually get hurt in the process, I just hoped it never happened or that he would miraculoussly change his mind. This one is 100% my fault I got hurt. 

As for her, I made it clear from the beginning it was just a thing for fun. Crushes from high school don't count when you're 25, we both swore there was nothing even reassembling a beginning of feeling between each other, that we only ever saw the other as a friend.

So we define value, and it either works or doesn't (in creating a viable economic loop) but viable doesn't mean optimal, and I believe part of the role of government is to redistribute wealth to compensate for our lack of ability to glean true value of goods, thus leading to the types of issues we see in capitalism today."

I don't think it's fair to say ""all girls are bi"" because a) this was the case for both genders and b) a lot of the results only showed very minor signs of arousal when looking at gay porn, which could probably be explained by a lot of biological functions. 

For example, I'm a straight dude, but I objectively think some men are hot, like Donald Glover and Ryan Gosling. I don't want to fuck them, I never would fuck them, but obviously there is some kind of chemical reaction happening in my brain to let me know they are attractive. Doesn't make me bi.

The crates pay poorly, the missions aren't *that* fun, and they're very glitchy.

Bunker Supply missions are more fun than Hangar crates, and you don't even have to do them *if* you Buy Supplies and have the upgrades (no upgrades means you you don't make any profit if you buy supplies), because *normal paying* Terrorbyte and VIP Work takes less time to make up the $75K than doing 3-5 Resupply missions."

"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

"&gt;Rodger and Roof were essentially the first two alt-right terrorists.

""according to a new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center."" that's all you need to know from that link. The SPLC has turned into a joke and parody of what it is meant to be. Sharing a pepe meme would make you a default alt-righter according to them. Now, I DO Agree that Roof was a right-winger racist alt-righter. But it doesn't look like it had anything to do with Rodger's motivation. 

&gt;Islamic terror is inherently not left wing, as the goal of left politics is equal rights for everyone, and Islamic terror is based in an effort to deny people rights due to religious fundamentalism. And before you chime in with ""but the left is pro-Muslim!"", the left is pro-civil-rights, and the right wing's attempts to deny Muslims rights as a result of the actions of a massive minority of Muslims goes against the left's entire goal as an ideology, same as Islamic terror does.

You are so biased it's hilarious that you can't see it. You are starting from a point of ""left wing = amazing and right wing = terrible"" and only analyzing it from there. The same twisted logic you're using above can be used by right wingers to show that none of the alt righters are true right wingers either because they don't truly subscribe to right-wing philosophy. By your logic, it's basically impossible for anyone to commit a left wing terror attack because you'd just ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy it unless they are explicitly targeting Republican politicians and have no other explanation for it. Meanwhile, your ""right wing terrorist"" definition is so broad as to encompass essentially every other crime known to man. 

How about this guy? Left wing terrorist?  http://www.fox10phoenix.com/facebook-instant/man-who-threatened-to-kill-all-white-people-charged-in-6-murders\

Listen, Zeppelin is done with. We’re never getting a reunion, or more songs. So, if a band comes along that sounds HIGHLY like one of my all time favorites, I’m gonna give them a shot. 

They’re not original, they’re not as intense as Zeppelin, or even as good as them. But, they sound a hell of a lot like them, and that’s all I need. 

I have a fair share of variety of what I like, but probably 80% of what I listen to is 60s and 70s rock, with Zeppelin being my favorite of the Blues Hard Rock of the time, by far. People always say “just go listen to those Zeppelin records” Well, obviously I’m gonna, but after spinning each Zeppelin album like 1000 times (besides Coda) I kinda enjoy hearing something new that sounds almost exactly like them. 

GVF fill that long gone Zeppelin hole that I miss. I’m never gonna be able to see Zeppelin live, and while GVF aren’t them, at least I can get that eerily similar sound from them. 

New album while good, is a little disappointing. The double EP was their highlight so far. "

"1. In my personal experience, my reptiles get spooked when i accidentally spray them. No reason to do so if your humidity is at the right level anyway. 
2. A snake might be on the cheaper side based on the morph and its rarity, and who you buy it from. You can get a normal morph from a breeder for a fifth of the price you would find them at a pet store.
3. Which brings me to, you should probably avoid pet stores. They most likely don't know the history of the individual snake, even if they have very good knowledge of the species and its care (which is already rare in pet stores).

"I'm starting to feel that the real problem people are having with this particular R* issue is they want it to be black and white and it's just not that simple. There are complexities and nuances introduced just by managing a company/project of that size, there are lots of issues that come up with something that is both simultaneously someone's ""art"" or ""vision"" and also a commercial product, hell there are issues just with the idea that ""engineering is not a type of job that scales linearly"" which tons of internet comment sections have a hard time understanding (""they can just solve it with money!"" people will scream).

This isn't a case like the ivory trade where the entire process is bad and the end product only has value due to fake perception/marketing. There are lots of parts of the process that were good or even great. Even from the report you can clearly see that this isn't the product of a malicious company that intends to treat its employees like indentured servants, but the product of human misunderstandings, the nature of the work, and the scope they're trying to tackle.



It's not as simple as just saying ""They're good, it's fine!"" or ""They're bad, ban them!""

For example, let's say somehow we fully boycott RDR2 and no one buys it. Do we actually ""win""? Does anyone? Will any of those people who didn't get treated fairly now get compensated? Will any other studio say ""oh well obviously now the consumers care more about the process than the product""? Or will they just chalk it up to a bad PR move and continue moving forward? Will the reaction cause them to continue their trend of improving? Or double down back on their old practices?

It's not as simple as /r/games wants it to be.

So I can't tell you how to feel about it or how it should be. I can tell you personally I'm still going to buy it. I have friends who worked on it that have been excited to talk with me about it for months (if not more than a year or longer) and I can appreciate R* trying to improve itself. To me that's more notable than that they fell into the same management problem everyone else falls into."

"Well I decided to go ahead and speak with a recruiter.  I got ahold of a really nice TSgt and we talked for about 30 minutes.  He gladly answered all my questions and told me he will be more than happy to help me out when the time comes.

So for the weight:

 He confirmed they go by the standard height/weight chart that everyone goes by.  He did commend me on losing 50lbs already and said that it was already a great accomplishment.  Told me once I get closer (even if it's 15/20 lbs heavy) that to call him and we can talk more.  

The DUI issue:. 

He stated that if it reports ""NOT GUILTY/DISMISSED"" and that it is 10yrs old that it may not even be an issue where they need to do a waiver, but he said if there needs to be one done and I am willing to prepare all the documents needed then he will gladly process the waiver for approval.

We spoke for a while and I told him my story, etc and he said it seems like I am going about this the right way with a positive attitude and that once I lose the weight he will gladly drive the 2.5hrs to process documents. 

He finished with telling me that it seems like I'm a guy that would benefit the ANG and that the ANG would benefit me. 

All in all I feel much better after discussing my concerns with a local recruiter. 

I appreciate everyone taking the time to offer advice as well."

"I feel this is a matter of personal preference. My style of writing naturally mimics the show- not - tell method due to years of exhaustive objective writing  (thank you, psychology).  However, this is a style that can place a reader in the midst of the action or bring about a contemplative mindset.

Fredrik Backman incorporates this strategy in His emotionally- charged novels.  His writing style successfully lends itself to this method. Then again, I obviously enjoy this show not tell, so at the end of the day, is the audience tired or is the author?

"My mum was the first one to make me play piano, saying it was something to help my fingers become nimble and fast (I wanted to become a surgeon back then. Blame my childhood self.)

I never thought I'd like it at first. It seemed so monotonous, just hitting notes dictated by a piece of paper that the teacher would set in front of you. Eventually, I warmed up to it, and it became something of a challenge for me, to play increasingly difficult pieces and master them.

Then, I got to Musescore, where there were thousands of pieces ready to play, and I got hooked to it. I Googled every single piece of music I heard, whether it was on the radio, on some new anime, or even on Youtube, and search for its piano equivalent. Some were too hard (Bad Apple is hell.) and others were fairly easy.

It soon evolved from being a challenge to being an outlet for many things. Anger, melancholy, happiness...everything could be played on the piano, and people could listen.

Guess my inspiration for going back to the piano would be Arima Kousei, from Your Lie in April. "

"At first this seemed ridiculous, especially to me, someone who is generally a huge supporter of individual freedom.

But after thinking about it I think this could be extremely beneficial

First of all this would force everyone to develop social skills

Second social media is a massive cause of depression. Seeing people with amazing ""perfect"" lives on social media makes you feel worthless. Especially if you're young. 

Unfortunately there are also a few problems with this. Which make it hard to execute.

First of all you can not. There will always be parents that allow their kids on social media. If this is a significant amount this will create a MASSIVE culture gap. Which is something you'd rather avoid

Second of all how do you define social media? This essentially means that you can't allow kids to use the Fortnite chat either. 

And third social media also has a lot of benefits. It allows people to connect to eachother much more easily than was ever possible. Taking this away from kids is kinda regressive.

I think a better solution would be education about social media"

"First off i'll plug r/makinghiphop because that sub has a wealth of information and tutorials and like minded individuals.

As far as sampling beats goes there's a heap of ways to do it, you could go full retro and juggle vinyl samples on turntables, but the common way of doing it is on the computer, browsing YouTube and blogs for samples and stuff like that, or sampling from vinyl onto the computer.

You could look at getting a dedicated sampler like a Roland sp404sx or something, but, they're kinda expensive for people just starting out so my advice is to get a program like Ableton Live or Maschine and a MIDI pad controller. A ""lite"" version of Ableton is included with a heap of midi gear so you're only really dropping maybe $100 on a controller and getting the software too. Watch a few tutorials, mess around with it and soon enough you'll be making beats. Hardware stuff like the sp404 are really limiting too, where as a computer gives you a heap of options. Hardware can be more inspirational though, so you could learn the fundamentals on the computer and then get hardware.

Scratching vocals is done with turntables or DJ controllers. I like turntables better. It's kinda expensive to jump straight into though because if you wanna use your own samples through a computer you're looking at a DVS setup with Serato or a Traktor Z2, which gets pricey. I would say practicing scratch moves is harder than programming beats and stuff like that if you're a complete beginner with no sense of rhythm, and there's not as many resources available, it's more a self discovery/self expression way of teaching (for me at least)."

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

Bit of background: I normally work from home, but I had to come into the office for a few days, because I am applying for a new position and I wanted to shake hands and do an interview in person. It is about a 3.5 hour drive to the main office building, so my wife, our 2 kids, and I all planned to stay at a relatives house during this time. The relative’s house was empty(they were going to be on vacation during this time).

We drove over yesterday, but when we were about 45 min away from their house, they texted and said their vacation didn’t happen because their flights were cancelled by a hurricane. They forgot to let us know until just then. My wife had no intention of staying there while they were there too, so we was very upset by this and pleaded with me to find a hotel instead. We had no money for that, so I said we couldn’t do it. We sat there arguing for a long time, she was crying for most of it saying things like “I don’t want to go!” and “don’t make me go!”.

My only option was to drive her back home, but that would have added 5 hours to my night and it was already late, so I told her she had to suck it up and stay there anyways.

She continued crying and punching the roof of the car, and eventually I snapped and yelled at her, saying things like “Stop acting like a baby” and “Just suck it up and deal with it”.

Feeling bad about the whole thing this morning, just looking for a 3rd party perspective.

Edit: Wow, this blew up. Just to clarify, the reason she didn't want to go is because she doesn't want to deal with people and try and keep kids behaving by herself. Normally I work from home so I can help her, but in this situation she has no help and she feels overwhelmed. That is the reason she told me. I, like I said, think that's a crappy reason, and I kinda wanted her to suck it up. There is of course more to the fight and more was said, but typing it all out seemed like a hassle. I just included the worse parts for context.

Today, she says that she is sorry and that she feels like she acted badly. Ironically, the relatives ended up changing plans again, so they are out of the house anyways.

My wife has had issues with emotions/anxiety, and yesterday was an example of the worst of it.

"In the beginning, many of the migrants were taken by boat to islands off the coasts of Italy and Greece by human traffickers, where they were then carried to the mainland by government ships from those countries.

For the last several years, the standard procedure is to take them about ten miles off the northern coast of Africa where they are then met by NGO ships and carried the rest of the way.

Soros may be Jewish, and he may even be a zionist, but that doesn't mean he's unwilling to use migrants from the middle east and North Africa as a tool to destabilize the West. In fact, that is precisely his plan.

If the Swedes were so welcoming, then your ""brothers"" should be ashamed of the crime and social unrest they've inflicted upon their kind, albeit pathologically altruistic, hosts. It's an invasion pure and simple and there's going to be hell to pay for everyone involved."

Yes. Be sure your the address on your computer is correct in your router. You'll access it away from home using your actual ip followed by :8181. So for example: https://192.***.***.***:8181

The documents in this FOIA batch are already public, and can be found on the net. They date back to at least the 1990s, and they weren't created by the federal government or any of its agencies.

They were drawn up by people who believed in these things (but didn't have a clue how their imaginary machines might work).

The documents have been blown back into circulation to distract from the stuff of genuine interest that they were released alongside.

You know how radar operators refer to ""chaff""? It's from the old saying about winnowing the wheat from the chaff, meaning the bit you want from the useless junk.

These documents are chaff. A worthless distraction, deliberately published.

You think federal agencies wouldn't do this? Earlier this year, Nasa was caught planning to prank Alex Jones by ""leaking"" so-called evidence (of a man-eating monster on one of Jupiter's moons!) directly to InfoWars.

&gt; He doesn’t post about her on social media

Lots of people don't post about their relationship on social media. I'm engaged and I don't ever post about my relationship on social media.

&gt;I know just looking at someone doesn’t mean anything. It was more.

How do you know it was more? It's very easy to misinterpret a look someone gives. Especially when you're emotionally invested in said look.

Look, what seems to be happening is that you have a crush on him, you're projecting that crush onto him and now you're disappointed that you were probably wrong about what you thought he felt about you. It's okay to be disappointed, just don't be angry at him and act like he's been doing something wrong. I would recommend you stop looking at his GF's social media and stop engaging with him beyond what you need to do for class."

To answer your question, I don't know why. I would really like to know and I am not sure if she knows or not. It has not always been like this. We met later in life and I had multiple short term and long term partners and she was by far one of the best. Frequency was very high and more than half her initiation. And very adventuresome.  But two kids later and all has stopped. It is going to be the end of our marriage and that sucks. It has been going on for so long and we have grown so far apart I don't know what would have to happen for things to turn around."
"Conceptually, a Rust enum has two parts: the first is the discriminand signifying the variant, and the second is the payload. While the payload of an enum could be a reference, here the data is carried directly.

In this case the payloads are the i64 and the bool, though it could be anything, and the total size of the payload is the size of the largest variant's payload. Here that would be 8 bytes, because the i64 is 8 bytes wide, while the bool is 1 byte.

The size of the discriminand is more complicated. The Rust compiler can optimise an enum to combine the discriminand and payload *if* the payload has known  invalid values. For example, an `Option&lt;bool&gt;` is 1 byte wide because the compiler knows the payload has invalid bit states, and just uses one of those for the None variant (for example, 0 is `Some(false)`, 1 is `Some(true)`, 2 is `None`).

In this case, because the i64 has no invalid states, the compiler falls back to a separate discriminand. Here the size of the discriminand is 8 bytes. I think the compiler chose that here because it allows the discriminand to be carried in the same register as the payload. In the case where this won't work, it would probably use a byte unless  you had more than 256 variants.

Because of the optimisation I mentioned above, an `Option&lt;EditDate&gt;&gt;` would be the same size as a bare `EditDate`,  because the Option's discriminand would be combined with the EditDate's discriminand.

As for the similarity to Scala's Either type, it basically is an Either type but named specifically for this use. The Rust standard library doesn't have a general Either type, though it does have `Result&lt;T,E&gt;`, which is used specifically for error handling, so not appropriate here. As you can see, it's pretty trivial to create a new enum, and you can implement equality checking in the same way I did debug printing, so I've found I'll write a new type specific to my use case rather than use a [generic library](https://docs.rs/either/1.5.0/either/enum.Either.html).

Wow, that went on longer than I thought."

"&gt; Even Oculus reps themselves said ""it will take longer"" until we see a Rift 2

[citation needed]

&gt; with Rift 2 cancelled or at least delayed, possibly until 2022

Don't confuse /r/oculus opinion with fact. No one knows. Oculus has only said more info will come; until then, don't imply these statements are true because you'll only confuse people into thinking this was somehow confirmed.

The sub concluded a CV2 in 2020 before OC5. Then, after Abrash spoke, it concluded it would be 2022. These groupthink conclusions have always been based on varying degrees of pure speculation, reading between the lines, wishful thinking, and (sometimes) rudimentary understanding of the product development process. Nothing more.

A better way to express your opinion would be, ""with reports that the most-developed 'Rift 2' prototype was cancelled, it's possible that CV1's successor will be even later. In my opinion, if they wait too long (like, until 2022 to accommodate Abrash's predictions) there is also a chance it could be completely scrapped at some point.""

Point being, I think you make a good point - but try to avoid saying things that could restart a negative rumor mill that could affect VR as a whole."

"You raised a lot of great points and while I don't agree with all of them, I certainly agree with most of them.  You can really feel the absence of Bryan Fuller's hand (a hand that wrote Empok Nor, that experienced the writer's rooms of DS9 and Voyager), and feel the commercially-driven hand of Alex Kurtzman guiding the series (or at the very least putting it into the wrong hands).  Discovery feels more and more like its writing team is falling back on familiar tropes from this current generation of popular television.  The writing is more mechanical and formulaic, less driven by story and high-minded concepts.  In a world where many people believe making something 'dark' inherently means that it is 'interesting', I'm not too surprised by this.  But I am disappointed to see it in Star Trek.

&amp;#x200B;

Having said that, I've learned to never judge a Trek show before its third season.  Admittedly, the premise of Discovery (and the overreliance of Hollywood on prequels and remakes in general) feels very flimsy comparatively to other Trek series, but keep in mind that TNG experienced quite a coming out party when the writing room was restocked for season 3.  Do I have faith?  Being a Trek fan, I'm inherently an optimist but I will say that I'm worried and troubled by the show's apparent direction.  I'm not ready to give up, though.  I've got faith.  Faith of the heart.  (IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME...)"

"I used to have boring friends. Then I stopped hanging out with people who bored me with their boring topics of discussion and found friends in places of common interests eg art classes, poetry clubs, programming courses, alternative festivals etc. When you find interests and a place to participate in these interests, you will be more likely to find friends.

People can have emotional value, financial value, intellectual value, career value, or even value of just chilling and having a good time.

When I had boring friends, it's because they had the latest value but neither intellectual nor emotional value (sometimes). I would meet someone and we'd get along so well in this dance of boring and mundane discussion and I would think why don't I bring up this ""deep"" topic but they would seem to not care. 

These are people you would call acquaintances, not friends. I cut off all my old ""friends"" who I realized I could never really be friends with because we had nothing in common. Now when i meet people who seems similar to my oldies, I know their only value is acquaintanceship. No matter how much I enjoy spending time with them, they'll never be able to quench my thirst for philosophical/nerdy discussions so therefor I can either accept them for who they are but hold them at a distance or ignore them altogether. I do the first because I really do enjoy being around a variety of people, it's forming a deep bond with them that requires a niche unfortunately. 

It may seem selfish but I mean isn't a relationship really all about give and take? A transaction? If you think you have nothing to give, then it would be selfish to continue to take and if you think there's nothing to take, it's quite foolish to continue to give and expect for there to continue to be a transaction. 

tldr; Not everyone has to be your friend. "

"&gt; Some of our friends are saying that it's totally fine if he smokes weed while on probation 

Unless one of them is his probation officer, that's just, like, their opinion, man.

His probation conditions are the only thing that matter.     If his charges were drug related, it's possible that he will specifically be enjoined not to use cannabis.   Because his probation is being transferred to NH, it's up to the NH probation office's rules.   


Every probation order prohibits committing new crimes, and I'm sure he's aware that simple possession is a non-criminal civil violation in New Hampshire.   So that's not the problem.  


Overall, I'll give him a ""maybe"".    He should ask his PO.

"Damn, I thought it was another thing, that sucks EA is a joke"
"I wouldn’t say there’s one basic thing, process is very complicated but it can be broken down to a few simple things

Know what product it is you’re processing. For me, we get raw natural gas from the field at different pressures. We end up “separating” the gas into: Residue gas, also known as Methane, or C1. Followed by liquid ethane c2, propane c3, butane c4, and heavier hydrocarbons. So it goes in order from lightest to heaviest. It’s important to know the difference in chemical composition and boiling points. 

Learn the ins and outs of your plant. Where it physically comes in, at what pressure, flows temps etc., and where it goes out as what. Learning how pressure and temperature correlate to each other. 

The first thing to learn is probably the different systems amongst the plant. Fans, compressors, pumps, motors, valves etc. Most operators start out as outside operators. 

There is just so much it’s hard to pinpoint exactly where to start. Every company is different. However safety should always be the number one thing. I’m not going to bore you tho, by now you should know safety is everything. 

I’ve trained a couple guys that have started since me, because I know what worked for me and what didn’t. The thing I tell them to do ASAP is to trace every single pipe and know what’s in it, where it goes, at what pressure. Tracing pipe is the best thing you can do, whether you’re brand new or an operating veteran. 

As far as for the Interview, emphasize that you understand the safety culture within the organization. Emphasize your strong points, whatever they may be. There’s probably tens of different kinds of operators, all contribute in different ways. They know that know one comes in already knowing the job. Show them that you’re willing to do whatever it takes to learn, ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 

EDIT: just read your original comment, I may have gone off road a bit. To prepare for your entrance exam, I would research about how the place works, chemically and physically. The number one trait of an operator is the ability to troubleshoot and act on your feet. Also, how to figure things out. My operator entrance exam went like this:

If it’s 80 outside and certain variable is getting too hot, what do you do? Answer turn off a fan. 

If your tower temperature is getting too low, what will happen and how to fix? Answer is: desired product will be off spec, since the lighter components will not separate. Add temperature using a reboiler. If it’s not working, check your heaters. Basically work your way back"

You are completely ignorant of what you are are talking about. There is no such thing as ""just a swtich"" that will magically drive a display let alone two. If you disconnect the displays from the SOC and its supporting components, you have to provide a replacement display driver and all the electronics necessary to support HDMI or whatever connection technology you choose. On top of that, you have to provide the firmware and software necessary to get the sensor data from the device to the PC and then the software to process it. 

So please, educated me. Tell me where to order this magic *switch* that will take and HDMI connection and drive two pentile displays while also magically interfacing with the SOC to transfer the sensor data. Oh, and to be trivial and work with VR, it has to add less than 10ms of latency to connection."

As for Waco, not much else they could have done in my opinion. The classic rebuttal to that is “they could’ve left David Koresh alone”, but call me old-fashioned for thinking that pedophiles and illegal firearms owners should be prosecuted in a court of law.

I'm not saying not to use bootcamp, but if your school has a software agreement that allows you to get VMWare as well, you should take advantage of that. Try it out because it might be a better solution than bootcamp for you -- it works a lot better for me and takes up less storage."

&amp;#x200B;

This year in particular many pro players have come out and said how KR soloq is a lot better. So LS bashed for something he is saying for years ( KR Soloq being a lot better) then pro players come and say the same thing and they re wrong as well?? Why all those people who make a living on the game and are involved in the scene and have experienced all soloqueues and have more experience and they are better on the game and better at analyzing are wrong but some random guys at reddit are right when they re saying that those people are wrong?"

"Our assurance of salvation is simply this:

We are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone as revealed in scripture alone. Our faith is a free gift from God which He has promised to create and strengthen through His Word and Sacraments. (Rom 10:17)

Consider John 14:6 (ESV)
&gt; Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

There is no salvation separated from Christ upon whom our faith grasps for our salvation.

However, God is not limited by the means He has provided to us which He uses to create and strengthen faith. He can work faith where and when He wills, even in those who cannot comprehend or articulate that faith, like infants (Psa 22:9) or those who have not been reached through evangelism.

Additionally, recall that God has promised not to lose anyone He knew would be in heaven with Him since before the beginning (Revelation 13:8, Ephesians 1:4, 2 Timothy 1:8–9, 1 Peter 1:18–20, Titus 1:2, Ephesians 3:11).

A natural question is to ask what role do works play in our salvation...?

The answer is: none at all

Good works are a sign of and result from faith. As James wrote, faith without works is dead. For those who do no good works have no faith and works without faith are not good in the eyes of God. All of the good works we perform are prepared for us by God and because of our faith, given by God, we perform them, not as an act of will on our part, but because the Holy Spirit within us moves us to do so.

This is a great quote from Luther:

&gt; Faith is something living, something active...Faith is not idle, loose thought...There is something busy, active, and powerful about Faith, so that it is impossible for it not to do Good Works without ceasing. Faith does not ask if Good Works need to be done. It has already done them and is still doing them before even being asked.

What are these works? Who knows. They could be a smile at the right time to a person who needed it, acting well in a vocation, saving a child, or any number of other things big or small. These works, whatever they are, have already been done and will continue to be done by those with faith. This is what faith does.

You may enjoy this humorous video:

[Marty and Frank Part II: Romans 3](https://youtu.be/t0BGf0Aj-lg)

Mark 16:16 (ESV)
&gt; Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.

Rom 10:9 (ESV)
&gt; ...if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

Eph 2:8-10 (ESV)
&gt; For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them

Rom 3:20 (ESV)
&gt; For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.

Rom 3:28 (ESV)
&gt; For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.

Rom 4:1-8 (ESV)

&gt; What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.” Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:

&gt; “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;
blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.”

Rom 5:1-2 (ESV)

&gt; Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

Titus 3:4-7 (ESV)
&gt; But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life."

"These look okay, but I have some comments.

&amp;#x200B;

1) A couple of reps are borderline, but the depth isn't bad enough to explain your deadlift stall.   


2) Are you actually bracing really hard? As in getting in a LARGE breath and locking down your abs, back, etc? It doesn't look like it from the video.

&amp;#x200B;

3) I think you're looking too far down. I realize that it's annoying with the mirror in front of you, but can you try looking a little more forward (not forward, but at a spot that would be like 10 ft in front of you on the ground)?"

Hmm that’s interesting. Something to mention to the therapist then I guess lol.
"Kotkaniemi is getting sheltered minutes, though, whereas the Danault line is being matched against the other team's top players. His success is due largely t that.  It's a long season for an 18 year old. Better to give him those sheltered minutes or he could get hurt. He has nowhere the speed, strength, aggression or offensive sense of  Danault. 

Also, Kotkaniemi is missing way more chances than Armia, mostly after Armia's strong board work  sets KK up in front of the net.  Armia's strenght on the puck and one-on-one  work in  dirty areas in front of the net and in the corners opens things up for Byron and KK in front of the net. Right now, Armia is slowly becoming the closest thing Habs have  to being a power foward. Armia needs to adjust to his new more offensive role and overcome his defensive instincts, and there's no better person to do that with than KK. 

I'll also add that chemistry between Armia and KK is plap\[able and growing.  One knows where the other is. Adding Byron to that line has already leveraged that chemistry for a goal. It's the perfect third line right now.  "

"I get what OP is saying. YES, we have had an easy run but 7 PL wins, 10 in all comps, in a row is incredibly difficult to do no matter who the competition is. Tottenham lost to Watford, Chelsea drew West Ham, United lost to Brighton, etc. We may be expected to wins these games when you look at them on an individual basis but over the course of 5+ games it's more likely to have dropped points here or there.

If Tottenham or United was on the same streak we are on they would be getting praised for their consistency and their ability to ""get the result""."

"Interesting topic!

It is hard to tell based on stats, because they are relative. But my guess is, it is a combination of your mental state and your decision making ingame, which are maybe both bad/lacking. You will know it better than i am, just be honest to yourself!

Listen to n0thing's rant about [Consistency and solo queuing](https://youtu.be/N97f_uh2WAQ), maybe that gives you a better idea about your problem.

Other than that, i would recommend joining one of these Pro League faceit hubs from your country (if there is any), they are made for solo queue players and they often use a voice program (at least in my country) which makes communication generally better than the normal/premium faceit queue. And communication plays obviously a big part in winning games, especially at a higher level.

"So what do you do when you come across a murderer that literally has no emotion when it comes to valueing human life??? What about sociopaths that kill? What about sadists that do it to get off? What about terrorists that do it for God or country?

"If you don't mind a steep learning curve, Crusader Kings 2 is very deep with a lot to learn and experience.  It's not heavily hardware dependent either. 

 It's a grand strategy ""real time with pause"" dynasty simulator where you arrange marriages, tutor children, recruit members for your court, and manage a ruling family through many generations.  There are politics, intrigue, religion, and battles/wars.  I put over 100 hours into one game and still didn't get to the date when the game ends.  If you like games like this, then you could put a ton of time in and still go back for more.

It's playable without buying DLC, but if you do decide you want that too, then I'd say get ""The Old Gods"" first since I'm a fan of Vikings and you get to start in 867 instead of 1066 and play as a Viking if you want."

"Pasta from prior comment I made:

So I just woke up and saw this. In my emerging terrorism threats course , I did a presentation on domestic terrorism. My professor was profoundly offended that I focused on white supremacists as they are responsible for nearly all acts and attempted acts of domestic terrorism. He wanted me to focus on homegrown violent extremists, which according to him are domestic terrorists who are inspired by acts abroad, which was his thin excuse for telling us domestic terrorists are Islamic jihadists. I got a 50 because I refused to focus on his frankly racist belief. I feel vindicated and dismayed.

The idiots making policy are stuck in this circular trap believing that Islamic individuals are the ones committing acts of domestic terrorism. The truth is, hundreds or thousands died from KKK freedom rides, in which they'd hunt down black people, tar and feather them, hang them, or wait and hang them in front of *the entire town* as a form of *entertainment*. 

They did this from the end of the Civil War til the end of the Civil rights era. So, a good century of white domestic terrorism. Including attempted acts, the far right has performed about 120 acts of domestic terrorism from 2008 to 2016, with about 60 acts from Islamic Americans/legal residents. 

So our policy makers keep focusing on the minority, while the majority is the bigger problem. We need to face the fact that Conservativism has proven to be fertile ground for domestic terrorism for over a century. Trump has pushed suggestions of violence against the press, liberal politicians and civilians, and admired dictators for their ability to use state sponsored violence to enact policy.

This could be the Reichstag fire I've been fearing. Whether or not Trump is involved beyond inspiring domestic terrorism, I have no doubt he'd like to use this to both mock the recipients of the bombs and claim it shows liberals are hated by the good citizens though isn't it unfortunate people are forced to mail bombs as political protest against unpopular liberal ideas.

Vote. The alt-right is making attempts at assassination now. "

"I would expect someone guilty to remain completely quiet and never try and draw ANY attention to themselves. I'm sure i'm in the minority here, but this is actually how I would expect someone that's being accused of something they didn't do to react. If someone kept saying I did something and I didn't, at some point, i'm going to loose my shit and flip the fuck out.

That being said, if ST is innocent, he should be doing all he can to clear his name. Then again, maybe he's weary of submitting to testing, thinking he could somehow be framed with his DNA being used against him somehow, just like the state allegedly did to SA.

Either way, people saying he's 1000000000% guilty because he's flipping out over being accused are really jumping the gun imo. Avery wrote some pretty awful letters and did some awful things himself that one could easily say can be used as examples of someone who would hurt a woman."

"You’re definitely not alone.  As I said below, this is the one thing that comes up every thread that actually make people with a “I was born this way” feature feel bad.   Guys pile on every time.

If you notice everything else in this thread is a choice: like baby talk, food, working out, or something everyone has: feet.

After being on reddit I am fairly convinced every guy vomits over anything larger than a 34B.

"Never said you claimed he was any of those guys, I simply listed post scorers who’s usage stemmed from the post, and were primarily back to the basket?

I keep saying the same thing over and over again and it’s like ya can’t understand. Embiid can score in the post yes, but is still struggling extremely against the best defenders because his back to the basket game is comparatively weak to his face up skills. 

This is not to mention I think as soon as Embiid learns to dream shake, improves his back to the basket game and including hooks, he will literally be like a top 5 two way player in the league, but without it he is like top 15"

"You're very welcome, i'm always happy to have a civil debate where both sides can learn and grow. 

Capitalism is the justification for the demand. So long as there is money to be made, the demand will be met as best it can. It would be preferable to try and do gene editing so we could have larger cows instead of more cows, but people have a fit about gmo's even though they have not had any known negative impact in 10-20 years. At least to my knowledge. 

As for the recycling of proteins from plants we'd have to look at the body and organ structure of cows. Cows have a very odd digestive system from humans in that theirs is longer. They have four stomaches in fact so they can properly break down their food and extract the nutrients and proteins. Humans can't do this. Plants play a bit of chemical warefare with animals in an attempt to not be eaten. Herbivores work around this with specialized digestive tracks, but omnivores and carnivores are kind of shit out of luck with raw plants. We as humans have the work around of cooking our food. This takes the harmful chemical in plants that make it not unsafe to eat, but it can make you very sick. I skimmed this website for some examples and they provide plenty. The most noteable to me was that there is a grass pea that causes lathyrism. Which i guess is a rare but deadly condition. The most well known example of it's deadlyness was in nazi concentration camps they fed the prisoners bread  with flour made from the seeds. You'd think cooking the bread would solve the issue, but the prisoners had literal death by bread. And not the 'oh we were starving and ate too much rich food so we died via internal shock' but because of lathyrism. Here is the link. 

https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/10/01/228221063/when-edible-plants-turn-their-defenses-on-us

So yes, we can find ways to prepare most plants, but plants don't want to eaten. Instead of struggling for their life, they hold the metaphysical knife of chemical warfare and basically say 'i fucking dare you pussy bitch.' Plants are metal dude. They want to survive as much as anything or anyone else. A 'lack of a brain' is more of a nice excuse more than a real reason. Plants have their own brain in a sense, it is very primitive, like a baby or animal. They lack the need for most sensory receptors because what good would it do to the plant to know that a cow is nearby. It can't run away. It just needs to know where sunlight is, which it grows toward, temperature, so it doesn't just die in winter but proceeds to go into a hibernation state like how grass does so we don't have to replant our lawn every spring, and i'm sure it senses other things but i wasn't exactly a straight a student in biology.          But i'll get back on topic, we need the animals to process those dangerous chemicals for us, thus we can eat the meat where the good things are stored. 

Plants can sense pain, if they can sense pain then they obviously have the computing power of 'does this hurt? Don't go there.' Plants are pretty metal though, they will do a bunch of shit to get their 'job' done. Wether that be 'grow to sunlight' or 'grow roots deeper for more moisture' like, trees destroy concrete because they are thirsty. Imagine busting through your kitchen wall because you want a glass of water, that is how a plant do. 

In the end, it is survival of the fittest. Humans are at the top of the food chain for our use of tools and 'intelligence' so we feed on everything below us. Some take 'everything' more literally. Some stick with the very bottom of the food chain, namely plants and vegetarians. But in reality, some plants produce poisonous shit because they want you to fall dead at their feet and then they can use your delicious body as nutrients. That's the cycle of life, but some plants actively strive for it. Carnivorous plants are a good example of this as well. 

To my knowledge, veal is baby calf meat. I see no good qualities about it myself, but if you got the money then you can get what you want, that's the whole shtick of capitalism. I don't know anything about tying them up for muscle growth, i just thought it was 'you're three months are up little fella'. And that was veal. Google also tells me that veal is just calf meat, doesn't even matter the gender. So i guess i am also in the dark on that part. 

We all have something to learn, in one area or another all of us are ignorant. But on that scale you can't help but chuckle at least. If we had a reduction in the demand for meat then no one would see any reason to keep up the production of crops either. Best case scenario they would replant the forests, worst case scenario a weed like plant would take over that land. Capitalism is the driving force, so if you remove the monetary incentive then the companies see no need to continue to throw money at those farms.          If you'll allow me to go off topic again i'll try to use a good analogy. There are tax breaks for big ticket luxury items that only super rich people can afford. To those at the bottom this is a 'oh, great, more tax breaks for the rich, fucking rich ass holes with all their money they won't give me or put me through doctors college with.' But in reality that tax break is an incentive to buy that item from the company who made it, who pays thousands of people to design, build, and sell that big ticket luxury item. It's a tax break that aims to keeps jobs and maybe even make new ones. Because if no one buys private jets, then the people who make private jets go out of business, and everyone in that business also loses their jobs. Much like if cow farm owners don't need cow feed, then the suppliers of cow feed no longer have a buyer and thus lose their jobs and likely land when they go under.       I guess it's a kind of necessary evil.

I do, cheese is my weakness as well as mustard, that second part is less relevent but i said it anyway. I also enjoy a nice meatball and meatlovers pizza is better than cheese and 99% of vegetarian pizza is absolute garbage.

"You can't have a game that is both challenging and enjoyable for everyone involved if there is no balance between the PCs.

If one person outshines everybody else because they are optimized while others aren't, it creates an impossibility for the DM to create a challenging experience for everyone. Challenges will either be trivial for the optimized PCs or insurmountable for the PCs that aren't.

The easiest way to make sure PCs don't outshine each other is to make sure that most options are relatively balanced. I'm not saying Strength wizard has to be as good as a fighter in melee but if I use a class in a clearly intended way (e.g. most classes with the two-weapon fighting style) then I should be able to party up with a character that fights two-handed and PAM without feeling like I made a horrible mistale every combat."

"The final episodes of ATLA and the way the gaang were treated in ATLK never gelled with me. 

Particularly the big buildup to the final battle with Ozai. There's all this dramatic tension about having to let go of his love for Katara in order to regain the avatar state, and in the end it's resolved via a particularly strong back massage?

And afterwards, Aang doesn't seem to be changed by the experience at all, and that carries on through his life as Avatar. And then, just to remain unsatisfying, he dies young.

It feels like the trick good ending at the end of an RPG, the one you get when you finish the game without finishing some of the necessary side quests, and your character never learns out who **really** was the killer and therefore never defeats the **real** big bad, who remains waiting for the right moment to take over the world."

https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/NXEN/news/INTIVA-BioPharma-OTCQB-NTVA-Files-a-Listing-Application-with-the-Canadian-Securities-Exchange-CSE?id=201731 “Since Toronto has become the world financial center for cannabis and cannabinoid pharma-related financings, it became clear that a Canadian stock market listing would be beneficial for INTIVA in potentially accessing capital from global investors and developing increased trading activity of the Company's shares.""



Nexien BioPharma (OTC QB: NXEN) has 200,000,000 Authorized Shares and 43,880,896 Outstanding. The float, as of October 24, 2018 was only 1,499,026 That’s a very, very small float. As of July 27, 2018, NXEN (formerly NTVA) has a Market Cap of only $16.6 million (at 38¢). You can check out OTCmarkets.com for more information.
First, INTIVA BioPharma has a nice management and director line-up:
* Alain Bankier / CEO, Chief Strategist – If you simply Google his name, you’ll see he’s been a part of various Cannabis industry events — like Canna Tech, Cannabis Learn Conference &amp; Expo, and the Cannabis World Congress &amp; Business Exposition in New York. You can watch/listen to an interview he did with PotBotics. Alan Brochstein from New Cannabis Ventures wrote an article in January 2017 where it started with, “Well-known cannabis investor”. It goes on to talk about his involvement (co-founder) with New York Angels, which has more than $100 million invested in more than 200 ventures. He’s the Co-Founder and Managing Director of VS Tech Ventures, which was “created as an innovative program providing legal cannabis companies access to leading professional service providers, to help entrepreneurs build their businesses, in a cash efficient fashion and to help accelerate company traction, while continually increasing shareholder value”. Mr. Bankier is also an Advisor to New Frontier Data, whose “mission is to elevate the discussion around the legal cannabis industry globally by providing unbiased vetted information and educating stakeholders to make informed decisions.” Mr. Bankier owns more than 2.25 million shares of NTVA, according to the S-1 filed/amended on June 19, 2018.
* Kevin McGovern / Advisor, Director – Mr. McGovern was a founder of SoBe Beverages, which most of you should recognize — they sold to PepsiCo in 2000 to $370 million. Mr. McGovern is the Chairman &amp; CEO of McGovern Capital, which even lists the Intiva logo on their website under Investments. On the McGovern Capital website it mentions that Kevin has co-founded (through McGovern Capital and its affiliates) more than 25 companies — 6 of which have become world/category leaders! “McGovern Capital, LLC” owns 751,113 shares of NTVA, according to the S-1 filed/amended on June 19, 2018.
* Lindy Snider / Advisor, Director – Ms. Snider is the Founder and CEO of ‘Lindi Skin’, which is Specialty Skin Care for Cancer Patients. Watch her interview with PotBotics, as she discusses Cannabis investments. Ms. Snider is a dedicated philanthropist and she is an active board member of many non-profit organizations: Fox Chase Cancer Foundation, Cancer Forward, The Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation, The Snider Foundation, to name a few. Lindy is the daughter of the late Ed Snider, the owner of the NHL’s Philadelphia Flyers, who had a net worth of $2.5 billion according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. Ms. Snider is also a Director of Kanativa, a privately-held Canadian corporation which is involved with Alexa’s Botanicals — who has a line of CBD products. Lindy was said to have 440,000 shares as of the S-1 filing.

        Beyond the successful people that are running the show, it’s important to point out that NTVA does not “touch the plant,” or any derivatives of the plant. They are proceeding with its research and development activities using U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved protocols, using the synthetic cannabinoid molecules, Dronabinol and Marinol.
NTVA’s drug development strategy consists of:
* The acute treatment during exposure to organophosphorus nerve agents, including sarin gas. (This could be a big deal for the Middle East, where we hear about ‘Chemical Warfare‘ more commonly. Most recently in Syria.)
* The treatment of various symptoms related to myotonic and muscular diseases such as dystrophia diseases.
* The treatment of  various symptoms related to lipidosis, which are genetic disorders which are characterized by defects of the digestive system that impair the way the body uses dietary fat.
* The treatment of  various symptoms related to lipofuscinosis, in particular neural ceroid lipofuscinosis and macular degeneration associated with lipofuscinosis, which is any disorder associated with the abnormal storage of lipofuscins. Lipofuscins is a yellow to brownish pigment granule found in the muscle, heart, liver, kidney, adrenal, retina and nerve cells undergoing slow regressive changes and accumulating in lysosomes with age.
* The treatment of restless legs syndrome. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) otherwise known as Willis-Ekbom Disease and Wittmaack-Ekbom Syndrome is a term used to describe a neurological sensory disorder that also interferes with sleep and is thus also considered a sleep disorder. RLS may affect up to 8% of the population, according to Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation.
* Sexual health affecting both males and females. Male sexual health issues or dysfunction issues include male erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders, such as premature ejaculation, anorgasmia (inability to achieve orgasm) and desire disorders such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (lack of interest in sex). Female sexual health issues or dysfunction issues can be defined as the difficulty or inability of a woman to find satisfaction in sexual expression.
To catch you up to speed on what was announced in the last month:
* On June 28, 2018, NTVA announced it has filed a utility patent application with the US Patent Office “relating to the use of cannabinoids to treat myotonia, myotonic dystrophy and other related dystrophies”.
* On July 12, 2018, NTVA announced Germany-based Dr. Benedikt Schoser as an Advisor. Dr. Schoser is said to be one of the world’s top researchers in both molecular mechanisms of muscle loss and myotonic dystrophy.

"&gt;It was nowhere near full PSY all the time, lol.

Okay now you clearly have no experience with [Judge](/psy) if you dont think double Judge had 90-100% PSY orbs when using his special. His increased appearance from both CA's PLUS the special's increased appearance made PSY orbs come up almost guaranteed. Almost. 90%. so going from 90% to 100% aint a huge upgrade. Its only slightly. 

&gt;Awfully obtuse here pal.

Im using literally your same logic to prove you wrong.

&gt;Judge will get his multiplier easier thanks to no negative orbs and literally guaranteeing orbs...

Its slightly easier sure, since youre forgetting his increased INT orbs mean that both Judges will roll more PSY/INT orbs, so you dont have the same chance to get negative orbs like normal teams. Its a slight benefit.  

The fundamentals of the multipliers are quite literally the same though. 

Also

&gt;ATK boost is better because orb boosts are not hard to find for any class or team.

Dude its fundamentally worse when ATK and Orb boosters are everywhere, but Judge limits himself to three classes. I mean a glaring example is that [Judge](/int) doesn't boost a friend lead's [G4 V2](/qck)'s atk, while [Judge](/psy) still can boost orbs for them. "

"So I don't think too many people understand this, but the US defense budget is so large because our military contract companies (Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed, Northrup Grumann) aren't allowed to sell to just anyone. Imagine if you ran a country where a private company was selling super advanced weapons to your adversaries. How bad would that be?

Instead these big companies sell their jet fighters and missile defense systems to the US government, who acts as a middle man to sell to US allies. Much of the defense budget goes to buying from defense contractors and selling to other nations. So when you see the US spending so much on the military, it's because the whole military industrial economy of the US has to pass through the defense budget. Other countries don't spend nearly as much on defense because the market just doesn't allow for them to do the same. They'd be like a tiny startup competing against Walmart and Costco (where Walmart and Costco are the US and Russia in this analogy). It's more effective to have an economy based on something else and buy the weapons you need from the US and Russia."

As the author of that thread notes, this may not be the appropriate solution for all daemons and some research and testing will be necessary for whatever daemon is causing issues. If you do run into problems with the script you should be able to remove it without issues. "

"How do I stop lying?

It's just so easy. I don't mean to harm or hurt anyone. But sometimes I just lie about the most basic things.

The hardest step was accepting that I lied again if someone confronted me. Since then I still lie but I always feel super horrible afterwards. I managed to not lie about major things at least. But it still happens that I lie about some small stuff. And it really kills me inside a few moments later when I realize I just lied. It's not like you can take it back easily. People will not believe you that what you told them first was totally made up and a lie...

This is horrible I need help, don't want to end up hurting people like I read in all these strays in this thread."

Unfortunately, they tried to low-ball me on compensation.

"Just to be sure everyone knows about the charging thing, some facts around the issue:

* There is a Qi standard that charges up to 5w.  Everyone uses this standard -- Apple, Samsung, old school Nexus 5s, everyone.
* There is a Qi standard that handles up to 15w.  Razor is the only device that uses this (that I'm aware of).  No one else does.  
* Samsung has created their own wireless fast charging protocol that handles 10w.  Many 3rd party chargers implement this standard.
* Apple has created a second proprietary protocol that handles up to ~~10w~~ 7.5w fast charging.  Many 3rd party chargers implement this standard.  It is not compatible with the Samsung protocol.
* Google now has implemented a third proprietary standard that handles up to 10w fast charging. So far, just the Pixel Stand implements this protocol.  It too, is not compatible with the Samsung or Apple protocols.

I have money set aside specifically for that purpose. But I don't want my credit to show ""settled"", I want it to show ""paid in full"" because that IS the full amount I actually owe."

Are you going to therapy? Your medication may indeed need an adjustment but I’m just checking what you are doing in between sessions to help yourself. The medication is the vehicle that helps with the physical symptoms but of course you wanna compliment that with going to a counselor to treat the roots or the problem, plus get good coping mechanisms for the bad days.

I write and paint as well because it makes me happy, and I practice Krav Maga and I sleep like a baby after kicking and punching the bag, it helps take out all that pent up energy so there’s no more energy for my body to spend on being on edge. 

Hope that’s a start!"

"I slapped together a mini-ITX parts list while waiting for this disaster of a rally to start.


Component | Part | Price
------|---------------------|---:
Mobo  | MSI B450 mini-ITX   | 115
CPU   | Ryzen R5 2400G      | 160
RAM   | 2x4GB DDR4 3000     | 80
SSD   | MX500 M.2 250GB     | 55
PSU   | EVGA 450W B3        | 50
Case  | Thermaltake Core V1 | 45
Total |    | $505

Use case: media playback and some very light work. I was looking for a case that measured less than 10 inches tall and was no more than 12 inches wide or deep; the Thermaltake above just barely fits the bill.

Couldn't quite get it to total less than $500, but I came close. It would be easier if there were an AM4 mini-ITX motherboard that sold for less than $115."

So it definitely was a thing. Who still has the supplement to their cardmember agreements and wants to see if this is still there?

"I said this last time too, but to listen to me Jon. You're driving yourself crazy with Tanistry trying to align all the votes and you're just letting the AI boss you around. The only kingdom title you need is Wales because your demense is there. Ireland and Brittany mean nothing, and with Ireland especially it would make your life easier since you wouldn't have to deal with all the Irish dukes anymore. Not to mention your vassals desire those kingdoms and its just straining their opinion unnecessarily. Also wouldn't kill you to destroy your extra duchies so you're within the two duchy limit while you're at it for the same reason.

Once the extra kingdoms are out of your hair, you need to ditch Tanistry on Wales and the Empire in favor of Primo/Ultimo. Considering you have trouble educating your heirs, I would actually suggest you go for Ultimo (note: remember educating your kids yourself usually yields better results and you are allowed change the suggested guardian). Then to avoid the problem of ending up with a young child on the throne, you join a monastic order and become celibate / divorce your wife / marry an older woman.

Edit: On an unrelated note, that crusade wasn't worth it. You're not even getting the whole kingdom, and even if you were it's kinda dodgy considering how blobby the are Muslims are in your game. Either way, you just rang dinner bell for the entire Muslim world to come after you."

"I had to go somewhere in the 450, no trailer. I put a dial gauge in a place where I could measure the body travel independent of the frame. I went up 95, through a neighborhood, drove off-road to a place where my dog could run around a bit, and through a shitty parking lot. The maximum travel for the entire trip was .8 inch. The Dodge 1500 I drove to ucf is sitting in the back of my shop with the motor out of it at the moment. I happened to know the fender clearance before I pulled it. I just measured it and it is 2 inches higher without the engine. 

&amp;#x200B;

In case you have forgotten, the original question is what the hell are you doing in the parking garage that would cause you to experience 3-5 inches of travel? The answer, of course, is nothing.

"Starting E without blockers has shown great results and less adverse effects, as it helps your body building estrogen receptors before cutting the T. I know that having T in your system sucks, but having basically no usable hormones due to a lack of receptors has shown some serious side effects in some people. So far your doctor just seems careful and wants to give your body a more natural hormonal transition. He should increase your dosage after 6 weeks and add an anti androgen soon, if not ask him why and if you don't agree with his explanation ask him to increase your dosage. Keep a close eye on your blood tests. Some people can reach female hormone levels with low dosages while others need high dosages. A higher dosage does not give better results and ever person is different. "

"Assuming they'd want to make their own story from the ground up, I'd doubt they'd be able to secure AAA financing these days. Now, the only ""blank check"" directors are Kojima and whatever the Housers at Rockstar are working on at the moment. In the past couple years, we've seen interesting risks with big budgets, but they've mainly been within established franchises, like Zelda &amp; God of War. In addition, those are more difficult to assign to the work of a single auteur. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's tremendous amount of auteur's in the independent field and a number of low-to-mid budget works, like Nier. I could see them getting some mid-budget money from, say, Square or Activision. But I think the most likely outlet is Sony or Microsoft bringing them in for a new first-party franchise, like Kojima. Not sure they'd get as much of a leash as they'd demand. "

"Honestly, unless you're going to take the first good offer that comes your way, you will need to put in some legwork to get things priced accurately or find someone who knows what they are doing to take a look through it all to get an approximate value of the collection. There's just too much here for someone to finger through and make a quick guess.

The best approach is to use TCGplayer low values for a card that matches your card exactly (so the set/rarity/condition) as the base value. If there isn't one, lowest ebay price is a better comp than other sites. From a brief browse of your collection, you've got at least a few good cards (The 1st ed Dark Armed, 1st ed Yata Garasu, 1st ed LOB Raigeki, some of the older ultis, the DUEA Dantes, among others), but you also have a lot of stuff that's not going to really be looked at from a collector or player. 

Selling bulk on ebay can be difficult if you're trying to get maximum value though. The problem being, as the price of those items increases due to quantity, the smaller the market of interested parties is, because they typically can just buy everything they want from the collection as singles elsewhere, so the bigger the collection, the bigger the discount needs to be to draw interest.  

It may be easier depending on where you live to try to sell locally; go to a local card shop, talk to a few players, and see if there is a facebook group or a card shop that would be ok with you bringing in a collection to sell (DON'T just bring it in to a shop without checking; many aren't cool with external sales). Someone may be willing to make an offer, but depending on how big of an area (and the local competition is), you might not get any bites, especially with a collection this large. You could also try to sell it here, but a) you'll need to have a price in mind before doing so, and b)  it may be difficult given your lack of experience selling something that large. 

If you have any other questions, I'm willing to answer!"

"I guess I have an unpopular opinion but after a recent viewing, I think Halloween II has just not aged well. 

I really like the original and Halloween 3: Season of the Witch is also great but Halloween II really suffers because Laurie is not written as well. She is groggy and out of it for most of the movie; not the strong heroine from the first film and I think it suffers because of that. Also Loomis goes completely off the chain in a way that I find distracting.

The only thing I really like is that it picks up immediately after the events of the first film - which was a great idea but it just wasn't well written.

And, as an anime fan i agree. Some anime characters are soooooooo white. Some are clearly stated to be like Attack on Titan which is set in Europe. But even the ones in Japan, the characters look more caucasian than asian; like if you cast a white guy they'd look more accurate than a japanese casting. Take the leads of Blue Exorcist Rin and Yukio https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IT1lgRspL.jpg they look so white. You could cast Asa Butterfield and any brunette white boy and they'd look more accurate to the anime tbh

"One way to look at it is this: You can define a method that takes a parameter of type JOHN, and JOHN can have a method called talk(). But every single time that you add a new class that has the talk() method, you need to define another method that can take that new class.

&amp;#x200B;

Now say you have an interface called ITalk with one method, talk(). Now you can define a method to take an interface of type ITalk. You can rest assured that every class that implements ITalk can be passed to that method.  You can pass any class that implements ITalk to this method, and the method will still work. This provides us with a way to keep our code extendable.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little confused by the last part of your first paragraph, to me it seems like you think that interfaces define the implementation of the method. That is not true, you cannot define a method implementation in an interface. All you can do is create the method declaration. The classes that implement the interface will be forced to create an implementation of that method. If you need to define a generic implementation, you should look towards abstract classes.

"I’d argue he doesn’t flat out beat warden because warden is not committed to his bash when he starts it. The warden matchup is just very mind game filled. And since he can be guardbroken in the beginning of the attack it’s simple enough to bait the dodge. And I think tiandi having instant superior block would make the attack much more usable against good opponents. As is it takes 300 ms for superior block frames to start, which last for 200 ms. Meaning against a 500 ms attack, you need to react to and input the correct direction and light in 200 ms in order to catch that attack. Which makes it next to unusable against light attacks. And it’s just like every other superior block and it can be baited like one.

Edit: since the attack doesn’t start until 200ms into the dodge you would still have to time attacks well. The superior block would start 200 ms after a dodge."

1. It's to ensure their local movies have an audience. People want to watch movies and majority of the choices are their own movies, where the Chinese government are likely able to control the messenging and stuff.

2. Another important fact is censorship. They have a limit of 30 or so movies a year? So, if they don't like a movie, let's say Christopher Robin, they can just not show it and lump it in the excuse that it will not fit in the quota rather than it being blocked. Imagine, if China censors a movie, there are a lot of people in China that will just go find it on the internet. Streisand effect. But if it does not fit into the quota, maybe not as much.

This Chinese government is quite serious about shedding its corrupted image. I really do not think bribes are the reason here. "

- theres not a lot to do in denton in my opinion, we got some movie theaters, some bowling allies, and then bars and restaurants as far as the eye can see. So if those aren't your thing joking a club ir making some friends are your best bet.

"I've never heard of non-alcoholic liquors, but I get the concept as much as I get NA beer.  It's for people who like the taste of those drinks but don't want to get drunk.  Maybe they're recovering alcoholics and still like to kind of ""fit in"", or at least remember the taste (probably not a good idea for an alcoholic but better than actually drinking).  Or maybe they're going to a party/event but are the DD or just general responsible party member keeping track of their friends and just wanna drink their favorite mixed drinks all night without getting drunk.  Lots of mixed drinks are pretty good without having anything to do with the fact that you're getting hammered while putting them down."

"I had no idea adversion therapy could work with pedophilia. I did a small report on paraphilia's in college, and was struck by, not only the unusual interest in prepubescent children with pedophiles, but their uncontrollable urges, which is unusual in itself - most of us can control urges when confronted with even extreme attractiveness (e.g. Morena Baccarin for male hetero reference), but some of these people can not resist indulging their observations (perhaps lack of fulfillment is a factor).

&gt;  
&gt;Excerpt from the protocol number of the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist party (Bolsheviks) “Regarding Measures to Prevent Failure to Sow in Ukraine, March 16th, 1932.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Political Bureau believes that shortage of seed grain in Ukraine is many times worse than what was described in comrade Kosior’s telegram; therefore, the Political Bureau recommends the Central Committee of the Communist party of Ukraine to take all measures within its reach to prevent the threat of failing to sow \[field crops\] in Ukraine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Signed: Secretary of the Central Committee – J. STALIN

\---

&gt;Letter to Joseph Stalin from Stanislaw Kosior, 1st secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine regarding the course and the perspectives of the sowing campaign in Ukraine, April 26th, 1932.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are also isolated cases of starvation, and even whole villages \[starving\]; however, this is only the result of bungling on the local level, deviations \[from the party line\], especially in regard of kolkhozes. All rumours about “famine” in Ukraine must be unconditionally rejected. The crucial help that was provided for Ukraine will give us the opportunity to eradicate all such outbreaks \[of starvation\].

\---

&gt;Letter from Joseph Stalin to Stanislaw Kosior, 1st secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, April 26th, 1932.  
&gt;  
&gt;Comrade Kosior!  
&gt;  
&gt;You must read attached summaries. Judging by this information, it looks like the Soviet authority has ceased to exist in some areas of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Can this be true? Is the situation invillages in Ukraine this bad? Where are the operatives of the OGPU \[Joint Main Political Directorate\], what are they doing?  
&gt;  
&gt;Could you verify this information and inform the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist party about taken measures.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely, J. Stalin"

Shephard- Bouncyball shotgun. Uses whole clip every shot, but it shoots a shower of explosive bouncy balls. Only one tick of damager per second to any target, so dont expect to oneshot people, but its great at weakening large groups or clearing tight halls.

Hatchet- Fires 5(or so) energy donuts at extremely close range. Does tons of damage, but the gun fires in what is basically melee range. Kinda sucks, would not suggest, since your already in melee range when the gun becomes effective, might as well punch someone.

DPY-2M- Best gun IMO. Has medium range(fires just about as far as Kuzmann lightning) and does decent damage. Kinda slow fire rate, and bullet travel time means leading targets. It has Bounty Hunter for more gold, which is always nice. Secondary fire mode just kinda...drops explosive gumballs out of the gun. No real momentum, but its nice to clear a cluster right in front of you, since it has next to no range."

"Ill happily address these points, seen as though you raised them.

I’m only losing karma in doing this but if you want me to acknowledge your points, I will acknowledge they exist and address them in the most logical, non-ideological way because although I support Trump/vote Brexit (am from the UK), my opinions and what I believe to be true and factual are not things that are shaped by a circlejerk, I simply do not believe in ideology at all... and especially on a website that has a very left wing bias due to the fact that websites like The Guardian make a lot of ad money from reddit.

1. Black people need to be careful around cops because they’re shot? Don’t black people in ghettos commit the most gun crime? That being a reason for why they get shot by police more than white ppl makes sense, no? If the police are looking for armed murderers white or black - they’re more likely to be ‘trigger happy’, considering the guy is an armed murderer and they want to protect their own lives.

2. Blacks weren’t enslaved- some of their ancestors were. Just as every population has ancestors that probably were enslaved. I’m an Englishman - the Romans enslaved us. I have never been a slave, personally. Neither have black ppl in America. 

3. Denied bank loans? On skin colour? Or do ppl in ghetto/poorer areas usually have worse credit ratings? Is there more to that?

4. I agree black lives matter TOO as well as ALL LIVES. This victimhood mentality BLM pushes towards black people seperates them by making them think as if white America hates them. That’s partly the reason Neuro wearing that shirt is so fucking stupid.

5. The tariffs Trump put on the EU for example are FAIR. You can expand on this if you want but as far as I’m aware, the EU taxes American Steel as an import, (which means steel factories in the US get less international demand so have less jobs) when EU imports into the US weren’t taxed?  (so EU factories could import steel to the US so that US businesses buy it cheaper than US steel - which created jobs/demand in EU factories). Trump changing this brought jobs back to the US and weren’t those jobs in.... WORKING CLASS/BLACK AREAS????

I’m more than happy to debate how BLM is stupid &amp; creates divisions in the US/Trump/Brexit, any of this.

As an aside and something I’d like to add - being conservative or right wing on issues as a public figure is harder to do than being a left wing public figure, such as a white guy with long hair wearing a BLM shirt. If you also notice how Neuro plays on Avilos level/MMR and loses games to him, yet gets more support than Avilo online... its easy to see how not using your brain and going along with a narrative ‘everyone likes’ &amp; is actively pushed on the internet because Twitch/reddit purge differing opinions, then maybe you’ll understand why people buy into it without questioning it.

In no way am I hateful or am I small minded enough to judge anyone by the colour of their skin, because racists are also stupid ppl buying into other ppls ideologies. "

He would bash at the front door until it popped open, then stare at the opening like it was incomprehensible. Door would slam shut and he'd go right back to banging on it to get out. Never did go out unless we opened the door.

If you threw food to him, even food he was begging for, it would hit him between the eyes while he watched it in the entire way, never moving to eat it. After it hit the floor, he'd bark at it for 5-10 seconds, then eat it in one gulp.

Now wife was afraid of dogs. She'd just hold a hockey stick and he'd stay 10 feet away. Nobody had ever hit him with a stick. She didn't even have to wave it or point it at him. Just hold it upright.

"In principle the lower interest rate encourages lenders to give out mortgages, and borrowers to take out mortgages."
"Compared to pre crit nerf, neither option is good for Xayah as they dont scale her E, provide no 'real' crit and dont play to her extended AA Caster style of play. But it is what we are given so the choice comes down to your playstyle.

Stormrazor- best early to mid game option for most players. Upfront dmg proc with auto crit pairs well with second item RFC and follow on speed buff helps in all-ins. You lack CDR and mana early with this incentivising taking mana flow band over celerity which sucks a bit (and disencentivises you from using any other tree than sorcery for you crazy domination lovers and stopwatch users).

ER- Awkward early to mid game but turns you into a terror later. If you are spam happy with Qs and Ws to push lanes than the CDR and mana are nice to have. The CDR cannot be emphasized enough here. Xayah lost a lot of power when her abilities were indirectly nerfed (loss of 30%CDR ER as primary item and no easy way to max crit for E bonus). So bucking the trend and getting that ER anyways atleast gives you back some of her old power. People forget that with 40% CDR yoi can get multiple Es off in a fight providing not only damage but utility. This is without considering the ult passive. (Also in most team fights people wont respect five or six feathers but damn sure will actively avoid lining up for 9 or 10). 

ERs biggest liability is that it forces you to use your ult offensively to get the most from it. Not good vs heavy tank comps since youll want to save it for key spells. HOWEVER when vs a heavy dive comp or multiple assassins consider this, youll probably be using your ult at the start of fights a lot because their strat is to bumb rush you as an ADC. Same effect as using it offensively then.

Just food for thought. I cant say which is objectively the best"

My advice would be to start going to NA meetings, I ended up dropping 80% of my friends because they all are still involved in the party scene.

"And that's kinda the core of the problem people have though, that they aren't getting recognition early so they don't end up in her league, leading to that high level babe draw pool being shallow.

There are plenty of people in other fields like music and so on that are more than talented enough to perform on that level, so i would find it hard to believe acting would be substantially different. The biggest difference lies in the financial commitments studios and producers want to achieve, which would definitely feed a feedback loop.

As an example recently, Ed Skrein was cast in an Asian role in Hellboy (i think) and then pulled out when he realised his casting was excluding Asian actors. They then cast Daniel Dae Kim, who is an actor a lot of people recognise as quite talented. 

Plus the movie cynic in me thinks most of these roles that go to big names (specifically GitS) aren't exactly challenging roles, and they are in average films. Throwing the unrecognised a bone might help those films actually breakout by giving viewers something new to see and something to talk about. 

Another example of that is Sharlto Copley in District 9. Guy is fantastic, and that was basically his first big role. If that had been Tom Cruise the film would still have been good, but a unique portrayal i feel i adds to the value in a lot of cases. "

"The way torrents work is that if you have a block that is corrupted, but applied - download will never succeed. That is because final checksum will fail. You will also get slower downloads - as other clients will mark you as seeding bad copy. Hard to say for sure if that is what you are experiencing. But it is easy enough to remove everything from the updates folder and restart downloads. You will get a clean copy. If everything works - it was just a fluke.

"Hey, thanks! We had a really low res split out of the camera (only live, no playback) and on the split we could 50% opacity and flash between different saved images over the top of what we we shooting. So before filming we had the band go through each position and took a still on the monitor to later overlay.  We also had another frame used for horizon line and their shoulders had to sit a certain distance from the horizon. On top of that we had a measuring tape and a few lazers that detect distance.  

We didn't shoot wide and crop in, a few shots we scaled a little but mostly it's a true representative of what we shot. 

The biggest trick we discovered was whilst editing and that was to cut 1-3 frames before they reached the next position. "

"During the french revolution, the National Assembly was replaced in 1791 by a Legislative Assembly comprising entirely new members, the divisions continued. ""Innovators"" sat on the left, ""moderates"" gathered in the centre, while the ""conscientious defenders of the constitution"" found themselves sitting on the right, where the defenders of the Ancien Régime had previously gathered. 

The right wing often believes in nationalism,Capitalism.... The leftist was composed of Unified Socialists, Republican Socialists and Socialist Radicals, while the parties that were called ""Left"" now sat on the right side. The use of the words Left and Right spread from France to other countries and came to be applied to a large number of political parties worldwide, which often differed in their political beliefs. There was asymmetry in the use of the terms Left and Right by the opposing sides. The Right mostly denied that the left–right spectrum was meaningful because they saw it as artificial and damaging to unity. However, the Left, seeking to change society, promoted the distinction. As Alain observed in 1931: ""When people ask me if the division between parties of the Right and parties of the Left, men of the Right and men of the Left, still makes sense, the first thing that comes to mind is that the person asking the question is certainly not a man of the Left"". In British politics, the terms ""right"" and ""left"" came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the Spanish civil war."

To master it and reading music can take a while though. Bar chord specifically are what got me, i know a few and they sound fantastic when you play them well but can be tricky to learn and get your fingers in the right positions.

I feel that the artist may have bit off more than he can chew. Some of the tattoo is done pretty well, then others are a bit...chewed up and scratchy. Portraiture isn't something that all tattoo artists can do and this, unfortunately, is an example of that. I'm a bit worried of how his beard will heal along with the mouth and, honestly, the rest of his face.

So no, I don't think that you're being hyper critical at all.    
I wouldn't be able to say until I see it healed, but it may be possible for it to be fixed! I would recommend seeking an artist out that specializes in portraiture. It's one of those genres of tattoos that you -must- have skill in. "

"Guys (and girls), just to give my opinion a little bit. The revenue was slightly below what I expected ($1.70 billion), but the earnings report isn't bad. They achieved a 40% gross margin in the quarter and have guided for 41% in Q4 2018. It should come as no surprise that the graphics side of the business slowed a bit. Nvidia releasing the new series of cards and the crypto hype cooling down. AMD needs time to prepare a new disruptive graphics card release. At least the first part of the plan succeeded, increasing margins on the strength of Ryzen. The 30 percent drop is an overreaction. 7nm is still on track and will boost the stock price. Remember it's the first time in history that AMD has the process node and architecture advantage. If you are in cash at the moment, then choose a good moment to buy. If you still have the shares then hold, things will improve."

"In my opinion, not really. Nia's rings are these little chakrams, while Tira's ring is this huge ol' thing. I think giving the characters a moveset that suits them is a bit more important than necessarily having the same or similar weapon. For example, a lot of people who make a Link custom character give him Sophitia's moveset because she's the only* character who uses a sword and shield, but fail to consider that her rather dainty and girly animations don't exactly suit Link. I, personally, think it would be far better to give Link a sword moveset that lacks a shield, but has animations that look closer to how Link would actually fight.

Shove it in the jack and twist it around a bit then take it back out. Cotton stays together even when wet, so you shouldn't end up with stray bits in there. It should dry pretty quickly and isopropyl alcohol does not damage electronics.

"After reading many complaint posts, I can say that the main thing people said is weak synergy between cards. Gwent is about boosting and damaging but the way you do it is through archetype cards. That is not to say there aren't any synergy but it lacks solid synergies like in beta version. 

I think this is because CDPR wants to diverge from the old play style: decks contain only some important cards and the rest are for enabling. Now, as cards become less synergy with each other, other cards (like tech cards) can be included without the draw back of removing important cards.

I believe they are doing the right thing. In the future, expansions will introduce more synergies to the game and the possibility of multi-archetype decks."

Thankfully he backed up a bit and I saw my opportunity to leg it for the exit. He wasn't too nimble (he was withdrawing from alcohol and not in peak physical condition!) I was completely shaken but he just got a talking to by security before being allowed to stay (not my decision - I was at the bottom of the pecking order as a HCA). I did a full sweep of the ward to remove anything that looked like it could be used as a weapon but the next night, he attacked all three members of staff on the ward (throwing everything that wasn't fixed to the floor at us) and we had to shut ourselves in the nurses station. He got booted out of the hospital after that.

"Thirty here. I'm not sure I have it any more together than ten years ago, but I cope differently.   


**To-do lists and a calendar** save my ass EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY SINGLE DAY.     


And **ROUTINE**. 

&amp;#x200B;

I run a small farm, and work three part-time jobs, one of which is on-call and the other two self-paced from home.  This is extremely challenging, very independent, and not having a calendar or a routine results in me crying on the couch all day, feeling worthless.

&amp;#x200B;

Not knowing what any day is going to bring, I have to be up, breakfasted, dog walked, chickens fed, lunched packed, and dressed by  7:20 a.m.  If I don't get a call, I **already have lists prepared** for tasks I can do for any of the other jobs. If I feel I can't cope with any of them at that moment, we keep a list of farm objectives for each week/month.  Some tasks in my day are **non-negotiable**, for instance voting, or a doctor's appointment this week. Some are what I consider to be ""**least objectionable**,"" and if I'm having a rough day, I can start with something easy like watering the plants and cleaning the kitchen up before I get myself together enough to do the real work. Some other tasks are just goals for the week and can be moved to the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

A challenge not only for us, but the rest of the populace, is **tailoring a life that meets your needs**. I forget to put the chickens to bed frequently and then a raccoon gets in the door and eats my favourites? Make an automated door.  I forget my reusable shopping bags? When I empty them, they go right back in the car even if I have to put on my snow boots and slog through 2' of whitestuff.  City sounds bother you? Maybe you need to get out of the city. Paperwork of some sort due? I put it in my calendar a week ahead of the due date. I'm a terrible procrastinator (paying for expedited shipping on my mom's birthday gift that I've had ready for months and sent two days in advance...)

&amp;#x200B;

**Introspection**, as others have said, will help you find your own needs. Creativity will help you conquer them.  


I do, however, have trouble relaxing, not working, or deviating from my planned schedule for the day. Ask my boyfriend how frustrating this is. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Owe somebody something.** A planned meeting is far more likely to keep me accountable for myself than saying I'll swing by sometime."
"People in Brooklyn are terrified of dogs. I have tiny dogs but people will still cross the street to avoid them. Remember that until recently these neighborhoods were terrifying, and if you saw a dog, it wasn’t a playful, fun dog. It was a big scary dog whose owner had it for self-protection. So most people’s experience of dogs in the hood is sheer terror, not cuteness. Very different from the common experience of us young gentrifiers. (Yes I am one too).

Edit: People are saying you’re in the hood and so your BF is definitely right: sorta but not entirely. Bedstuy is nowhere near as dangerous as it used to be, especially in the western part. There’s a big difference between 9PM and 3AM in terms of safety. It’s not like you’re living in Brownsville or East Flatbush. Still, it’s worth being on your guard late at night. And you *will* get street harassment, even if it’s not violent. "

The fight against communism is the primary constant in most of our post WW2 interventionism in places like Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cuba, Iran, Nicaragua, etc.  Not showing up anybody.

And is untrue that we started the killing in Vietnam.  Vietnam was was involved in 6 wars spanning 43 years killing a total of 3.8M Vietnamese.  That was certainly not all on us.

And what we had to gain was making it painful enough for the Chinese, Soviets, and whoever, that they would stop trying to tyrannize millions of nations all over the world with communism.  But we screwed up in taking the fight to the South rather than the North, because we wanted to avoid fighting Chinese.  I think the Chinese should pay for their treachery.  If they are going to station troops in North Vietnam to help tyrannize the people (and kill Americans) then they should be killed.  They shouldn't have been there in the first place."

"Hey Phoenix! Thanks for replying! When you say you have trouble distinguishing the moving icons, do you mean you have trouble telling them apart (i.e., identifying a champion), or perhaps trouble telling which team they're on, or something else? Also, do you play with colorblind mode on or off, and do you know what your minimap scale is set to?

One, it preserves at least the sense that this is a living world that doesn't just revolve around the party, and if they delay too long they can be at the risk of people acting against them or carrying out a plot - basically saying for the future, hey, this is a possibility.

Two, the scene where the BBEG sarcastically thanks the heroes for helping make their goal come true is always a great one. (Sarcastic applause, offering them a chance to work together).

I'm thinking I might try to marry the two? Like, maybe they leave the room to see the BBEG with a bunch of his Bugbear thugs, and Nezznar orders his thugs to kill them and leaves, setting up both an ambush but preserving the final fight for later? That could be a nice hybrid. "

"In the same boat here pal. Looks like shes pregos. Weight gain is so hard to lose because each pound of fat is = 3200 cals. or so. Sitting is a 40 cal burn rate,insane biking is like 450 cals.. Crazy devotion is needed to lose that much weight. Diet alone won't do it for a long time which makes it so frustrating."
"Every time you request a minor boundary he cites that he won’t stop the friendship. And that’s so juvenile. Because he’s putting words into your mouth. You never asked him to end the friendship. You speak up when he and she cross boundaries into your time as a couple. 

The reason he does this overreaction is simple: If he can act like your reasonable requests are unreasonable, he maintains control and doesn’t feel accountable. It’s like telling a child “you can’t have candy right now you can have it after dinner” and the kid says “you NEVER let me do ANYTHING fun!” The logic is sort of the same. Act like the other person is trying to impact you more than they are so they shut up and let you do what you want. 

You’re the rebound after the divorce. It’s not that hard for him to navigate this; this isn’t actually a particularly long relationship. He is choosing to maintain a high level of contact, and what that translates to is emotional intimacy. 
And that’s fine for him. It’s not okay for you; and he is making is clear that additional boundaries aren’t something he’s willing to implement. So that’s your answer. And I think you should leave. 

And you’re not the only person who feels they are crossing these boundaries. The extended conversations during couple time, the immediate sharing of your moments with her. His intent doesn’t matter. That’s what he has to understand. It doesn’t matter if he doesn’t intend to leave you for her or cheat. What matters are your feelings and the basic boundaries of a monogamous relationship.

"When you hit post process in fusion to generate the code you can either do that on the setup or on the operation.

If so you would want to select one of those, post process, then select the other one and post process. The program will finish, you swap tools, make sure your tool height is ok, and then run the second program.

I haven't dug too deep into options in fusion but you should be able to have a single program that will pause the machine and allow you to change tools, like you describe. However, for your purposes just exporting 2 programs is probably easiest. "

"What more can you do? Name and shame.

Had a friend who's wife accepted a tenured position at a Southern University. Before he left, a refugee from that state challenged him. ""Whenever you hear them testing you to see if you'll tolerate racism, act like you're OK with it.""

In less than 6 months he was ready to come back. His wife didn't understand so he had her meet the neighbors, and his coworkers who thought he was fine with racism.

Then he pointed out that if they raised their son there, if he didn't learn racism, hell learn how to tolerate it. 

Not many people walk away from tenure,but they did. That taught me all I need to know about Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Even if the folks there aren't racist, it's not a deal breaker.

The only rational response is outrage and shaming, but you can't live there and do that. "

"While in principle you're correct that these companies are the largest contributors I feel like your suggested actions are reactionary, ineffective and irrational.

The real way to actually tackle the actions of corporations is through regulation and tax incentives/disincentives. A 'free market' will always push the boundaries of ethics beyond anything reasonable and it's the job of governments, regulators and legislation to affect change. 

The other side of the coin to regulation is in the united approach internationally. It's useless if Ireland, or even all of Europe have the best intentions and initiatives around tackling waste and climate control, but if other countries and continents aren't also involved, companies will skirt our rules by operating via their harmful methods in those jurisdictions if it's cheaper/more effective to achieving profit.

Do you have play doh, kinetic sand or something similar? I find that is less boring and keeps my kid’s attention for longer. I just take the little molds and make food or even just roll a bunch of play doh into balls and start handing them to her and she loves it. 

Do you have paint, stamps or crayons/markers? That’s less mind numbing too. I just give my kid a paper and some paint and let her go for it. With the stamps, I get non toxic washable ones and let her stamp herself and me. I can sit there doing something else and she will just have a blast giving me stamps. For the crayons, we had fun today coloring a random box I had. I also poked holes in it and let her see what fit in the holes (we had some of those poms poms that are a dollar at Walmart and she mostly used those.) 

I also put on music a lot. Sometimes kid music she asks for and sometimes my own music. She will often dance around on her own if I put something on. I’ve also discovered she has interesting tastes in music doing this, haha. 

Blocks or train tracks can be better too. Less pretending and more like “oh look, I made a tower, want to knock it down?” My kid will often make things and just want me to see what she’s made too instead of expecting a lot of pretend play.

Your pets won't drive you to the supermarket when you are old or look after you if you ever need surgery or become unwell.  They won't visit your house on weekends to check that you are OK.  At least children are a long term payoff.  There is no certainty any more that children will do these things but you can maximise the possibility by having a large family and being a decent person to them.  A pet is simply just dependent on you for a few years then it dies.  Children eventually grow up and become adults and hopefully contributing members of society.  They are the future generation who will continue to build civilisation.  How you can even compare the 2 is silly.  It's not about what you find 'cute'.  (I would actually argue that some babies are really ugly) Cuteness doesn't contribute anything to society and it doesn't build a future.

"Packing efficiency is certainly a good point, but the leaf degradation issues have nothing to do with the format. It's all in the chemistry. They picked a chemistry very susceptible to high degradation in elevated heat. The manganese of the cathode dissolves out into the electrolyte and across to the graphite anode where it catalyses negative reactions causing deg.

Leaf packs are also remarkably uniform in temperature. However, it's uniform at high temp due to lack of cooling, which accelerates the deg more.

LMO cells + no cooling = catastrophe. Though this wasn't well understood in 2008 when the decision was made.. Plus LMO is dirt cheap

Personally, if you’re looking for cost effective, I’d look for a used reliable car, if you’re looking for cheap power you can eventually daily, find you something with minimal rust, and slap that LS into it, and punch it chewie."

"My friend (who had very publicly held a flame for me for a long time) started dating a girl I was already skeptical of because I’d heard she had a history of dating multiple guys at once and lying to them all. She also looked like a heroin addict— and I don’t mean that exaggeratively. She literally looked like a nearly dead person walking around campus. She also just gave me the creeps. I couldn’t pinpoint it, but all my internal alarms went off around her. 

I heard many stories that sounded like she was  crazy person but it wasn’t until I ran into her at a party that I had a first hand experience. She shows up with my friend with a screen printed pieces of art under her arm. She corners me on the landing of the stairs to tell me made it for me. I look st it, say thank you, looking for any escape as being in that close proximity to her was very uncomfortable. She then squeezes my hands, plants a forceful kiss on my mouth, pulls away and runs her hand down my cheek and tells me she wants us to be best friends. Stunned and very near peeing my pants, I stare at her and a second later my friend comes up the stairs saying he had been looking for us. I laughed ran away and that night had a dream that she was demon who strangled me. "

"The fact that it produced such great fruit is generally an indicator that it feel it is dying. Instead of using energy to prop itself for the next seasons, a citrus tree will put all energy available into making the sugaryest fruit it can, as historically this presents it's best chance to pass on genetic material.

That all being said, you can keep the tree healthy while also convincing it to produce better fruit from drought stress. They key is regular (same amount of water given at the same time, Tuesdays at 4pm for example), infrequent (dont water every Tuesday at 4, just when the soil around it has fully dried up), and most importantly deep watering (you want to soak the entire area around the tree and down to its root tips). 

So my best advice is to work up a drip irrigation system that adds water slow enough to be able to penetrate deep without pooling on the surface, and then simply turn it on every 2 weeks or so, or whenever the soil goes from the saturated dark brown/black to the lighter moisture free beige/tan hue.

However, there are sales and customer service positions out there that need reliable native English speakers. I know the insurance company below hires a lot of foreigners and provides work permits.

"I am currently planning a wedding - if one of my closest friends got a random one-day stomach bug I would be devastated, and I would assume they were equally devastated and try to share as much of the ceremony/reception with them as I could afterwards. Pictures, videos, long chats to fill them in - if OPs friend can’t bear being there, and is willing to give up a super close friendship to avoid that pain, then I highly doubt he would be able to enthusiastically listen to his friend talk about the wedding or happily scroll through photos and videos. It would be so hard to fake enthusiasm while in lots of pain, and hard to keep your lack of enthusiasm from a close friend who knows you well. I would be SO hurt if a friend said they were excited for my wedding, didn’t show up because of an “illness” day-of, and then seemed standoffish and disinterested when I tried to share things with them about the wedding. That’s so so much worse than being forced to face a difficult reality like this one in the week leading up to the wedding. There is no disappointment on the wedding day when he doesn’t show up, there are no moments of confusion or pain afterwards when he can’t summon excitement when she shows him pictures. And most importantly, there is no dishonesty. I find everything about this much kinder than the alternative. 

I also think is incredibly dramatic to assume this is going to “ruin her wedding” - it’s certainly distracting and upsetting and far from ideal timing. But this also proved how amazing her fiancé is, and at the end of the day she is still thrilled to be marrying him. Her now-broken relationship with her friend isn’t going to make her less thrilled on her wedding day. He would’ve been absent either way, at least now she has an honest reason why. "

"&gt; Ziemlich wahrscheinlich ist die Realität auf Reddit verzerrt, die meisten psychisch gesunden Menschen haben ein Sozial- und Berufsleben und müssen sich nicht ins Internet flüchten.

Eher würde ich behaupten, dass es für die Leute mit Angst- und Sozialstörungen im Internet viel leichter ist, sich mitzuteilen. Wenn du dir die Besucherzahlen von Reddit anschaust und das weltweite Ranking, dann können wir zumindest davon ausgehen, dass wir auf US-Reddit einen sehr durchschnittlichen Bevölkerungsschnitt finden, ggf. wird da an den Extremenden einiger Eigenschaften gut weggefiltert(Alter, Intelligenz, etc.), aber das dürfte es weitestgehend sein, denke ich.

Unter der Annahme, dass meine erste Behauptung wahr ist, wäre Reddit nur eine ungefiltertere Darstellung als IEL. Ich weiß jedenfalls von mir selbst, dass ich hier auf Reddit wesentlich freier über meine Diagnose spreche als IEL. Auch lesen mich hier viel mehr Leute, was das Ergebnis noch mehr verzieht - wenn ich das bei mir an der Uni während einer VL rausposaunen würde, dann würden das vielleicht 50-150 Leute hören, wenn ich das regelmäßiger über verschiedene Module hinweg mache, dann schaff ich vielleicht 250-300 verschiedene Leute zu erreichen - das schaff ich auf reddit ggf. schon mit einem einzigen Kommentar, wenn ich das strategisch mache erreiche ich mit 3-4 Kommentaren gut und gerne ein paar Tausend Menschen."

"You're absolutely correct that there is variation year to year AND that can change as we collect more data. I'll try to clear this up a bit. We publish both predicted reliability and historical. Say you're looking at a 2015 model year that has seemingly no differences from the previous 2-3 model years. The 2015 will likely stay more stable over time because we have data on reliability from multiple previous years and predict it will stay around the same. Once that model year has been released into the market we can collect actual survey data from consumers and will make adjustments - if needed. This changes drastically if there have been major updates to the model such as drivetrain or transmission etc. Some of those issues may pop up a few years later, but we still want to provide the most current information we have to consumers shopping for used cars.
Our latest data, released today, included 500k+ responses. I like to think that's a pretty good indicator of reliability ;-)

In it, he suggests using something the brat hates such as tickling as a punishment and not letting the brat put that punishment on the hard limits list. This advice is unacceptable. Any participant can always put anything on the hard limit list at any time for any reason or even no reason at all. You can choose not to play with someone who puts one of your mandatory things on their hard limit list, but you do not get to control the list at all. Remember people, the only reason any of this is consensual is the fact that all participants have willingly and affirmatively agreed to participate in the specific acts performed. Also just in general it’s a bad idea to let someone outside the relationship set mandatories inside the relationship. "

Instead, ask them to provide you with the step by step diagnostic steps they would perform if they did have access. You can perform the steps and report the results back to them. Any competent devops person will be able to provide you with this.

This process takes longer but is far wiser in terms of security.

And as always, make sure you have an up to date full backup of your website files and database before you start any diagnostics or repair work."

"I have a cousin who works for Amway. He 100% believes it will make him rich one day. Let me emphasize that point. He has been doing this for *years* and he has gotten no closer to the goal of making money. All he has succeeded in doing is pushing his family away. Our great grandmother died this past summer. He hated her, she hated him. He wasn’t going to go to the funeral, but did so to show off his new girlfriend (who actually seemed rather nice).

He went to his great grandmother’s funeral, whom he hated and who hated him, to show off his new girlfriend and to save face, pretending to be doing well with Amway.

Pretty much everyone in our family avoids him and doesn’t take him seriously. I’ve met him *maybe* twice, he lives in Minnesota I live in California, and he contacted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to join, using my fiancé as a tactic to try and convince me a second income would be good to help support us. He knows nothing about me or my fiancé. Like I said, I’ve met him maybe twice.

Essentially, because of Amway, he has burned all of his bridges, the whole family (especially extended family members) dislikes him and avoids him, and essentially Facebook stalks people for information that he can try and use to persuade (read: manipulate) them to join.

Does your girlfriend want to be like this? This is what will happen. 

If you have questions or want screenshots of the convo my cousin sent me, just let me know."

Are you tracking with OPKs and/or temping? Generally any test 12 days after ovulation is definitive, but there are always exceptions to the rule! Unless you are tracking and know exactly when you ovulated, there is no way to know if your period is late. The sidebar has great info about this! Basically, there are a lot of things that can delay ovulation, so even if you normally have a 28-day cycle it is totally possible to have a random, say, 40-day cycle! If you aren’t tracking, there is literally no way (besides going to the doctor for a blood test and/or ultrasound) to know what is happening.

"I didn't say that they can't job because of emotion. I also recognize that women are competent, and that they often bring in certain skills that men done, just like men often bring in skills that women don't. I was saying that women have a hard time putting reason above emotion, and in business, sometimes you need to put logic and facts above emotions. 

I'm saying that when there is a crunch, when I have a week to do 3 weeks worth of work, out of all the colleagues I know, there is only one woman that I would even consider involving.  If I have 3 months to do 3 weeks worth of work, sure, I'll pass it to the women, they can do the work just as well. 

If I'm working on a client where a women was involved or if she knows them, I often keep them out of it, whereas if it's a client where a male colleague was involved, I'm more likely to work with him. I have to do a risk analysis either way, but based on my experience in my field, women are more likely to show bias then men. 

Like I said, it isn't that they are incompetent, it's that they are more emotional than men because our society allows them to be. I've seen men get fired on the spot for crying due to stress, they didn't have the support from the labour board that women have. That is the world that men live in. Since women don't live in that same world, they are a higher risk and often end up being harder to work with (due to their emotions) then men while producing very similar output.  "

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"Worked at a small amusement park when I was eighteen. A short list of what would happen. 

* Would get yelled/screamed at on a daily basis by both customers and other employees, ranging from complaining about how expensive the park was to being called a ""fucking idiot"" for not knowing something I wasn't trained on. 
* Got placed at an ice cream stand with a 16 year old pregnant high school drop out who would berate me and verbally abuse me every hour, at least. When I complained to my supervisor, they just shrugged their shoulders and said she was difficult to work with (from what other employees said), but couldn't do anything about it. 
* Got switched to rides, where you get to sit out in 90+ degree weather while again, getting screamed at by parents for not running the ride long enough, or not allowing them to stay for another cycle without waiting in line. 
* Got to see children being carried out on stretchers for head injuries, bloody noses and bruises from being jostled around on rides. 
* Operating rides alone that should be operated by two people. When brought to the supervisors attention, they just shrugged and said it wasn't their problem. 
* Worked at another concession stand. I would put up the order tag (like at a fast food place), and the cook would refuse to make my orders. When I confronted him and asked why my food wasn't coming out, he glared at me and ignored me. 

All of this for minimum wage, and one shitty employee meal (fried food). I no-showed and got a call from my supervisor, begging me to come back because they were short handed. Never responded. Have no idea how this place stays in business, considering I reported them to OSHA.

"So the US has a large cultural influence from Britain.. England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, etc.


There was a group of people.. historians, writers of chronicles, plays, eulogies and satires, called bards.


I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but one of the features of being a bard was supposedly immunity from retribution or revenge.. leaders were forbidden from killing these bards even if they said something unflattering about the leaders.



While this isn't the same as the modern journalist these instincts remain.. that a journalist should be able to go anywhere, talk to anyone, publish anything so long as it is true (or at the least entertaining).



That's part of why our libel and slander laws are structured the way we are, and the First Amendment is held very closely.



So even if the journalist is outside of the US, in a place which does not hold to the same ideals and laws, we expect them to be treated favorably, as those who 'speak truth to power'.


The other members of the media enforce this.. so when a journalist is 'disappeared', the word spreads."

"&gt;On the reverse side, MapleStory 2 has us doing dungeons. Sitting in Tria waiting for that one epic that has secondary stats that looks better on toilet paper than it does on a weapon or armor.

This almost reminds me of the current state of Diablo 3. In fact, now that I look at it, MS2 is a pretty-faced Diablo 3 but with Dungeon Limits. Get to max level and then run dungeons to replace your gear with better gear. The only difference is that Diablo 3 has no limits on the amount of dungeons you run.

I digress; to add to your thread - I think it sounds like a great suggestion. I feel Nexon will slowly implement more uses for PVE monsters and probably bring back grinding monsters for EXP similar to MS1. Right now, it is extremely inefficient to kill monsters for EXP unless they're World Bosses. MSQ is by far the best method following by Auto-Performing Music.

I would like Nexon to increase the incentive to hunt monsters whether it be your box suggestion or simply increasing the EXP you gain from killing said monsters."

So it’s not like your penis itself shrinks, rather that it is hypothesized that the tissue undergoes slight change that could potentially - but had not been proven to -relate to ED.

"He most certainly gives the ball away frequently, I think it really sticks out too because he will often do it with no pressure on himself. Did you watch the game on Monday? When he had nobody on him on the top of our box, hit a pass that was intercepted 5 yards from him with no arsenal player around, runs over and gives away a free kick on the top of our box without even attempting to win the ball back. It is not unusual for this to happen several times a match. It's different if Iwobi or Özil give the ball away in the other half of the pitch playing a lower percentage ball to create something. When you're playing as a deep midfielder you're expected to have a cool head to make the smart decisions and keep possession of the ball. Contrast Xhaka's passing with someone like Busquets. He may not have the passing range of Xhaka, but he's also not going to give the ball away needlessly in dangerous positions. Unrealistic obviously, but hypothetically I can't even imagine how much he would lift our game."

Definently.
"&gt;No one has a lesser say. 

They literally do though. Those in less populous state's have more say on who is president than would happen proportionally. Your argument was that this system of skewing the vote in favour of a minority of the country is some kind of check or balance to prevent tyrrany of the majority when all it does is overrepresent a group of people in selecting president. A system which does this without any other checks and balances would be open to a tyrrany of the minority. This can be seen in that the electoral college can in theory be won with ~1/4 of the popular vote.  The actual prevention of tyrrany of the majority cannot be handing the same powers to a numerical minority. It has to be covered by other regulations and legal rights in the electoral system and these could be maintained in a shift to a real popular vote.

&gt;. Our current system which you are against proves this as the number of times the majority has one has vastly outnumbered the times the majority as lost

Having a system where the loser wins just once is bad having it happen at least 5 times is worse (especially seeing as they can make Supreme court appointments which last for a while) this has also happened much more frequently of late with 2 of the previous 5 being won by the loser of the popular vote. 

&gt;Just like the civil war where all of the military loyal to the union didn't rebel right?

Yeah part of the military rebelled as well but the military is in theory under federal control. So assuming that the military doesn't rebel as well for whatever reason the federal government would have all the power here. The states have their national guard's though.

&gt;If Congress didn't immediately call it it would no doubt be escalated to the supreme court

As I said when I first mentioned indefinite delay. The supreme court is also a federal court and therefore it is the federal system which has the last say I've the interpretation of the law. The supreme court is part of the federal government and its members are selected entirely by votes in the federal government not states. Also it's 2/3 not 3/4 to call for a convention."

"Partly over lawsuits but mostly over PR. This kind of thing has been standard in reality/competition shows ever since an aspiring American Idol contestant lost her shit and committed suicide in front of Paula Abdul’s house back in the mid 2000s. In reality, this woman was just a severely mentally ill fan who had been stalking Paula for years beforehand. American Idol was probably not the cause for her suicide considering she already had a long history of suicide attempts and had been doing odd things outside Paula’s house long before she ever got onto the show. However the media reported it more like “American Idol pushes contestant to suicide” after reviewing her audition tape and seeing Simon make harsh critiques about her bad singing as well as her braces and appearance. It was a PR nightmare for everyone involved. Simon &amp; Paula both issued statements mourning her death and regretting how it all went down. The media blamed the judges for mocking her. The judges blamed the producers for allowing the woman onto the show despite Paula objecting to it and making them aware that this woman was a known stalker. The producers claimed they were innocent and that the judges made no such warnings. It was such a mess. 

And after that, there was a marked difference in how they handled the terrible auditions on the show. Producers now told the judges to minimize the brutality of their critiques and try not to laugh at the contestants or point out weight/appearance issues. “Crazy” contestants were looked at more carefully and actually taken seriously. Mental health experts were added to the payroll to help analyze the contestants. Security was heightened to keep judges and other contestants safe from any violent reactions from the rejects. At the time Idol was the number one program on television so their procedures were copied heavily by the other up &amp; coming competition shows. All the networks seemed to take note when AI made this major switch from looking at the “looney” contestants as comedic fodder to looking at them as actual potential risks for violence, mental breakdowns, and even suicide. For PR reasons primarily, these preventative measures became the standard for network competition programs. "

"I'm sorry you're going through this.  Would it help with expenses if you had a roommate? 

I remember being broke as a 2nd year teacher. I was only making $16,000. This was back in the early 80's. My car had a flat and I had to get a new tire ... and all of the sudden I didn't have money for groceries and it was two weeks until my next paycheck. 

Although I could have turned to my father for help, he was a U.S. military doctor and was on TDY (tour of duty) to Pakistan and I had no way of getting in touch with him. Keep in mind that back in '83 we didn't have the internet or cell phones. 

A teacher friend loaned me $50 just to make it through to the next paycheck. 

It was tough going. 

To avoid ever having to go through this again, I wound up taking two part time jobs. I drove a school bus before and after school. I also taught adult community ed.

During the summer I even worked campus security for a local  university. 

The hours were exhausting. I did this for two years and then wound up taking a job at an international American school overseas that paid twice what I was making even allowing for my two part time jobs. The opportunity to travel and see the world while just working as a teacher without having to work any part time jobs was a huge blessing.

In terms of your situation, have you considered being a server? I teach Culinary Arts and have several years of restaurant experience. If you have a nice personality and can multitask, you can actually make some pretty good money as a part time server even if you only worked Friday and maybe Saturday nights.

In this case, OP is in charge of the equipment which is on loan to the CPL. Even though the CPL outranks him, when it comes to matters regarding to the equipment, OP will have more say than him especially if he deems that the orders are damaging to the equipment.

Now, can he still be reported and reprimanded, yes. However, this will also open the question as to what the CPL was doing wrong which is not something you want. And given OP was doing his job in ensuring the equipment safety, he will likely be given a mild talking to at best while the CPL could be given a much harsher punishment for potentially damaging equipment.

"I don't think most gay people build their personalities around it at all.

But when you look for gay people, you find the places where being gay _is_ the focus. Gay people have complicated personalities, just like everyone else, but when the discussion is about gay people, that's the part of them that is most visible, so it often seems like there's not much else.

For a good comparison, look at sports fans. If you go to a football stadium and strike up a conversation with someone, chances are it will be all about football. If you go to a sports subreddit, you'll be hard pressed to find conversations about other things.

And just like there are (probably) people who only wear shorts featuring their favorite team, there are people who only wear rainbow shirts.

The ""adding more unique labels"" idea is a whole different discussion, and I don't want to go into much depth, but I'll give a brief overview of why I think we have the labels.

Yes, it would be ideal if everyone could do what they wanted (except hurt other people, I guess), but many people don't accept that.

The labels then serve two purposes. First, it's much easier to talk about things that have names, and, second, it gives names to Feelings some people didn't know they were allowed to have. I've heard stories of people's relief when they learned that there was a word for their feelings, because it means that they aren't alone.

In the end, the LGBT ""agenda"" is to achieve universal acceptance and equality: _everyone_ should be allowed to love whoever they want and be whoever they want (as long as they aren't hurting anyone else). So until we reach the point when everyone can accept everyone else, the labels are helping us get there."

You can't just change file name extensions like that to my knowledge. I am running sega cd games in CHD including Snatcher and it works fine with sound. You should just use the chdman program. In KMFDManic cores under xtras/tools he has the program with a batch file that you copy to the extracted game directory and it converts the bin+cue or iso etc. to CHD that run fine with Genesis Plus Gx core.

"Age difference is not normally an issue when the parties are older as a 3 years difference is nothing when you're in your thirties. But when you're still in your teens, a few year represents a huge difference in maturity and life experience. At 17/18 they're either still in high school or just left. Compare this to a person in their twenties whose either been in college for a few years, or the work place.

For me, it's a red flag that someone is dating someone a few years younger when they're in their twenties. It either shows that they're not maturing or their taking advantage of people who have less experience and are more likely to stay in shit relationships due to naivety. "

[Here is an article about this incident from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/us/chicago-bait-truck.html).

&gt;“Operation Trailer Trap” was led by Norfolk Southern Railway, with officers from its own police unit [...] after several thefts of parked and locked freight trucks and containers in the immediate area. [...]

&gt;The Chicago police referred questions to Norfolk Southern, which said the action was in response to cargo thefts that had included guns and ammunition. [...]

&gt;[R]ailroad officials said [...] the men who were arrested were between the ages of 21 and 59.

&gt;“The suspects saw a parked, unmarked trailer and then proceeded to cut open the safety seal and broke into the back of the trailer and only then did they find retail shoes in unmarked brown boxes, previously secured and hidden inside,” said Susan Terpay, a spokeswoman for Norfolk Southern.

It was a [sting operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_operation). They happen a lot. This one was meant to catch criminals that were already known to be stealing guns and ammunition, among other things, from trucks in that immediate area. It was not meant to catch opportunistic shoe thieves, teenage or otherwise.

Also:

&gt;After the tactic was roundly criticized, the railroad company apologized and promised not to do it again. Prosecutors dropped burglary charges against the men.

That is not going to make that neighborhood a safer or better place to live.

"If you're outdoors, you should, at minimum, have knee pads and wrist guards, they're a lifesaver. If you get more aggressive or add speed, wear a helmet. You never know how you'll fall and helmets are a lifesaver.

I grew up rink skating, jam and shuffle, so I didn't have any issues getting back into that. What I hadn't done much was outdoor stuff, especially on quads (I used to rollerblade outdoors around my neighborhood as a kid), so getting into that was challenging, because I wasn't used to varying terrains, random small obstacles, and hills, haha.

What I did was I drove around town to scope out trails and googled paved trails to hit up so I could gradually get into the feeling of concrete and asphalt without too much to think about. I also hit up some skate parks, because they'll give you some experience with changing levels and concrete without too many other things to think about. Empty paved basketball courts or parking lots are great places to practice transitions and stopping, which you should have a decent knowledge of before hitting tougher stuff. 

It took me probably a good two months of going 3-4x/week to feel comfortable with outdoor stuff, especially transitions and toe stops, since I just didn't use those much on the rink. "

Now to my complaining, and I almost never complain about OTF, I love getting my butt kicked at the gym.  We have had way tougher workouts than today, IMO. This one just made me angry to be at. By the end of the floor I couldn’t do more burpees because my wrists literally gave out from under me. And the pop squats didn’t give me any time to try and get my wrists prepped for the next round, so that was poorly designed. They have a multitude of workout options to throw into the “restercise” portion so I don’t get why they just did another style of burpee. 

And I will always think that rolling burpees are worthless. My shoes, which are grippy on the floor and good for normal burpees, just slide right off the bench on these, and it’s a gamble if I’m gonna make it on the return jump without slipping. 

I might be alone in this, and I know people will disagree with me, but I’d just prefer a difficult class with a range of exercises, instead of just fatiguing my joints before the targeted muscles get tired. "

"Are you serious. PR held the Nazi's from power. Try as they might, their best ""legitimate"" election result was in July of 1932 when they received 37% of the vote. They tried to force an election for more power in November but only dropped to 33% of the vote. He had to literally set the Reichstag on fire and blame it on the communists and arrest their members and leaders to get...only 44% of the vote. And then he had to literally use force to arrest all remaining communist members and keep opponents from voting to take power.

If Germany had FPTP, Hitler would've gained power sooner and legitimately. PR delayed Hitler's rise to power and forced him to use completely illegal methods."

"I'm not sure where you're getting your definition from. I am basing mine from what I find in dictionaries. Google says:

&gt; * the spreading of the Christian gospel by public preaching or personal witness.
* zealous advocacy of a cause.

[Merriam-webster says:](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evangelism)

&gt; 1 : the winning or revival of personal commitments to Christ  
&gt; 2 : militant or crusading zeal

[The Oxford dictionary agrees.](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/evangelism)

Neither of those apply to what Anthony does or what SE is about. 

&gt; Evangelism is simply trying to spread your religious beliefs.

Could you please source this? 

For the record, your entire assumption about my thought process is incorrect. I'm basing this argument off of the definitions I can find for evangelism, hence my confusion and apparent stubbornness to move from the point ""atheist evangelism."""

"I'm curious ...

If this weren't you having this experience, if it were your 13-year-old son, what would your advice be?

I do post a lot here, but I wouldn't normally respond to this. You've been blindsided with a haymaker and your world is suffering an earthquake of cataclysmic proportions. But you said something about disappearing, and I might not get an opportunity to make this observation again.

There are a couple of images from the Bible that are appropriate (hey, it's literature).

One is of the man who built his house upon the sand. When the rains came and the floods came, everything he had was washed away.

The other is of the merchant who came across a pearl of great price, and who went and sold everything he owned in order to buy it.

Many people think that transitioning is about passing; it's not. Transitioning also isn't about become something you're not. Transitioning is about embracing who you already are, being true to yourself. The pearl here is your true self; the sand is the false truth of who you aren't.

A third story from the Bible suddenly occurs to me. I suffered from dysphoria all of my life, and it pretty much ruined it. I know this because, after I came out to myself, the central, focal problem of my life, which had hamstrung me and prevented me from realizing my potential, which I always thought was something else and which I had long ago given up trying to fix ... simply and silently went away on its own.

You say that your life is pretty awesome; but I'm guessing that you have experienced significant conflicts due to your being trans. You may not have seen the connection; you may still not see it. I didn't see it for awhile.

Jesus is talking to his disciples about what happens when a demon is cast out of someone. He says that it wanders in the Twilight Zone (my words) and then comes back, finds the person clean and well-ordered, and, if it can manage it, moves back in with six of his college buddies, making the person's life even worse than it was in the beginning.

If you really are transgender, there is no going back. Trying will only produce more pain. We are who we are, and real peace can only come from embracing our true selves. It is never selfish to be true to yourself; and someone who expects you to sacrifice being true to yourself for their convenience and happiness is not expressing love. There are many things that can nobly be sacrificed for another, up to and including your life; but who you are is not on that list.

In the final analysis, the issue isn't that you're ""trans."" The issue is that you're a woman. ""Trans"" is simply a modifier; it says something about where you've been; it really says nothing about who you are. We are women. Hating who we are is worse than pointless; it's self-destructive.

How is recognizing a country's capital as being their capital a bad thing? Not to mention presidents had promised to recognize it for decades before him. And you know that if he had come out and said ""yeah never mind, I'm not recognizing their capital"" the Democrats would scream antisemitism.

"Back when I started playing back in 0.12, only mod was Sandbox. It was hard to get places and do things. With each new update, they added little things that helped.

With Science and Career mode, the Devs wanted to give players that experience we once had when the game first came out. The hardness early on. I think Career you get that experience. It can be a little stressful managing money. I haven’t played much Career. I took big breaks in the game.

I played a lot of Science mode when it came out. I was playing the game a lot then. You get that experience too of challenge, with lack of parts. You have to go out in the universe and explore to get more parts, in a way guiding you.

I just came back to game like a few weeks ago, after two year break. I am in Sandbox mode, testing things out getting familiar with things again. Making sure my mods work good. Freedom to tinker. Test out rockets I get from Steam Workshop or KerbalX.

I usually play sandbox, it’s like my KSP simulator to train and learn things. Being a rocket man is serious business. When I’m ready to do some serious stuff, it’s Career mode. I skip Science mode and go all-in with Career.

Don’t feel guilty about Sandbox, it’s a good place to mess around and learn things. There can be a lot to learn sometimes. "

"""US citizenship gives people immunity in foreign countries.""

By your logic, a US citizen getting held by the UK police for drunk pissing on a police car would be grounds for diplomatic crisis.

Foreign countries are allowed to arrest Americans, but more importantly, they are allowed to arrest their own citizens. They are especially allowed to arrest their own citizens for breaking the law.

And you really really need to stop being so ignorant, here. Saudi Arabia is not like your town in Tennessee. In Saudi Arabia, it is incredibly illegal to speak out against the government. It's so illegal that people who help you speak out can get arrested as accomplices.

This is interesting, care to expand? Are you saying they've been playing both sides the entire time?

&gt;the governance model of Nakamoto Consensus was thwarted in order to allow Blocksteam-Core to takeover Bitcoin. 

Ahhh, I see. Yes. It does indeed appear that Nakamoto consensus was not robust enough to guard against concern trolling, digital code takeover and social media attacks, I agree. **However,** I view that not as a flaw in Nakamoto consensus necessarily, but just in the ignorance of the various communities about this tactic. That's one of the reasons I cross-posted the thread, the more people who are aware of this technique, the less effective it becomes.

&gt; Since Blockstream-Core didn't have any hashpower of their own they were never in any position to takeover Bitcoin.

Yes, I understand your original point more now.

&gt;I contend that the ""community"" has been misdirected by a false narrative to conceal the actual actor or actors that want to redefine Bitcoin to a shitcoin or shitcoins.

If this were true, that would be quite the game-changer. But it makes sense and would explain miner collusion. Its possible all parties involved were physically threatened. **Very insightful** comment, sir.

"&gt; I've already stated my opinion that you have no evidence for your ridiculous assertion that there's only one possible reason for someone cutting in line. I've said that quite a few times now, so what is causing your amnesia 

That is your opinion about my stance. You still have not actually taken a stance about the real issue at hand, even though that is clearly what I have asked you for multiple times. Sure, I could *assume* that just because you think my 'one reason' stance is wrong, means you think there are many reasons. But you have not stated your opinion about the issue. It's pretty simple actually. You are just confused and/or delusional, because you can not think critically, apparently. 

&gt; I've already stated my opinion that you have no evidence for your ridiculous assertion that there's only one possible reason for someone cutting in line. 

You are incredibly pompous and egotistical if you think you can discredit my assertion, just because you think it is ridiculous. You have provided no evidence that I am wrong. My opinion is right, until you can prove me wrong. If you want to change my mind, then the burden of evidence is on you. No matter how unrealistic you think my conclusion is, you have not even attempted to disprove it.

&gt; That's exactly what an addlepated drug addict would say. 

That's exactly what someone unable to think critically would say. In fact, all of your similar allegations are indicative of someone that can not actually hold a real, civilized conversation. Or, maybe, you are too mentally slow to even fully comprehend my thoughts of the issue. But just because you can not understand me, does not grant you the right to make derogatory remarks about my statements. A civilized person would have just asked me to clarify my statements. But you would rather criticize. 

&gt; You might as well say the tooth fairy must be real if no one is around to disagree with you. 

Do you understand how opinions work? I have my opinions, and in my world, my opinions are right until proven otherwise. You have your opinion. Again, if you want to change my mind, then you will have to convince me. 

&gt;Other people I showed this to agree with me.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm not surprised you have nothing better to do.

I'm sorry that I have friends, and you don't.

&amp;#x200B;

So you want some evidence, eh? Take your pick:

&gt; To cut in line is to attempt to privilege yourself above everyone else for no good reason. 

 [https://www.quora.com/Why-is-cutting-in-line-bad-and-uncivilized](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-cutting-in-line-bad-and-uncivilized)

&gt; Who is the person in front of me to autonomously determine arbitrarily that his or her time is more valuable than mine — especially when cutting in line 

[https://thegate.boardingarea.com/line-cutting-is-it-getting-worse/](https://thegate.boardingarea.com/line-cutting-is-it-getting-worse/)

&gt; line jumpers deserve some special treatment because 

[http://www.coastercritic.com/2011/11/line-cutters-should-be-arrested-2/](http://www.coastercritic.com/2011/11/line-cutters-should-be-arrested-2/)

&gt; while resisting purely self-interested behavior (\[eg.\] cutting in front of others) 

[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2568322](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2568322)

&amp;#x200B;

In all reality, *every* reason that people cut in line will ultimately boil down to them being selfish, and thinking they are more special than the people in line. I know you can not easily comprehend my statements so I will give you an example to help you understand: a person cutting in front of a line of people waiting for a bathroom, with their excuse being that they *have diarrhea,* still compresses down to them thinking their diarrhea, and the cleanliness of their underwear is somehow worse (ie, more special) than my diarrhea. But I waited in line, because I understand the social construct of 'lines.'"

"Well I believe you are talking specifically about the works of savory. As far as I have been able to tell based of works critical of his, none of his holistic grazing methods have been able to be replicated and no research has actually be able to attribute the regrowth of grasslands to his grazing management. 

Many rangeland scientists in the USA have been unable to find conclusive evidence that his grazing did anything and that the regrassing of certain areas can possibly be attributed to the natural cycles of grassland.

The next critic is this doesn’t reduce emissions from the cattle industry. Even if we switched all farms to the grazing method, it would reduce overall emissions by .5%.

"I'll echo the older Stanley suggestions.  I have several and I love them.   Fair warning though, there is a learning curve with hand planes, and learning how to tune and sharpen them is the first step.   Unless you are buying a new LV plane for several hundred dollars, nothing you buy from the store will be ready to rock out of the box, so go with the older Stanley's. The newer ones have cheaper castings, cheaper irons, and cheaper totes and knobs.   I've heard several people say a new iron is a good upgrade for an older Stanley.  I don't disagree, but I have had no issues using vintage irons. Maybe I don't know what I am missing.

Someone mentioned the #62 low angle jack, that is a great all around plane.  If I could have one plane that is what I would choose.   It's not my favorite to use, but it's very versatile."

"I agree with this myself. Very happy with a majority of newcomers...

They might be cult classics from some obscure titles 30 years ago, but who in today’s age has ANY idea who the fuck they are? Imagine using “PLAY AS MACHRIDER!!!” as a sales slogan to people who don’t follow smash religiously like redditors. Who would be convinced to buy it then? Nobody.

Yh I don’t really understand the love for Geno myself but he’s been wanted for years and I’m happy Lord sakurai is blessing his fans. Same with banjo. And Issac is similar to pit in that he’s from a cult franchise that’s mostly dead and his smash inclusion can revive his franchise. But the other two newcomers are... nobodies. Nobody I’ve asked knows who they are. Even my dad, who grew up with NES and sega Genesis near religiously."
"Fair enough, I got it from ""there's no way you could argue that ow is more mechanically intensive than cs"" which sounded much broader than just aiming, as well as the stuff about flashes, but that's definitely aiming related, so that's fine, my bad.

In any case, with Widow there is one shot potential, Widow's have small heads, and a number of factors can change vertical positioning, and you can't stop on a dime as in CS, which IMO gives OW a higher ceiling on pure aiming, on at least that particular fight. CS overall is more punishing if you can't aim though. Which game requires more ""skill"" overall, I've no idea."

"&gt; I don't understand why this concept is so difficult for you. If you say ""All animals are either mammals or fish."" and I don't have alternatives does that make your statement true? No. It's basic fucking logic.

It obviously isn't true if there are 3 or more options. But it is true if there actually are only two options.

&gt; Why are you so stuck on the carbon tax? You seem to have literally assumed it in everything.

Because that is what is being discussed.

&gt; It is because it does not just rely on faith.

If you believe private sector R&amp;D is just faith, then the same must be true for government. Government doesn't magically come up with good solutions just because you throw money at it.

&gt; If Disney does it then everyone must.

Every large corporation plans years or decades in advance. Many small ones do, also.

&gt; Guess what? There are still papers about cooling as they have been for a long time because some papers focus on specific variables in the climate equation and some things cool the planet. Also, not all published papers are gospel, plenty of junk gets published. I was hoping you would take some time and learn something instead of regurgitating talking points from the oil industry propaganda.

&gt; Let me summarize the science for you: We have known for a long time that CO2 is a major control knob for global temperature.

Of course it was known that CO2 had a warming influence. But, as the temperature had been declining for a 35 years, no one cared. That isn't propaganda. Temperature declined during between the early 1940s and the late 1970s. Government investment comes from politicians, not scientists. Maybe I should have been more clear when I said ""people"" before. No politician was talking about global warming in the 1970s. There was no way politicians were going to tax people to put money toward fighting some supposed global warming which may or may not happen when the temperature was going the other way and there were far more pressing concerns."
"You won't get upvoted because people like to circlejerk their hate boners for America rather than do some fucking research. Let me expand on your explanation a little. in 2001, the Taliban controlled Afghanistan. You are pretty much right on the money. One important point to note is how remote the tribal regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan are. They are essentially a really big grey area with no real central government control where it would be really easy to hide if, say, you were an international fugitive. It would be relatively easy to pay off the local governments to look the other way even if they did manage to find you.

Another thing to note is that the US gave the Taliban an ultimatum ([per Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban#U.S.-led_overthrow_of_Taliban_Government_and_further_battle_against_Taliban)):

""Tonight the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban"", which he said were ""not open to negotiation or discussion"":[159][160]

        1. Deliver to the U.S. all of the leaders of Al-Qaeda
        2. Release all foreign nationals that have been unjustly imprisoned
        3. Protect foreign journalists, diplomats, and aid workers
        4. Close immediately every terrorist training camp
        5. Hand over every terrorist and their supporters to appropriate authorities
        6. Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps for inspection

They refused, we went in, and overthrew their government. That part of the war was over very quickly in about 2 months. (7 Oct 2001 - early December 2001). The reason we have been there since then is that we couldn't leave without providing them a government to care for their people. You can't just invade a country and then leave without setting up a working government, that situation provides a lot of hardship and fosters resentment (post-WWI Germany anyone?). We made that mistake in Iraq pulling out too soon, and look where that  got us. ISIS."

"Well, so are you."
"It's important to examine the cultural context where people are growing up when deciding how ridiculous their individual beliefs are.

Anything seems reasonable when most people in your society agree that it is true. When your whole society acts like playing dice is dangerous, you're going to assume there's a good reason for it.

You'll probably even be able to come up with a good reason for it. I once read an account from a person whose strain of Judaism forbid games of chance, describing how she came to understand the teaching because of how games of chance effected her emotions. She decided that what she felt was an ""up and down roller coaster"" must have been harmful and damaged her peace of mind.

Of course, if she hadn't been taught that by her religion, she probably wouldn't have reached that conclusion. But since the idea was already in her mind that there was something dangerous about playing games of chance, she saw the effects those games had on her in a negative light and assigned it more power than another person probably would have.

It is of course true that some people will do *anything* simply to please their God. But most religions also teach that their God wants them to be happy, and so will assume that things which he forbids must be damaging to their health or happiness.

If you start out with that assumption that all God's rules are rules for happiness, you can end up really believing it until presented with compelling evidence otherwise.

I, for example, was raised in a religion where homosexuality was forbidden. I was taught (and really believed) that homosexual activity made people depressed and anxious, and since the gay people around me always seemed depressed and anxious, it seemed to be true. It wasn't until I saw firsthand that it was actually the condemnations of the religious people that was *causing* the depression and anxiety that I switched my view and started looking into empirical research on the matter.

Which was what I left the church I grew up in over, as a matter of fact. When I had proof that their rules were actually harming happiness instead of helping it, I knew they were wrong. But that only happened once I had been able to see some things that they didn't want me to see firsthand, and because I had access to scientific research they also did not want me to see.

If I hadn't grown up in a public school where I had close gay friends, or had teachers who encouraged me to look at scientific data about homosexuality, who knows what I'd have ended up thinking?

And that's another thing religious folks often experience: when they are growing up, their parents will try to stop them from being ""exposed"" to things they consider wrong. So they never really get to see if they are harmless.

My family tried to make me go to a Christian school because they didn't want me to be ""exposed"" to gay people, but I had figured out by then that they were basically hiding parts of the world form me, marched into the principal's office and told him I didn't want to be there.

Who knows who I would be today if things had gone differently."

"Dugin is actually interesting, I have read a ton of his work and it is actually not neo nazi stuff, have anything to do with race, or anything of that sort. Interesting read about geopolitics and he has some influence in the government, how much is not known.

This is one of the quotes from his books

&gt; Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".

Keep it purely as flavor, as it always has been. Maybe as a crafter you gain a small bonus if the crystals you use match your deity, or boosted Ward for gatherers.  Say, repurpose the rings of the Twelve if you have one one or glamour it, you accumulate reputation while doing things.

"I know Israel is divided. Netanjahu is labeled alt right and they are indeed alt-right, but unlike the left we do not demonize them for being Jew-nationalists.
You can agree or disagrree with them on that. Personaly I think it is too radical, because it is racism, but I understand that is their nature and they want a homeland just for themselves.
Nobody is surprised about it.
The Palestinians much rather the Arabs or muslims genocided and ethnicaly cleansed around 200 million christians and Jews in the region it is why it is 98% muslim.
The Jews won and so now they do the same.
That is the nature of tribalism.
They are not Christians, we always have to keep that in mind. It goes for virtualy every other nation too. Look at China or Japan. 

Fascism is socialism. Marx theory (which is wrong or half-true (which is far worse) on everything) predicted socialism would happen naturaly. It didn't so the fascists decided they would make it happen using force. For that time I do not even think people had evil intentions for being socialists. They just did not know any better.
The difference between the fascists, the national socialists and the bolshevists or communists was the latter wanted global socialism and the former had no interest in giving up their nations.
That was the divide. Fundamentaly and some differences on economics (private ownership and no pathological quest to make everyone equal that so brutaly murdered many millions). 

You can read the creator of fascism himself Mussolini. Or listen to speeches of Hitler. It is all about socialism. They sound like Bernie Sanders and their policies very clearly reflect it. Nobody disagrees with the facts.
But the left needed to distance themselves from it after the obvious horror of world war 2.
Fascism is socialist, the only question is wether it is left wing or right wing. Normaly socialism in today's understanding is left wing. But the alt-right too is socialist just as the fascists.
It is the horse shoe theorem. The far left and the far right are very similair. The only and major difference is what group is the ingroup.

Far left= global socialism
Far right= national socialism"

"I would ALSO love to know.. for local development purposes, how for example you deploy part of the app, like the DB and back end server, in containers, but then say you are building a web UI (I use ReactJS with NodeJS) locally to do rapid development.. how you typically set things up so that your non-containered UI dev stuff can access the server bits without CORS issues? I seem to always run into this, where the internal IPs dont match (or usually dont match) my machine IP.. or if I am developing on one machine, but have another machine running containers with different IP.. my UI always hits the CORS snag.

This sounds a little different than OP.. not trying to hijack thread.. in fact to the OP quedstion about using something like DNS, I am wondering if some sort of service discovery bit like zookeeper or something is used to find the IPs/ports of services (in my case a back end API service)... and if so, how you typically set up.. in my case.. a UI to do this?

I am also going to add.. my back end is a micro services deployment where by there are several containers (one for each api endpoint(s)) so I assume I need some sort of containerized nginx load balancer at the IP (discovered by UI??) to then handle distributing calls to the proper back end containers?

"You can use [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) which compiles the constant traceroutes it does so you don't have to spam traceroute in Command Prompt waiting for it to catch the issue if you are spiking in ping. Just enter the IP in the Hostname field and press Start. 5 minutes is usually good.

"Hola! No math here, but personal story of pulling.

I had these resources:

3 30% 5* Ticket  
8 10% 5* Ticket  
42 4*+ Ticket  
175 Regular Ticket  
1 10+1 Ticket  
3 5+1 Ticket  
1 4* EX Ticket  
4 3* EX Ticket  
37.5k Lapis  

I ended up getting one GLS, one Demon Rain, one Knight Delita, one VotD, one Rem, and one Balthier from all the tickets. Luckily, I already had one GLS from last year, but now my Demon Rain is lonely. With the 20K step-up banner, I got one Lilith and one Lucius. 

I have not used the Halloween tickets, yet.  

My sister on the other hand had a bit fewer tickets than me and did not do the step-up. She ended up getting three GLS and one Dracu Lasswell, along with some off-banner rainbows. As she too already had a GLS and a Demon Rain from last year, she’s very happy about her two 7* GLS right now, but sad she didn’t get another Demon Rain."

Between the Civil War and WW2 alcohol prohibition became a big thing. And while I don't drink and so it wouldn't effect me personally, the ideology behind it is revealing.

Same with immigration restrictions. Immigration restrictions started in the decades after the Civil War and were at their most severe in the 1930s.

Imperialism was also popular in the US in the late 1800s and early 1900s. 

That's also when the income tax was passed.

The idea that Americans support individual liberty is a myth. It has always been a myth. Some support liberty for everyone. Some support liberty for themselves. Most don't support it for anyone. They like the idea of a government that forces people to conform to their beliefs."

"Do we actually have any evidence that the strike was ordered with knowledge that the son was going to be killed? As far as I can recall from the Scahill documentary, he basically ran off on his own after his father was (accurately) targeted and killed, and was traveling with some locals who were the targets.

We've lit up Pakistani wedding parties, we've blown British and Canadian soldiers to bits, it doesn't seem all that far fetched to accept the official explanation that ""it was an accident but we're not sorry"". The ""not sorry"" part is cause for concern in its own right, but that's not the same as Obama personally ordering the assassination of a child because he had the wrong parents."

"Are you using your public IP to connect from outside of the network? 

There's a lot of ways to tell what it is:

Or a site like this to see if your port is open on your router.

The external port in your router config is the one you need to type after your public IP, the internal should match what you configured on tautulli.

Eg Public IP:9999 -&gt; internal ip:8081

They can be the same port if you want.

"About a year ago I sold my 1966 Chevelle that I thought I'd miss a lot (sentimental reasons).  Have thought about it three times, twice when I saw the guy I sold it to at the bar and once right now.  I didn't have the time or the money to fix it the way I wanted to and hated watching it collect dust and probably rusting.  Unless this is your ultimate dream car (1970 Chevelle SS 454 for me) then sell it if you can get a decent price."
"I can see how someone could support an artist who made an isolated mistake but man, this was a real malevolent dude. Someone who was cruel, manipulative, you listen to his music and you can hear it. Lots of people fooled by this guy. People say they can separate the art from the artist. If you can listen to this dude and still run around like ""I love XXX"" after hearing him talk so nonchalant about who he is, then I really can't fuck with you. Just like I can't fuck with Trump supporters. If someone can overlook who these guys are, something is wrong with that person and I don't want that person around me or my family. Shit has definitely changed in this world. "

"It counts a hell of a lot in MMA. Chael Sonnen made a career off of almost beating Anderson Silva. Stipe wasn't shit at heavyweight until he almost beat JDS. Claudia Gadelha was the only other strawweight people cared about for like 2 years because of the times she almost beat Joanna. People take notice when you are able to cut it close with fighters who are seen as the best of the best. It means you aren't far off of them, and therefore are far ahead of everyone else. "

"Hahahaha no you're right.

I forgot, we're only allowed to hate Christianity and European shit.

Carry on.

Muslims are totally innocent. Every crusade was simply a completely one sided war from the Christian end. Muslims never ever shed blood to spread their cult into Christendom.

The Muslims were only in Jerusalem and were valued and welcomed guests who were let in because they asked so nicely. 

Muslims were only banging at the gates of Vienna because they were invited for a dinner party.

Muslims only conquered Iberia with love and tolerance.

Islam went from being a tiny moon god cult in the middle of Arabia to spreading from Spain to the Phillipines because of their amazingly peaceful nature, simply convincing half the world to convert through their loving example.

LMFAO!

I can recognize how fucked Christian history is, especially in the European colonial eras.

I can also recognize how fucked Christians were in some of the Crusades. 

Can you do the same for Islam or are you intellectually bankrupt? "

"I can't really speak to the cross, but there's a bit of a difference between an artifact present in the legislature and the dress code of public servants. The crucifix in the national assembly could be considered a cultural, historical, or traditional artifact while modern day religious garb may not hold as much non-religious significance. 

While obviously this impacts Muslims and Sikhs most significantly, the proposal does not *exclusively* target these groups. As far as I am aware, Christian public servants are made to keep their religious attire(such as cross necklaces, etc) hidden as well. This is done to ensure that the face of the government(the public service) is not visibly religious.

I think that it's a reasonable proposal, honestly. "

"&gt; I have always heard that for someone young like me (28) Roth is the way to go, because I expect my retirement income to be higher than it is now

Your tax rate now is not determined by your age, but rather by your taxable income.  We commonly hear from 28 year olds who make  &lt;$10,000 or &gt;$200,000.

&gt; My first question is what exactly does retirement income mean

Your taxable income in retirement will be up to 85% of your social security benefits (unless the law changes, which is it is likely to), plus all withdrawals from traditional-type retirement account.  Plus any other taxable income you have like investment income, rental income, pensions, etc.

The optimal distribution between Roth and traditional is very hard to know, as it depends on future market performance, future tax law changes, future social security law changes, and your career trajectory, all of which are fundamentally uncertain.  The good news is that the differences are not large, so usually it doesn't much matter if you make exactly the optimal choice.  Using the ""wrong"" one is still much better than not saving at all, and probably also better than saving in a taxable account.

The main advantage of a Roth for many people is that it tricks you into saving more.  To save the same amount in traditional, you have to take the current tax savings you get from traditional and re-invest those as well, which most people don't do.  (Including you, I assume, since your rates of 13% Roth and 2% traditional add up to 15%, which is the usual savings advice but only if one ignores the current tax benefits)"

"Contact your attorney, or really, get a referral for an attorney specializing in elder law. Get the attorney to contact the assisted living home, and APS, and let them know what SIL’s plan is. Don’t do it yourself, let the attorney do it FOR you. That way, you are removed from the situation, and the attorney can make some nice, legal threats that aren’t actually threats, they are the promise of what will happen should SIL and MIL continue down the garden path of stupid.

Let your attorney handle them. When SIL pipes up that you OWE her for housing MIL, let your attorney remind this cunt that MIL OWES you tens of thousands of dollars for damages to your home, and let’s not get into the emotional damages that she caused ruining your home deliberately. 

I see them backing down quickly when you get an attorney involved who lets them know that SIL will be in the hook for elder abuse, neglect, and abandonment, and MIL will be on the hook financially as will SIL, should they be stupid enough to try it on."

I, for one, welcome any and all questions if law enforcement has it. I'm more than willing to cooperate. And that's not just cause I'm likely on a few lists, it's because they deserve my cooperation.

What works for my 3.5 year old is just telling her we will sit where we are in silence and do absolutely nothing until she does what I told her to do. Usually after a few minutes she will do it. This has been the only tactic that has worked for us. Since we have started doing this a few months ago most of the time she just does it when I ask without questioning it.

This doesn't seem to be true. A cursory look at some of the books tells me that this is not the case for several of the books. The books you chose to list were not random, right?

&gt; the issue here is the fact that the books in question are overtly political

Why? 

Because you were looking forward to the not-overtly-political content of a ""Get the Vote Out"" bundle on Humble Bundle, so it wasn't to your satisfaction? Because a company shouldn't be allowed to sell overtly political material?

Because it is the wrong type of overtly political content? Because you and other gamers should have a say on what others in gaming are or are not allowed to do? (""from a side that is openly hostile to gamers/nerds"")

People expect you to come and go, and while they clearly want to retain you if you do good work, they will be happy for your new opportunity because you provided so much benefit while you were there.

Just look at people who play with ""girls only,"" ""males only,"" etc. They all have different tastes, and things that keep them tied to the game and may not agree with everything about the game.

You want to tackle climate change? You need an absolute value, not a relative one. Don't come at me with obvious statistics per capita - of course per capita China produces less. Their rural population alone is 20x Canada's entire population (most of whom live in a residence with amenities much greater than those Chinese folk who may use technologies we used a century ago).

If by now you don't get it, here's a strawman: If we suddenly found out that one town in Bavaria had 30x the per capita rate of CO2 emissions as your average Canadian, if you completely shut down that town, it would have negligible effects on global rates. Tax those town members - sure. But don't pretend you're solving global emissions problem, you aren't. "

"I think Gallows is just a general mood setter for the entire album. It sets up every major theme with its lyrics about depression, self-loathing,  loneliness, and letting down the person you love most, and it also serves as a musical road map. It has the rousing feeling from songs like Date Night and Disappointing Diamonds, but it also has moments of quiet desperation that set you up for songs like The Palace and The Songwriter. FJM is basically hanging out at the gallows throughout the whole album, wondering if he'll actually do something truly irrevocable that can't be forgiven like his previous sins. Please Don't Die explores the same idea but from Emma's side of the story. 

Also, ""I'm treading water as I bleed to death"" just feels like the thesis statement to the album and really lets the listener know what they're getting into. "

"I actually really like this album.  I find the whole ""KISS softened up"" argument to be ludicrous, as if they sounded like Black Sabbath before.

""Heavier"" KISS (at least in-studio) is more of an outlier than softer KISS.  Have you guys even listened to the debut?  Great though it may be, heavy it is not.

As for the album, I think its very consistent.  ""Sure Know Something"" is perhaps my favorite KISS song, and ""Magic Touch"" is great too.  ""IWMFLY"" is undeniably catchy, and ""Dirty Living"" is easily the strongest song Peter had any hand in writing.  ""2,000 Man"" is superior to the Stones' original -- Ace nails it with the vocal delivery.

""Hard Times"" and ""Save Your Love"" suffer from some crap lyrics, but musically they're very solid. The same can be said for the Gene tracks.

He didn’t lose his roster spot because of cancer. He lost it because there are three better safeties on the team. I’d debate his impact on the team the past couple years.

"How do you figure? If you buy $500 million in tickets that's 250 million unique tickets. There are around 292 million possible combinations so there's around a 14% chance you don't win at all. There's also a chance that someone else wins and now your prize is divided by 2/3/4/etc. After taxes and the 25% cut for taking the lump sum (which is always the right move) you're left with around $756mm in winnings. With an 86% chance of winning that gives you an expected value of around $647mm assuming nobody else wins, so that number would actually be a bit lower (around $610mm).

You'd be risking $500mm for the chance to win $110mm and there's a good chance you lose it all. That's a terrible investment."

"I know some historical math facts. 

Galois, noted for the ""modern"" algebraic advancements to Field Theory was rejected from all the top universities he applied to. He submitted proofs of some really difficult math problems, and the heads at university thought they were all false proofs. Turns out they just weren't able to comprehend his new techniques. He died in his early 20's dueling someone. 

One of the members of the cult group, ""The Pythagoreans"" was murdered by his own members. Why? Because he proved the irrationality of square root of 2. (Allegedly murdered, they covered it up). 

Mathematicians used to challenge each other to ""math-off's"" to show who's the smartest. They would write down all of the hardest problems they know how to solve, and exchange papers. They had about 30 days to solve them. I forget all the rules, but there's something funny to me about two incredibly intelligent people challenging each other to a math-off. "

"&gt;But saying illegal imm1gration does not take jobs


First, I’d like to clarify that the prevailing sentiment is that ‘IMMIGRANTS are STEALING jobs’.  

So let’s break that down quickly, ‘immigrants’, doesn’t inherently mean only illegals, it implies every kind of immigrant. ‘Stealing’ implies that they are taking a jobs that already belonged to someone else...

With that being said:

&gt;is more complicated then what u say.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;it is about how much they pay, simple as that

...oh, so if pay is the limiting factor then why aren’t we punishing the ones who have control of how much they pay rather than painting this negative stigma on immigrants

"I've been exactly where you are.  When I was 165, I was thinking I was at about 23% bodyfat.  Instead of was measuring wrong, and turns out I'm between 27-30% bodyfat.  I threw up my hands and started eating at maintenance.

What had I been doing for 7-8 months?  Losing a lot of weight but still fat.  My goal was now farther and farther away, I want to be 20% bodyfat.

As soon as posted I knew you were about 40 pounds overweight.  Someone your height should ideally be between 115-125 lbs.

Your focus now needs to be on weight loss.  Lose the fat, it'll make working out easier.  Continue lifting, lifting heavy things while living, dieting, is always a good thing.  You'll build some muscle fast because newbie gains really are a thing.

But get your weight down to about 125, get your BF down to about 20%, then start lifting seriously so you can start bulking and building.  Protein is very important for building and maintaining your muscle mass, so make sure you're getting it.

I'm now back to eating at a deficit and working towards my goal.  I lift 3-4 days a week, push, push and a leg day where I now do squats with a bar.

You CAN do this.  Don't throw it away.  You can definitely do this, and it's all worth it.  Building muscle takes worth, but you can do this."

"I came home from a daytime hang with some friends to find my freshly minted ex-girlfriend (it had been about a week) sitting on the hood of my car. Driving up, my friends had pointed her out to me and were laughing at my misfortune before even parking the car. As we step out, she rushes me, practically pinning me to the car. She let’s into me yelling how betrayed and angry she felt, pretty normal breakup stuff really, but none of which came out during the actual breakup. I thought we had ended things on pretty amicable terms. This goes on until a friend of hers pulls up and asks if she was ready to go (the friend had apparently dropped my ex off there, ex-girlfriend didn’t drive). Ex says “No, he’ll bring me home” indicating me. At which point I do bring her back to her place and she insists I come up so we can continue our talk (I have hardly spoken, she has just being unloading on me). I decided to just let her get it all out so we can both move on. Fast forward 20 minutes to me trying to explain that things aren’t going to work out because of the smothering sort of behavior she has been exhibiting throughout this ordeal. At this point she relents and I start to wish her well and leave, but she says she’d feel so much better if we slept together one last time, specifically calling it “breakup sex”. I wish I could say I just walked out and that was the end of it, but I didn’t. 
Funnily enough this is where the real crazy kicks in...
The next morning I come home and one of my roommates is there in the living room, when he sees me he busts out laughing. First, it’s obvious I spent the night with my ex. Second, something happened before I came home to my ex sitting on my car. My roommate explains that before I got home, she showed up banging on the front door like it was some sort of emergency. He opens the door and she pushes past him growling “where is he” He said before he could stop her, she searched the entire house, going into our other roommates bedrooms, checking the closets, under the beds, going into the bathrooms and pulling back the curtains, looking for me. She then goes to the kitchen and checks the pantry and then finally under the fucking sink. She thought I was trying so hard to avoid her that I hid under the motherfucking sink!

You get two for the price of one here, I knew she was crazy when she thought I was hiding under my sink to avoid her and I knew I was crazy for sleeping with the lunatic!"

I had not even thought about Seconal until your mention. You brought back a long dormant memory. Thanks!!!  When I was a teenager a friend invited me over his house to go swimming because his parents were gone for the weekend.

Nothing eventful resulted other than us falling asleep soon after our swim but thanks for the memory. That could have had a very different ending.
"Guns appreciate, most guitars don't. You should view one as an investment, the other an expenditure.

Ammo for the most part is always a sunk cost however. Some ammo is up to a dollar per round, some even higher. You really have to factor this into the original purchase of whatever you plan to shoot.

A dollar a round isn't too bad if you only own the firearm for hunting. But for plinking/target practice it's super expensive. My plinking rifle runs around $175 per thousand rounds or 17.5 cpr which isn't terrible at all. "

"Nope! As a matter of fact, pretty much when any crime is committed and it gets into the public discussion (as is the case with celebrities, politicians, athletes, etc), half the media takes one side, or thinks one side is lying. It sucks, and it ain't right, but there are also many people that do go about it correctly and withhold judgement. Ya, even people in the media and in the press will hold back from condemning either side. As a matter of fact, most of the nightly news on regular main channels like NBC Nightly News (not cable news though; Fox News, CNN, etc are worthless) are pretty fair when it comes to covering this kinda stuff without taking sides."

"Physicist here. Given two objects with an identical cross section, drag works as a function of velocity. So, a slower moving object will be slowed less (per unit time) than a fast-moving object.

On the other hand, kinetic energy is proportional to both mass *and* velocity, while potential energy is proportional to height and mass. Potential energy is translated into kinetic energy as an object falls.

An easy way to make a heavier arrow with the same cross section would be to extend the length of the iron head, or include lead somewhere in the construction.

This is a long winded way of saying: no, it's unlikely that the extra material would substantially increase the drag forces on the arrow. It would only change the drag forces in that the missile itself would be traveling slower. "

It would be more than 20 hours of homework a night, and that's just not possible.

With this mindset, you can literally apply to 700 jobs and you won't get an interview. 

In this post and thread, you should be the one forcefully and proactively asserting what it is that you think matters in this world and what needs to be done. If you don't care about anything, a lot, then where can you expect to get money from? As a slave, or a cog, or a shyster?

"You know, when I was a young, foolish, idealistic kid I admired Abraham Lincoln *because* of rhetoric like this. Now I admire him in *spite* of it.

Lincoln didn't view the leaders of the Confederacy as his enemies, and look what that got him. It got him, personally, assassinated. Historically, it means that 150 years later, even well-educated people in the South believe that he was assassinated because ""*sic temper tyrannis*,"" and that it was just punishment for the ""War of Northern Aggression.""

It got us all a metastasized Confederacy across the country, and it got us Jim Crow, and a failed Reconstruction. It means that symbols of hate can get sold to white people as ""heritage,"" even while they send their intended message of ""you are subhuman"" to black people across the south. But these symbols are popular, in part due to the argument that we need to listen to ""the better angels of our nature"" like the ""Great Emancipator"" himself said.

Continue believing this, I suppose. If you are white, it won't cost you much. And if it means a crueler, more fascist country, you seem willing to allow the minorities within it to pay that price for you.

We need to start calling traitors, traitors. Lincoln was *wrong* about this."

"At the OC4 keynote (minute 14), and I think elsewhere, Carmack has said that mobile SoC will probably never have the raw computational power of today's (today being last year's) PCs. Computer chips have been getting faster for as long as I have been alive because the size of transistors keep shrinking, but there is a minimum theoretical size that a transistor can be (they can't be smaller than an atom for example) and we are approaching the minimum theoretical size. Atom's are .1 to .5 nm large. The current cutting edge for transistors is 7 or 10 nm depending on whose marketing you believe. Hard as it is to believe at some point in our lifetimes computers are going to more or less stop getting faster. Carmack thinks we will get 1 to 2 more order of magnitude improvements in mobile chips (as of last year) and that's it. He does not think this will be enough to have the same raw computational power as last year's PCs. Mobile SoC are limited by power budget, thermal management, and size issues that PCs aren't.

Do note that this is raw computational performance or even more specifically the transistor budget chip designers have to play with. If we get things like eye tracked foveated rendering on mobile, then the mobile gpus don't actually have to be as powerful as today's PC's gpus to deliver an equivalent experience to today's PCs."

"Of course sexual attraction is important but...

When it comes down to it, you choose your partner to be your family. Ideally for life.

How important is it that your family member is sexy? Do they have to remain sexy into their 80s and 90s? At what point in the aging process are you like, okay, we're old, nobody's winning sexy contests anymore and that's cool.

Do you abandon your kids because they are ugly? Disown your mother because she aged poorly? Never visit grandpa in the nursing home because he has unsightly liver spots? 

I think it is baffling on some level that we choose our lifelong partners with such an emphasis on their attractiveness and not because they are a good long term partner for us. 

Now, I know (or hope) you're not out there fucking your kids, your aunt, or your cousin, and that attractiveness equates to what you assume to be healthy offspring, but I feel like our values are kind of fucked on this subject."

Have you tried vaping (18 mg of nicotine level)? DH does that and he hasn’t touched cigarettes in two months. He’s 31 and started smoking at 16 so you can imagine how hard it has been for him. Also some CBD vape oils or any CBD helps calm your mind from the addiction and withdrawals that you will get. That has helped him though this. I on the other hand have no problem starting and stopping cigarettes so I didn’t need all that to stop once we had kids but that’s what works for him. Hope you find some help with this and get a hobby lol

"I got pulled out of public school after 2nd grade cuz they really didn't know how to handle me.


Went to a private school from 3rd grade till graduation. This place only had about 30 kids in the whole school and 3 teachers, so pretty much everyone knew everyone. As a result bullying was close to nonexistent, and anxiety of being in large unknown crowds was basically gone. Went from an average student to a 4.0 GPA.


At around 13, started taking a Social Skills Group. It was full of other aspy's, and centered around positivity and self confidence. It stessed that we are not abnormal, because since everyone is different-there is no normal. Activities focuses on teamwork and stretching our comfort zones, and knowing ourselves. If we knew ourselves, we could work on focusing on our positives, and working to improve on our negitives. Graduated at 18.


Went to both a therapist and phyciatrist for most of my life, ones that are thorough rather than all business. I have been on Prescriptions most of my life, and quite a lot of them.


Today, I am 19 years old in my 3rd semester at college. I have a part time job on campus, and have been interacting with my classmates and co workers (though I still can never approach people myself, I wait for them to talk to me first-which is good cuz I tend to stand out. I prefer it that way.), made the deans list, and got accepted into the PTK Honor Society, I have been weaned off of almost all of my medications, and overall I haven't been much happier my whole life.

"This is helpful. I'm not sure how much of an impact it will make until I let myself ruminate over it for a few days (at least), but this kind of information is what I'm really looking for. I have a BA in Psychology (the irony is not lost on me) so I've done a ton of research on peer-reviewed articles about OCD and CBT, but that angle just isn't helping me beat this down. I see things logically, so if I see someone cough into their hands and then hand me paperwork, there's no way (at least right now) for me to ignore the realization that everything I touch after the paper is also contaminated. And likewise, just because I *don't* see it doesn't mean something hasn't contaminated it. 

You're right--everything has bacteria. I realize it's in the air and on surfaces and just everywhere. But in my head, it's one thing to see my counter tops and cabinets and fridge as 'clean' because I've cleaned it, versus after my father-in-law opens the trashcan lid with his hands (despite it having a foot pedal), putting his beer bottle in and pushing it down (thus touching all the other trash in there), then immediately going to my fridge to get another drink and putting it on my counter top. Or simply putting their car keys in their pocket or purse and coming to give me a hug without even considering how those keys have been in contact with their wallets, and therefore their money, and therefore the previous person who touched that money and so on.

I used to cringe and try to covertly keep them in a room or two so I have less to clean when they leave, but I've gotten MUCH more relaxed about it and just clean everything after they leave. I've gotten very relaxed about going out and sitting in a restaurant booth and just being 'contaminated', but when I come home, I need to shower and change before sitting on my couch. So although I'm calmer now, I still need to clean. That's the main battle I'm trying to overcome. I want to have people over and not have to mop and disinfect my couches and Lysol my counter tops. 

I will definitely let the things you pointed out sink in. You said you were afraid of germs, too... how did you overcome that?"

"Lol I'm done with this. How you can gloss over everything I just said and in the same breath accuse me of ignoring your logic is laughable but let's take this step by step. Your logic: We need Arthur Morgan to be canonically bisexual (originally gay) so that we can normalize the LGBTQ community. Anyone who disagrees with me is clearly against the normalization of LGBTQ in society. My argument: Tacking on a sexuality to a pre-developed character just for the sake of normalizing that particular community is lazy writing and it makes you come off as having an agenda. Now there's no confusion. Granted you'll skim through this comment, pick out the parts you don't like, and then accuse me of being afraid of normalizing the LGBTQ community which is totally missing my point even though I literally just spelled it out for you. Anything to add? "

"In the current form of the Roman Rite it's really fallen out of popularity, but it seems to swinging back. In the 23 other Eastern, non-Roman Rites it's prevalent. I also feel like location plays a role. For example here in Texas it's uncommon but still happens, and I feel like the Latinas wear it more than whites. So that leads me to believe in Mexico wearing one must be more prevelant than the USA. But at the Traditional Latin Mass nearly every female wears one.

Pious to wear one, but not required. Not even in a church where 99% of women wear one. The Holy Sacrifice won't be halted because you don't wear one."

"KDE's Kwin Window Manager already does a surprisingly good job at being a Wayland compositor and the likes, the Plasma desktop team have absolutely no intention of switching to Mir, when their own work has payed off.

I've had this happen on many occasions when I put my laptop to sleep and it's really annoying going to my next class and seeing my session die as soon as I lift the lid.

My friend has tons of these
"I still think the tank duel with the Tiger was legitimately fun. The engagement range is ridiculously close, the Tiger’s turret traverse speed was way too fast, and the 76mm gun on the Sherman shouldn’t have had that much trouble penetrating armor. 

But it’s a movie. And the scene was actually a pretty good action sequence with a heavy emphasis on tension. I liked it. 

The rest of the movie was garbage, though. The final action sequence is so overwrought and excessive, especially in comparison to the (attempted but dramatized) gritty realism of the aforementioned Tiger duel, that you start to zone out after a little while. The fight should have lasted 5 minutes but it just keeps going like some kind of blood-soaked Energizer Bunny. 

The characters weren’t just poorly fleshed out, most of them were actively despicable. The entire scene in the occupied German town was a long, intensely uncomfortable, and rape-y takedown of every character involved. The whole thing felt like a study in sexual assault but I’m not sure the director had the same perception which makes it so much worse. John Bernthal’s character in particular was so disgusting that you almost wanted to root for the Nazis in contrast. 

And finally the entire message of the movie is utterly and completely botched. I think it’s trying to be a message about the power of mercy and basic decency in the face of war, in that Private Protagonist is spared at the end of the film by a German soldier that is supposed to be a parallel of himself, since he was also unwilling to kill at the start of the movie. But this is horribly undercut by the progression of his character throughout the film. He begins as a sympathetic figure, but after a few fight scenes he’s just as much of a blood-starved killer as the rest of the crew. He begins as someone afraid to take a life, but he ends as the angry guy behind the .30 cal, sending a whole belt into lines of opposing troops while literally shouting spittle-flicked “FUCK YOU”’s at them the whole while. And then *after* this transformation, Bernthal has this speech about how Private Protagonist isn’t like the rest of them? That he’s basically a good and decent person? Did the editor mix up the order of these scenes? What’s going on? 

I’m not even some anti-war wonk or anything, and I get the idea that you kind of need to de-sensitize yourself to violence to be effective in war. That’s one thing. But these characters seemed to actually *relish* the fighting instead of endure it. And this is seemingly presented as a positive growth for our protagonist. You made it, kid! Good job! You too are an animal. A “machine”, even. And then we’re supposed to swallow this pivot to “decency will win the day” by the end of it.

I’m brand new to this subreddit. I got my first bass a couple months ago and my main question is about bass setup. I think I have the bridge saddles set up correctly but I’m not sure about the truss rod. How far do you usually adjust the truss rod and how often does it need to be done? Also is there anything else I should be doing to make sure my bass is playing the best it can? I don’t really want to pay to have it done at a shop. Thanks!
A immunization shot works by injecting a small bit of the virus your trying to be immune to into your bloodstream. Your body sees the virus and starts creating antibodies to kill it. But the virus is so weak it’s killed off by you body’s natural defenses white blood cells. But now you have a bunch of antibodies waiting on you body for the next time you get that virus and you body can immediately react and use the antibodies.

I would say it isn't a terrible phone but I think the performance is a downgrade from the Moto G5 Plus. It also seems much less durable. I have dropped my Moto G5 Plus many times from high heights onto hard materials and it has never cracked (it has stayed in a case). My brother has the same type of case on his G6 and he has a small crack across the display after just 2 months! He is relatively careful with his phones and swears he doesn't know how it cracked; I was apparently the first to notice it. I can say that the Moto G6 is worse than the Moto G5 Plus, so I assume that it is much worse that the Moto G5S Plus."

"Part 4

“You… you know me?” I asked. Matias’s eyes darted between me and Professor Hopper, but he was being uncharacteristically quiet.

“You don’t remember me?” the professor asked, his voice a little hurt.

I stared at the man in front of me. He did look sort of familiar, but it was hard to tell if that was just because he was so generic. He sort of looked like someone had brought a stock photo of a professor to life. I found myself disappointed that he wasn’t wearing a tweed jacket with leather elbow pads.

“I’m guessing that’s a no,” the professor said, responding to my silence. “I’m professor Reggie Hopper. You can call me-”

“Uncle Reggie!” I said, the name suddenly jumping to the front of my tongue. I did remember him! He’d been my mom’s friend, and we used to see him all the time when I was around five or so. And then, suddenly, he had stopped coming to visit. I never knew why. “You and I used to get italian ices,” I said dumbly, not sure what else to say.

“Yeah, we did. Before your mom decided to stop letting you eat sugar,” he smiled wryly, leaning back on his desk so that he was half seated on a mess of papers and books. The motion made him look younger, and it was easier to connect this scholarly and weathered man to my vague memories of young and fun loving Uncle Reggie, always ready to take me on an adventure.

‘She’s still on that,” I groaned. “And now I can’t eat gluten or dairy, either. She wants me to have ‘optimal health conditions,’ or something.”

“Which is ridiculous,” said Matias, his need to criticize my mom overwhelming whatever had inspired his sudden silence. “Why does it even matter what you eat? You’re a robot.”

“That’s a really good point!” I exclaimed, suddenly overwhelmed with the injustice of being deprived junk food at home. I'd of course continued eating garbage at Matias's place, but it was the principle of the thing.

Uncle Reggie ignored my outrage. His expression was serious, and just a little sad. “You know?”

“That I’m a robot? Oh, yeah, for a few months now,” I replied. Uncle Reggie’s brow furrowed

“It’s why we’re here,” Matias added. “We want you to remove her limiters.”

“...I need a drink,” said Uncle Reggie, ducking behind his desk to pull out a bottle of what I assumed was scotch or whiskey. I was thirteen and had never had either, but that was the sort of drink that professors kept in their desks in movies and TV shows and Uncle Reggie seemed intent on embodying those sorts of stereotypes. He poured a substantial amount of the bottle into a “World’s Best Professor” mug and took a swig. “So first off,” he said to me, “You are not a robot.”

“I’m pretty sure I am,” I replied suspiciously. “When Matias stabbed me, we found metal.”

“Don’t say it like that!” Matias exclaimed, wheeling on me. “It wasn’t a stab, it was… a scrape! A scrape for science!”

“I don’t even want to know,” groaned Uncle Reggie. “And it’s besides the point. You’re a cyborg, Sofia. A blend of biology and technology. We tried to use as many biological parts as we could, because we wanted to make you as human like as possible.”

“We?” I asked. “Did you… did you help make me?”

“Are you her dad?” blurted Matias.

This got an eye roll in return. “There was a team of about ten of us who helped build Sofia, so unless you want to call all of us her mothers and fathers, I’m not sure the term applies,” he said. Then he looked at me, and his voice got softer, “If it’s ok with you, you can keep calling me Uncle Reggie. That’s what’s always felt right to me.”

“What about…” my voice hitched in my throat. “What about the woman I’ve been calling my mom?”

“Professor Theresa Lee was the head of our project,” Uncle Reggie said, staring into his mug. “So I guess if you’re going to call anyone mom, she makes the most sense. She did most of the work on you. The rest of us could barely keep up with her, we just wanted to observe her and learn all we could. She was my mentor.”

“Was?” Matias asked.

“We had a falling out a few years ago,” Uncle Reggie said.

“I noticed. I’ve been reading your papers, and they're pretty hostile towards her and her work,” replied Matias. He sounded a little excited, like he wanted to jump in and start talking about the theories he’d been studying.

“Ah, then you’ve probably figured out what the falling out was about.” Uncle Reggie got up from his desk and walked over to me, putting a hand on my shoulder. The gesture was a little dramatic, but I supposed so was the whole situation. “It was about you, Sofia. I never wanted her to put your limiters in place to begin with. I think shackling your mind... it was a terrible thing. A waste of your potential.”

“So you’ll help me?” I asked, suddenly unsure of what answer I wanted to hear. I realized that I hadn’t actually expected any of this to work. That even though the past couple months had been weird, on some level I’d expected things to stay the same as they’d always been. I’d thought I could keep playing video games in Matias’s basement, passing as normal to the untrained eye. Suddenly, that was beginning to feel like it wouldn’t be possible, and I found myself scared.

“I’ll help you,” replied Uncle Reggie.

He and Matias both smiled at me, but I didn’t feel happy at all."

What the fuck. I just went on their site and they were selling 'Psychic Vampire Repellent'?

This is what it says: 

&gt;Crystal and spiritual healer Zoe Taylor-Crane distills the mood-lifting, therapeutic powers of gemstones into gorgeous elixirs and mists meant to clear toxic energy, promote calm and creativity. A lot goes into her luscious formulas, from vibrational healing and reiki-charged crystals to sonically tuned stones and restorative oils. 

Why is this even a thing?"

"The cool thing about Vanilla is that spec doesn't matter nearly as much as it does in retail.  You can heal out in the world and in instances no problem, just throw on a set of MP5 (+mana per 5 seconds), +int, or +healing gear and you'll do fine with just about any talent points.  That's what's so awesome about hybrid classes - you're actually a hybrid instead of an enormously gimped hybrid (that can cast maybe 3 heals and then go OOM) as it currently is in retail.  Your capacity in other roles may suffer - you're not going to be the best at everything all at once - but you can typically fill more than one role at the same time more or less effectively.

If you want to be ""efficient"" (as efficient as one of the slowest levelers in the game can be), go Ret and switch to Prot when you can get reckoning, as FL14 suggests.

But genuinely, just throw some talent points around as you see fit and have fun more than anything.  Nobody will judge, because if Blizzard implements Classic as it was back then, nobody will be able to inspect your talents, lol."
Footage of brown people dying is to be gloated over while footage of Americans dying is disrespectful or something
"If I'm not wrong, the Japanese lost a few of their CAs due to the torpedoes getting damaged and blowing up, damaging the ship beyond saving. The most famous case was during the Battle of Samar, where White Plains, a US escort carrier, managed to incapacitate Choukai with the single 5 inch secondary gun on the rear of the ship by detonating the torpedo tubes of the cruiser. Due to the placement of the tubes, the explosion pretty much took out the entire engine of the ship, causing the Japanese to have to scuttle Choukai, and making her the only warship to have been sunk by a carrier's guns."

"My recommendations for your CECS classes after looking back at Spring '18 and this Fall schedule:
- 229: Varela or Goldstein. I had Varela. She's a machine when it comes to lectures, i.e., very few breaks while lecturing. Her assignments are interesting &amp;&amp; we did them in Python.
- 328: Same as above. I had Goldstein. He's a good prof and loves teaching that class.
- 323: Brown or Monge - I can't speak on anyone else. Monge is, IMO, the DB person (Brown uses Monge's site as a reference). Brown was a DBA for something like 30-years so...it's in his blood. He gives way too much work though. IDC if he curves, he gives WAY too much work.

Honestly, if you're trying to do 5 classes AND work, then good luck. It's not impossible, but just remember: the burnout is real and not worth it."

"D'ya know - I recently solved this issue myself - I had one of those big Leatherman carabiners lying around, so I used 3 of the corners for different things:

&amp;#x200B;

[Picture here.](https://i.imgur.com/3bJXdhT.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Reduces the bulk and sits much more comfortably in my pocket/hanging from my ignition now :)

&amp;#x200B;

So, the car key is attached to a super-cheap S-Biner which allows me to detach it if, for example, I left something in the house and the Mrs needs to go grab it without turning off the engine (also works to keep the little one asleep witth the vibrations. This S-Biner is attached to a hex hole on the Biner so it can't move anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

The Leatherman has a very tight ring (...) which I squeezed onto the carabiner, so that doesn't move from its corner.

&amp;#x200B;

The house keys/immobiliser is on a conventional keyring and can move about, but because I'd be holding one of the 3 corners, they revert back to their corner anyway - EG: I pick the keys up by the car key, the house keys slide down to their corner, out of the way.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that it's across a long carabiner means that it can fold over on itself instead of all the key heads bulging out the shafts.

&amp;#x200B;

All this key terminology sounds dirty.

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah, that's my super-exciting rundown...of my keys.

"&gt;Do you watch, like, everything that's currently in cinemas?

I just didn't want to go back and write (2018) on all of them, wasn't trying to draw attention to it.  But yes, I'm actively trying to watch as many films as I possibly can in the year that they come out now.  Back in 2016 when I joined FG, I was embarassed I couldn't participate in any current discussions, and there's a rich indy cinema going on out there that I wasn't in touch with.  In 2017 I saw about 80 during the year, having usually seen 15-20.  I have 160 on my list for 2018, we'll see how much I get done.  I'm at 80 again now.  

&gt;I understand watching movies because of directors, or actors, but because of a studio... That's new for me.

For me, too.  Last year I posted a breakdown of A24's budget/release decisions and tried to make sense of them because they had an inordinately high number of quality films compared to other indy studios.  4-5 films they picked up are probably in my top 25 all-time, and that surprised me.  As I watch more and more of their releases, though, it ended up evening out.  Still, it's a company I plan to keep tabs on, especially since now they're producing.  "

People keep classifying Karthus as a late game champ, but when you get good at landing those Qs consistently he actually has a very strong laning phase against almost everyone. 10x Aery procs can put an enemy champion on a kill threshold early game before you can even use Predator active."

"Statistically you're still going to get in one. Even with you defensively driving you have everyone else who never learned on the roads with you.

If those cons all together are something you can handle and the car wouldnt put stress in the case of loss of a job by either party then you're probably financially set enough to disregard my advice.

But even then. Stinger with no backup car? If you go ahead and get the stinger since it is such an unknown at this point of production I would HEAVILY consider getting a cheap beater."

She has had many very confident moments.... in fact the vast majority.  But that one moment when the TARDIS didn't come, she was convinced she'd failed.that was very weird to me, especially when they are still helping us get to know her.  If that happened in her second season, we could say that's weird *for her* but happening sp early on... it kind of forms apart of our impression of her overall personality.

All that said, it doesnt bother me as long as they are going somewhere with this and developping this slightly less confident Doctor.  If they play it right, she could be viewed as a more humble Doctor, which would be a fun twist."

"Hey bro, job interviews are weird. Each one has a different vibe to them because each interviewer is different and the questions asked are different. I hope you aren’t still hurting yourself because you matter. They were just trying to see how your skills qualify you for the job. Maybe you don’t have IT experience, maybe you don’t have an education on paper, however, maybe you’re a self learned person who has gained knowledge through the internet and have a little passion for technology. If that’s the case then I think IT is a good fit. Like I said job interviews suck and I think all jobs do to but some are better than others. Either way, you got the interview which means whatever document you submitted to them(resume or cover letter) looked good and was well written. Job interviews can be tough, especially when your thoughts are elsewhere besides answering a question about IT when you’re thinking deeper emotional thoughts. Don’t let this ruin you. I went through numerous interviews before I got a job and I failed on some of them so hard. Keep doing things you love/like in the meantime and stay safe please &lt;3."
This doesn't sound like it's the pharmacy's fault. It sounds like your doctor wrote you an Rx for a 4 month supply of Nuvarings with directions for a 4 month supply which insurance won't cover. They will only cover 90 days usually. This is why the pharmacy asked for a change in directions to explain to the insurance company why you need an extra ring every 90 days. So now the insurance company needs to contact your doctor to find out why you need the extra ring and decide if they will allow it. If your doctor had written the Rx properly to begin with and contacted your insurance to make sure it would be covered then the pharmacy would have not gotten any computer errors back from the insurance when they tried to fill your script and gladly given you your meds. I promise you the pharmacy is not trying to make you jump through hoops. They are trying to get your medication covered for but they are at the mercy of your doctor and insurance company.

"On our demolition site we use ozito rotary hammers. They're not too bad, but the main reason is they're cheaper than the Makitas that we use on special occasions.

"&gt;  I can see how it would be no less than infuriating in PVP

It was nuts, although you could dodge it if you moved fast enough. Once you thought the other guy had antidamage on, you just spammed the buster and hoped to run fast enough to not eat 300 damage.

&gt;I never actually did PVP

That's really too bad. PVP was amazing in that game. The jank combos like Rock Cube into Airshot, Areagrab (or multiple) into Geddon then walking over all your tiles and unleashing Snake, building folders to counter your opponent's elemental weakness - man I miss those days."

"It depends on what difficulty we are talking here. If you raid normal then sure you don't need it. But I personally couldn't live without weak auras. It's such a flexible addon, you can make a lot of useful stuff with it. Range indicator circles, flashing/glowing icons for boss abilities or your own abilities when they come off cd or proc, incoming damage timers, big text stuff to remind you to do something important, you name it. It's really useful because some boss abilities could be crucial to do properly and dbm timer is not enough. Let's say a dbm timer will say ""gaze of ghuun in 10"" but with weak aura you can make it pop a flashing icon and also say ""turn away!"" so that way you will never forget to turn away. Just visit the wago. io website and explore a bit, you gonna find a lot of useful weak auras I'm sure! "

"On paper your assessment appears to be correct but in practice is not. If you are not a fighter, the earliest your average character with a two weapon fighting comes online is level 6 when improved two weapon fighting becomes available. Until that point, you are taking a -4 with both attacks where a two handed fighter is only taking a minus 1-2 depending on his base attack bonus. On top of that you may not be dealing full damage with your off hand weapon.  Your investing your feats into making two weapon fighting suck less and by the time it rivals twohanders , ac as a core defense option is out the window. The name of the game at that point is avoiding harsh and crippling spell effects that ac is not going to protect you from that. 

I’m not sure how you got the idea that two handed characters are less accurate. Maybe it’s because you get more attacks sooner but those extra attacks aren’t accurate on their own.

Two weapon characters get nothing for free . I’m not saying it’s bad, or not fun. I’m saying as the game progresses dex is less optimal especially in the core table top. In Kingmaker, since we know how encounters can go, we are better equipped and two weapon fighting dose not seem as bad. They (owlcat) made a lot of concessions to make dex based characters viable when in most situations it’s not an optimal choice

"Actually, that was the first time they broke up a few years beforehand. But it does relate to how they broke up the final time before the marriage.

They broke up because Stan Lee suggested to the Marvel leadership that Peter and MJ should be married. So they felt the best, most mature, and straightforward way to end one relationship in favor of the other was to turn Black Cat into a crazy vengeful bitch still upset over their last breakup so she slept with the Foreigner and plotted to destroy Spider-Man’s life, but she had a change of heart, betrayed the foreigner, and then left for Europe.

My years in dev led me to develop a program we called a quality checker. Essentially, it'd take a massive .csv dump from a few machines, trim the fat and spurious values, and then concatenate the values into a number of SD points.

People tend to look at automation too heavily as a first pass.

It's not quite true automation, but 11 years later my yellowed, faded bar codes are still stuck to every machine I put them on.

Byron is specifically making the point that Tristan doesn't/can't pay attention to him. You are attempting to refute this point by showing how Tristan has paid attention to other people. This is nonsensical, because in addition to being *generally* selfish, Tristan has a *specific* problem with treating his brother as a person, with legitimate perspectives, wants, and needs. 

Two separate things. You're conflating them. Like I'm sure always happens when Byron tries to talk to people about this. He's essentially in an abusive relationship and being gas-lit by his brother. Trust the victims, not the excuses of their abusers.

You had a Treasurer who kept track of party money and all magic items found as a group. 

You had a Mapper, who would make copies of any maps the DM provided or would draw them himself as the DM described them in game. 

You had an Ally and Villain Tracker who kept the names of each and every NPC the party met and whether they were a potential ally or bad guy. 

We had a couple player act as Quartermasters for the group. Making sure the group was geared properly, everyone had rations, weapons cleaned and sharpened, armor in working order. 

There are other roles you can assign as needed. Doing this truly enhances the team mentality also. "

Then I use some more leave in conditioner spray and use the towel to pat my hair down.

"Op, on the one hand, they attempted to commit fraud in their fatally-late application to perfect their security interest. For this they can face punishment, though it would involve the police and not necessarily you.   
On the other hand, implicit (and often expressly written) in every contract is a duty to cooperate.
But no amount of cooperation is going to fix their screwed up late filing. So basically they own a note that is unsecured and you are still required to make your monthly payments. If you fail to do so, you could be sued for an unsecured debt.  
My advice would be to keep making your payments and make a paper trail to document the fraud. Whether you contact the police or write the state title agency is up to you. "

"&gt;And again, Winter and Night have been pointed out time and time again as having a lot of things in common. There's plenty of reasons to think that if Winter can open a gate, then the Night might be able to as well.

I agree that if the night is capable of creating portals, copying winter power is probably how they'd learn to do it. I just don't think it's likely that they'll get that lucky.

&gt; But I'm thinking of more ordinary faeries, Larat for one, but also others we saw last book (I'd have to go searching for exact references, which I might have time for later).

I'm pretty sure it was outright stated at one point that the only fae who can open portals are those with the power of a prince/princess.

&gt;I doubted they understood everything I could do with those, or even that I wasn’t the only one who could make them: the Wild Hunt could open its own, if it was led by Larat. 

Yeah, it seems like the only one of Cat's followers who can open gates is Larat, the fae formerly known as prince. 

I'm not saying it's impossible, but the odds of a fae prince wandering by the area the Mighty are in, getting into a fight, *losing* that fight, and then the Mighty figuring out how to reverse-engineer a portal using night- all in the next day or so- is pretty damn low."

As you can probably guess, this thing is very old and is very outdated lmao but it has done me for, like, 7 years at this point!

Although, I'm considering buying a new 3DS in the future since the screen is scuffed and it's very slow and barely runs any games well. Some stuff I wanna know:

If I were to buy a new 3DS, would it be as simple as just logging onto my NNID account and I'd still be able to access all the content I have on this 3DS I currently use?

I also want to get a new SD card since I got this SD card with the 3DS when I bought it and it holds only 2gb which is quite dismal lmao. But like, for example, if I replaced that SD card with a new one would I lose things like DLC in Smash, or just unlockable characters or both?

"&gt; If you find comfort in living in your echo chamber and believing what you want to believe

Would someone who was actually in an echo chamber really spend time actively seeking out opinions they disagree with on a subreddit purpose-built to better understand their political opposition from the perspective of that opposition?

I'm not in an echo chamber in the slightest. The very fact that I am active on this subreddit is proof in the pudding.

When I encounter a popular political belief I disagree with, my first reaction is ""what am I missing?"" My first response is to try to figure out what train of thought or what personal experiences I don't have would lead someone to disagree with me on that issue. Because if I don't have a good understanding of the experiences and perspectives on the other side, how can I know that they aren't actually fully valid and that it's me that's wrong? After all, by definition, does that not mean that I am lacking some of the available information?

People's consistent failure to do this is literally the most concerning thing to me right now about our political divide. Because if we can't start doing this as a society, the divide will only grow wider. I'm confident I'm doing my part, but if it's only me, then it won't do much good."

"I like the advice you got to call APS proactively to report the threats of abandonment of a gravely disabled senior citizen.  APS can probably also give you advice about what to do if Doolittle is abandoned on your property.  It might be to call the police or an ambulance. I am not a lawyer but from experience in the social services and your description of Doolittle's capabilities, I am pretty sure that SIL would be committing a serious crime if she makes good on her threats.  At that point, it would be reasonable to assume that the abandonment was part of a pattern of neglect (missed meds, malnutrition, etc.), so it would make sense to treat it as an medical emergency.  Since you have researched filial responsibility and are in the clear, this should get her off your property without you having to incur any financial obligations.  Just make it clear that she cannot come back to your property after treatment."

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

(Sorry for formating on mobile)

It really all started a year ago when I befriended C and C was friends with H but H disliked me greatly at the time and when I befriended C, H helped me out of a really tough time and she pretty much saved me from suicide and she is the one that keeps me going with my life. Then C befriended E and was pretty close with each other but C, H, E, and myself were really close friends.  Then E started having problems and H was at a bit of the brunt of it and E didn't really realize this, so E was hurting the feelings of the friend group including a new member S. She seemed like she was being mean but she always said that she was being sarcastic and we could never tell and she always put herself down alot as well so we let it slide for a few months.  Then H got sick of it and as I quote ""called her out on her bullshit"". I didn't know what to do in the situation with H just plain insulting her and then E got defensive and it ended up being a shouting fight and they both don't like each other and I don't know what to do into the situation also I'm a guy but all my friends are female and I don't know if that affects it but I want to know because I don't want to lose both friends but I want them to be happy, and E and H are very stubborn but S and C are saying I should probably knuckle under and let it blow over but I don't know if it will. 


So T.LD.R I friend that saved me from suicide is having a fight with another friend with problems going on and I don't know what to do.

Hi /u/mypervertedstories!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

&gt;####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

&gt;* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

&gt;* Don't post or claim to know someone in the photo unless you can verify permission to post the photo.

&gt;* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

[Please message the Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmilf&amp;subject=Verification%20Request) with proof that:

`A.  You are actually the MILF in this photo`

#**-or-**

`B. You can verify that you have the MILF's permission to post this photo.`

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/milf/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of your nude/semi-nude body from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/milf written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

The photo does not have to be artsy or fully nude, but semi-nude is the minimum. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to post your face, we do need to see a good amount of your nude/semi-nude body.

Thank you for your cooperation!

"Only big issue with jumping from Chinese straight to Korean and wanting to read, is that Korean grammar is actually kind of complicated at the beginner level unlike Chinese. It needs some actual study and isn't really something you can pick up from reading alone at the beginner level. I don't know any graded readers for Korean, but know that Naver Webtoons has tons of free Manhwa to read so that is a place you can eventually get quite a lot of use out of. All the Grimms Adventurers stories are available in every language online, but those are not neccesarily easy reads either.   


I would suggest starting with Lingodeer (App), How To Study Korean (Website), Talk to Me in Korean (Podcast), etc to begin with to get your solid beginning in the language. Good luck!"

"Yo no dije que la oposición ""sólo hubiese encontrado el tema del título""; primero que nada, porque el tema del título no lo encontró la oposición (al menos no de manera directa, digamos). El tema del título fue a partir de un trabajo periodístico hecho por las periodistas Patricia Madrid y Viviana Ruggiero.

&amp;#x200B;

Segundo; el trabajo de la oposición ha sido buscarle el pelo al huevo. No es serio pedirle la renuncia a un vicepresidente ""porque la oposición dice que..."". Ya ves; 180 folios y fue procesado por 2 cosas (una de las cuales no estaba aún en ese momento). Lo demás fue circo nomás, porque no podés decir que la justicia sea servil al gobierno (ver múltiples declaraciones de inconstitucionalidad a leyes promovidas por los últimos gobiernos, las condenas reducidas y libertades anticipadas a delincuentes, etc). Y, como dije en otro comentario por acá, en la constitución uruguaya está garantizado el principio de presunción de inocencia. Pero ni siquiera tenemos que llegar a eso, porque el comunicado del FA es de del 5 de marzo, y la denuncia por ancap recién se presentó en abril. O sea que, ratifico, lo único que tenía Sendic pendiente con la justicia al 5 de marzo de 2016 era la denuncia presentada por Salle por la usurpación del título, 2 días antes (por lo que fue absuelto, además).

&amp;#x200B;

Acá, lo único que me parece que tiene la burda intención de reescribir la historia es publicar un comunicado que perteneció a un contexto distinto al actual y sin hacer ninguna aclaración, con toda la intención de hacer quedar como que el FA, que hoy en día se está desmarcando en masa de Sendic, tiene el doble discurso de apoyar a un delincuente convicto... cosa que no fue así. Y apoyos a compañeros que luego resultaron ser procesados ha ocurrido en todos los partidos y de todos los colores."

"Paying others to log onto your gaming account and get an item for you.

Yes, yes, “time vs money”, but what makes this infuriating is that 1) this usually breaks the game’s user agreement, meaning it’s a bannable offense, 2) it’s usually ridiculously high prices, and 3) the people who paid hundreds of dollars for the item are insufferable human beings who mock others who do NOT have the item with “lolol I have [item] because I am a gaming god with a 36.8 KD and you are worthless scum who should uninstall.”"

For example, Donald Trump has his products made all over the world, from Mexico to India -- anywhere but the US, in fact.

We will soon reach a OWG status again and we will be permitted to do it this time coz enough lessons from history have now been learned for it to actually teach us the needed lessons we have to learn - that in truth we do horrible things to each other, we abuse our weakest members and that as a species we are a little child currently learning the lesson of ""power"" coz when we are given power we destroy ourselves with it... it's just what we are.

"**record: 5-2-2 +41.65U**

Euro League 19:00 CEST

3U: Eintracht Frankfurt vs. Apollon Limassol +1.0,+1.5 @ 1.90

yeah surely, on the first view Frankfurt seems to be a goal scoring machine. 3 out of the last 4 matches were won by at least 3 goals difference. 7:1 against Dusseldorf, 4:1 against Lazio, 4:1 against Hannover. but actually those are the only 3 matches Frankfurt won clearly this campaign. all other matches weren't won or max won by a single goal. Frankfurt scored 7 goals against Dusseldorf and 4 goals against Hannover. but both teams are defensively and overall bad af in Bundesliga. Dusseldorf sits in last position with second most goals allowed and Hannover sits one position ahead of relegation area with the fourth worst defense. okay, Frankfurt won 4:1 against Lazio, but Lazio got 2 red cards...

surely Frankfurt isn't actually comparable with teams from the cyprus league. but Limassol sits in second position in the cyprus 1st division campaign. they scored 18 goals and allowed ONLY ONE GOAL in their cyprus campaign.

Limassol also doing well in Euro League and its qualification. they haven't lost any match with more than one goal difference. they even played 2:2 against Marseille, lost only 2:1 to Lazio and kicked Basel out of Euro League in the last stage of qualification. Limassol lost 3:2 in Basel but won 1:0 in Cyprus where they didn't even played in their home stadium.

Frankfurt's #1 goalkeeper and former PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp isn't yet cleared to play. also some people saying that Frankfurt's coach is may not going to field the best starting XI against Limassol and rest some players for the next Bundesliga match 3 days later. also with forward Rebic back in starting XI, the role of Jovic, who scored 5 goals last match, changes a bit.

Frankfurt could just once kept a clean sheet this campaign. at all other 11 matches Frankfurt got at least 1 goal, while Limassol scored at least 1 goal in 13 out of the previous 15 matches.

fought about Limassol over 0.5 goals @ 1.60  or even over 1 goal @ 2.50 as potd. but taking the asian line on Limassol which is already a half win half push if Frankfurts wins by one goal difference.

&amp;#x200B;

e.: that was a L(ol). first goal for Frankfurt happens this way only once in a million times on this level. hard luck. pick would have hit otherwise. also very big triple scoring chance for Limassol in the second half. again hard luck. it shouldn't be this time."

Griffith had the ""crimon beherit""/""egg of the king"" which is special, in that it's only granted to someone worthy to be the head of the godhand, so by connecting the physical and astral world, sacrificing what is most dear to him, he gave away his humanity to accomplish his dream.

Never seen a more fragile ego- which fits the psychology of a moron cop perfectly.  You question someone's service (without reason) ... allude they they only worked in the motorpool so they couldn't have a frame of reference of the content ... and then get butt hurt when they actually are way more high speed than you ever were or can be, doughnut boy.  I told you I wasn't tabbed, genius.  Never claimed to be an operator, kid.  When you try to manipulate conversations in your favor (more evidence you're a moron cop) don't be surprised when a much higher intellect puts you in your place.  And don't confuse my lack of civility as childishness- its an easy mistake yo make when you have a 3rd grade reading level.

Another give away that you are a moron cop boy-child ... your idea of substantial evidence of my service is that I support my claim with an easily available and researchable MOS (BTW 11B is the only MOS civilians know, chud).  Instead, to prevent this exact response I knew would come from you, I give you the specific campaigns, operating area, headquarters, parent unit, operating unit, and the disposition of subordinate units and you say that is less likely that I served, lol.  And you wonder why I don't trust you or any of your bootlicking boyfriends' judgement.  You have displayed the very institutionalized lack of logic and critical thinking skills that I'm pointing out in the OP- you are not qualified to comprehend your own brain, let alone use it in public.

Its incredible that you can't juts realize you lost this, this morning.  Its unfathomable that you think you are making a point.  What is most entertaining to me, is that I know you are sitting at home getting ready to grab another doughnut, red faced and veiny becasue you can't point a gun in my face and legally harass me to show your perceived superiority and ""win"" in your eyes.  Or try to cop a feel of my dick while you are slapping cuffs on me.  Without your uniform, shield, gun, taser, night stick, civil protection, and constitutional backup ... you are worthless.  You're a professional bully.  I very much look forward to watching your close friends and family suffer through your public execution when the mob comes.

Some day, you'll grow up and realize the world doesn't run off your opinions or what you do or don't believe.  It doesn't change reality just becasue your feelings are hurt.  I know this is tough news for you to take and I'm probably going to be responsible for you taking your anger out on some minorities, women or children on your next beat, and that fucking sucks.  But people like you need to know that the folks that stood on a wall defending you, once aren't there anymore.  We are standing on a different wall surrounding the poor and oppressed and you're on the wrong side of it, bootlicker.

"You could try, but you would have no grounds. If your child is physically aggressive, it is not their teacher's job to be their punching bag. Physical abuse is never acceptable, and when it threatens a pregnancy that's just taking it to a whole nother level. 

Why should teachers have to suffer concussions, broken bones, heart attacks, miscarriages, etc. because your kid is aggressive? Not only that, but the kid is a severe liability to other students, too. 

A public school might not be allowed to refuse service, but a teacher sure as shit doesn't have to deal with daily physical abuse just because your kid is special needs.  

Special needs does not mean they can do no wrong and should never face repercussions for their actions. Being a teacher does not mean having to take whatever is thrown at you. "

"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/us/when-americans-were-illegal-immigrants-in-mexico.html

In 1830, Mexico passed a law banning almost all immigration from the United States and provided for military garrisons along its border to enforce it.

Col. José de las Piedras, writing a letter (in Spanish) to Stephen F. Austin, the “father of Texas,” reported that he had encountered the immigrants east of the Trinity River heading west in what was then Mexico toward Austin’s colony, west of modern-day Houston. He checked them for passports, but they had none, so he ordered them to leave Mexico pursuant to the new immigration law. They talked the colonel into letting them tend to some business in the colony, though, by promising to return and then exit the country within 20 days.

“But in contempt of the laws of the country and of its authorities and a total disregard to my orders which they promised to obey, availing themselves of the obscurity of the night and unfrequented roads, they took off” — with their families — “and are now on their way to your town, as I am informed by Colonel Bean, who met them on that side of the Trinity” River, Colonel Piedras wrote in the letter, which now resides at the Texas General Land Office.

“As they have come into this country contrary to law and have disrespected the authorities,” he continued, “I think they ought not to be admitted.”

It is hard to be certain what happened to those immigrants, though some of their names match those of families who got land in an independent Texas. What is known is that thousands of immigrants defied Mexican laws in coming to what is now Texas before the Anglo settlers declared independence from Mexico and formed their own nation, which later became the 28th state."

"Well I think china locking them up for reeducation for a few weeks or months so they don't turn into Islamic extremists is less of a human rights violation than locking millions of people for Non violent drug offenses like weed.

Isn't locking millions of people up for years and ruining their lives over weed, where USA has even legalised it in other states. This just shows that even USA knows it's bullshit. How is this not the biggest human rights violation in USA or even the world? Locking up millions and ruining millions of lives.

Isn't that a fucking massive human rights violation. USA has 25% of worlds prison pop and only 5% of world .human population.

So tell me why USA can tell china off for this. And especially when they themselves started two fake wars and have KILLED hundreds of thousands and tens of thousands of innocents and are still currently dropping 44,000 bombs a year in 8 different countries and selling billions to Saudi and helping them starve 12 million in Yemen.

If china didn't do this but then later invaded multiple countries and drops 44,000 bombs a year and kills hundreds of INNOCENTS every TWO WEEKS like USA, would that be preferable? Is that what a civilised country who respects human rights does? If so, then fuck human rights.

But china bad. Ok. Watch me get brigaded now because I told the truth about both countries actions in war vs terror and also USA locking millions of people up and even having for profit prison system. They will make those millions work and make profit off them. It's basically slave labor."

"It’s hard to make anyone view things from your perspective, even if you take the time to view things from their perspective, most people will judge things at face value and dismiss it.

This is why movies are amazing to me, 

they convey one’s perspective to another, brilliantly.

This movie has made people feel.

In any movie review of James Cameron’s AVATAR, we are mostly told it is praised for it’s CGI and not for it’s story. Which for the most part, lacked originality. Comparisons are made to previous stories. 

Stories such as Ferngully, Pocahontas, and Dances with Wolves. 

In fact, it was common for people to simply say, 

“AVATAR is (insert movie) in space”. 

What astounds me is that while people compare AVATAR to these films, 

they do not compare it to the events and situations that these films are focused on. 

Events and situations that are still ongoing to this day.

AVATAR uses symbolism and imagery to portray the atrocities committed by the Corporatocracy. 

And, how our ignorance not only allows these atrocities to occur — but, also has halted our evolution

AVATAR is not only a social commentary on the Extortion of Natural Resources, 

Exploitation of Indigenous Peoples, or Aboriginal Genocide. 

It is a simulation of what life can be.

It does what no film has EVER done before,showcase our connection to the Earth. 

Every claim in the analysis can be researched by anyone and a clear consensus can be reached.

"I did an oxalic acid drizzle in 3deg Celsius weather and found a few hundred mites on my bottom board the following day or two. Worked amazingly. I also did it in a lower concentration and amount with great success. Mind you my hives are overwintering In a single deep, so the treatment was 25ml/colony of oxalic acid at 35g(oxalic acid crystals) dissolved into 1 liter of warm 1-1 syrup. And it was 3ml in between each frame that had bees. Drizzled across the frame 1 end to the other. Note that is for 1 deep box with little to no brood. The treatment varies for double deeps etc. It's also recommended to only do this once or after a different treatment because it can be a bit hard on a weak colony. "

"I’m sorry, but if you accept god as a creator then nature = god, you can phrase it that if it makes you feel more comfortable.

Its not at all the idea that god intervenes in anyway, thats a specific application of a belief in god, which is not the discussion. God doesn’t need to *do* anything.

If you have heard of simulation theory you can attribute god to the thing that created the simulation. For all The argument cares god could have said “let there be light” flipped a switch, and walked away to let the universe do its thing.

God (should they exist) is natural by definition. 

Plenty of arguments against specific interpretations, definitly with you there, but not against the potential existence of a creator being."

What's another highly developed nation surrounded by hostile third world nations? 
These laws were in place when they got this land. Most likely the lands property value reflected the laws in place in their area. So by breaking those laws they essentially said they want to buy discounted land and profit off of it by breaking local laws. Let me be clear. They're not victims but rather they're just people who wanted to cheat the rules of their community for a quick buck. There are many laws in place that hurt the individual for the benefit of the community. For example no matter how much money I think I can make off of it if I try to create a giant lake on my property I would face significant legal repercussions. That you don't understand these concepts shows that you have a very poor understanding of how society works in general.

"I’ve had this exact issue when playing BF1 for over 2 years.

Two Titan X (Pascal) in HB SLI

I’ve had PG278Q and PG27UQ over the past two years and both support G-Sync.

Turning off G-Sync would allow the card to push to 90-95% usage. G-Sync on and my second GPU usage would drop to 65% along with a big hit on FPS.

Everyone said I was crazy. I should try X16/X16, I needed to roll back drivers, fresh OS install, open a ticket with NVIDIA.

So I did open a ticket with Nvidia. Nvidia tried blaming BF1 devs. I pushed back and got escalated to tier 2. They said they were unable to repro the issue and the support case pretty much died there.

Never going with SLI again and this backs my choice."

"Regardless of whether he should have been stopped or not, these police were assholes and blatantly biked through a red light after the stop. My whole point was that if you’re going to be upholding the law, you should be an exemplar or following the law. 

I’ll add that the bike cops were also biking the wrong way down the street when they stopped the guy. 

Again, the street was a one way for that one block. The guy was biking, doing nothing wrong, and then incidentally it turned into a one way. "
Nice
That's the one

Excellent!
"Because I was excited for the show and it was maybe the worst concert I’ve ever been to. The aforementioned aspects of the venue/crowd weren’t just lame but like borderline-offensive to me. 

It felt like what I imagine a Dave Matthews concert would be like. "

In this video it went from day to night in 3 minutes?
"It's not like we couldn't just take the oil and the money they would have spent on weapons sales.  Lockheed doesn't really care if we sell the missiles or launch them, so long as they are consumed.

We may be deferring to them *way* too much, but that doesn't change the basic power balance here."
"&gt;Sources that are conveniently hidden.

I provided the citations for them, if you can't be bothered to do a 2 second search on google scholar for the name of the paper then why should anyone expect you to read it? And no, it's not hidden, it's under a pay wall. I have access to it because I'm still associated with a university. Go to your local university library and ask if they have a guest pass that you can use. Take the time to actually read some of this.

[Here's an undergraduate course, online, for free, on the subject, you say you're interested in the topic, go for it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM&amp;list=PL22J3VaeABQApSdW8X71Ihe34eKN6XhCi)

Sounds like you got a virus fam

I'm ok with it. 
the four guys below are saying the same things about their wives
"There is a difference between trying to hit a missile coming at you and and a maneuvering warship at range, and while the AP is almost certainly enough to riddle Belfast's softer parts, her belt and turrets would likely be too thick for such low calibre ammunition.

I did see the video, but aside from highlighting a high RPM burst it doesn't demonstrate any ability to knock out a warship from an age when attacks were stopped with armour and not missiles or CIWS."
"""(Oven baked)"" lmao! The struggle is real. I ended up buying a G4 which bootlooped on me so I bought a V30."

"To reach the same age difference, I'd have to wait fifteen years from now for my wife to even be *born.*  Not trynna say anything negative in a ""praise Jeff"" thread, but... damn."
"MK Disco, but I'd really recommend stretching your budget up to the One 2"
Actually it more specifically won't run on unlocked bootloaders (which is unfortunatly a perquisite for installibg lineageos). The solution. Look up root hiding yourself in a different sub because the easy solution is banned from discussion here (hint: it sounds like magic. Just google it)
"It blows my mind that so many people can't believe writers do this freehand.

Is my way of thinking corrupted because I honestly don’t find much wrong with this. Sure its insensitive and a little immature but its not transphobic or anything.

Well they are both bad but the local Domino's offers anchovies so that's a W for me.

"You can also use analyze which is an ability granted by Kelsus’ TMR and one other item I can’t recall right now.  Also on an esper (siren maybe?) and a few units (HT kid for sure, don’t know the rest)
