"There are plenty of stories where people have lost the weight with no effect. A few where it has had an effect. 

People are entitled to whatever turns them on. The usual pattern is that somebody changes from A to B and the person is turned off by B.  Your guy liked you as A and B - now you are A again and he says he is turned off.

When I first ""bailed-and-didnt-know-it"" (like 2008) , I was feeling a little guilty, but I thought it was a nice break due more to economy than ""waking up"". I felt so guilt-like, I started ""preaching"" on-line. And that was when the can of GB worms opened up. I thought, eventually, oh well, no reason to feel guilty now, who can be worse than these guys? I feared them, but not that much really, I could see they were sort of hollow for some time now, all stalled and repeating old crap ad infinitum. Then I really saw why.

Then I couldn't stop my xJW campaign, it was like a volcano and obsession, plus it was fun and web efficient and became more and more real the more I did it, like by 2012. The more I dug, the more bones I found. Reddit is a unique forum, it really gives JWs on the edge of flight on their own wings many views, and no trolls or roadkill harangues where the WT ran over someone and they sort of stay smashed to the street-- everyone seems to be moving forward in their own time here from all the help to do so here. It is what it is kinds of posts, no theology arm-rassling matches, and the stuff I found at other forums.

It is a high dosage get the hell out of JW Org message board, diverse but civil, imo. I think it will be very helpful to JWs finding out the same actual truths we all found out."

"They buffed the damage of almost all CB attacks except for the best combo (the left click spam). Left click spam is STILL best combo making all other stamina consuming combos kinda worthless. The dodge is harder to use than the dodges on other weapons. It's the only weapon that requires +6 weighted strikes to boop. It's lowest damage right now probably but if you're good with them, of  course you can still get gold slayer. Gold slayer doesn't mean you did the most damage in the group though. CB constantly gets bugged. Back in Coming Storm, LLR would deal insane amounts of hits, making it insane for damage and elemental proc which they took out. 2 patches ago, they made the chainblades able to boop with left click and fully charged backflip. Some other bugs CB had were weird artifacts spreading out from the CB that made it hard to see, backflip would teleport you someplace, and sometimes you do a chainpull when you're doing a backflip (this happened a lot with the backflip boop because you can see the aetheric explosion from the backflip but the character does a chainpull animation)."

**you make a video calling dash a scam and you make one patting monero on the back?** clearly your a monero troll that has a huge biase and nobody should take you as credible.﻿

 And unlike the instamine, which was a bug, the cripple mine in monero lasted for months and was **deliberate**!

&gt;Re: Unveiling the truth over the major Monero scam

&gt;November 20, 2015, 12:36:04 AM

&gt;1. NoodleDoodle's commit was May 7, so the start of dga's mining was after May 7, or 19 days after launch. **We know his hash rate reached 4045%** by May 14, or 26 days after launch. i.e. during most of the first month he wasn't mining at all.

&gt;2. **Clearly his hash rate was below 50% for much of the time and only rarely (and not even with certainty) above 60%.** There is no evidence it ever reached anything close to 90%, and certainly it wasn't close to that for any consistent period.

Monero **_*is*_** Bytecoin (bitmonero was forked from Bytecoin who the monero devs call scammers, while the bitmonero miner was written by *actual* scammers)"

"I said my original instinct was to agree that this was a false flag, but just slow your roll because nothing is definitive.  That wasn't acceptable because I didn't 100% accept the opposite of the MSM story.  You're toeing the company line for Q and unwilling to budge that there could be other explanations.  You are laughable.   "
Sure but when a company claims that there is 45 ounces of down in their bag when there is clearly not...I question it. 45oz of down is twice what Western Mountaineering has in their 0F bags and still more than what their -40F mummy bags have.....Forgive me for not trusting their ratings or specs.

"You are bad at having any idea what you are on about. Clearly people rush to stores for supplies because the stores run out of stock on things like bread, the subject of the discussion. If people were just making sure to get bread on their next shopping trip, the shelves wouldn't be empty because supply would keep up with typical demand.

You keep harping on this idea of ""it's good for a few days and people are presumably without power a few days."" The point is people are concerned about not having power, refrigeration, and water but they buy idiotic supplies like only water and only bread. You can visit a store near the arrival of a hurricane to see those things sold out. People are concerned about having something to drink, they will buy out all the shelves of water but leave plenty of soda, which contains water and would allow you to survive. They buy out all the bread, which only lasts a few days and is a poor source of nutrition, yet the shelves are still packed with plenty of shelf stable products that are more nutritionally dense, again better for survival. 
   If everyone adhered to your attitude of ""well it is just a few days, it doesn't matter"" then they wouldn't be buying out any of this stuff, because most anyone has enough food in their house for 3-4 days.

It would be like if candles were all sold out during hurricanes, but the shelves were still loaded with flashlights and batteries. ""not sure what you have against a freaking candle!"""

"Wow nice catch!! 

But if the anime only has 24 episodes, I’m curious how they will manage to do it, since we haven’t met Hinata yet. In top of that, they’re following the manga very accurately, so I don’t think they will skip anything. And I don’t think this opening will last more than 24 episodes. 

This might be ‘false hope’ opening like that one from One Piece where we saw Luffy fighting Kaido in whole cake island but it never actually happened."

"&gt; Westerners, but yes. If you live in a success story like the West and hate it and want what the USSR had, then you're an idiot. If you live in abject poverty, you do not live in the US, and can be forgiven for socialist fantasies.

So...you're admitting you are wrong and now attempting to save face with an attack? OK, as long as you admit it was a euro/amerocentric statement. That's all I'm talking about here.

&gt; You're thinking of a rich person who had a business built. That person got their money from an ancestor who did build something. Good for them. You've never worked in a small business setting, but owners tend to work very hard to build them from the ground up.

LOL. I've worked a number of small businesses. The bartending job was great because the owner would help out by getting drunk and letting me drink too. 

By build, I'm talking about physically changing something into something more valuable. They hire people for that shit.

&gt; My town has an actual socialist history--several mayors. In the 80s when unions controlled our politics they had all the factories paying unskilled labor as much as white-collars with college degrees. Unions could strike for 2 months before factories could hire scabs. And then the factory jobs disappeared like a fart in the wind and never came back. Great job, labor!

You'd almost think that after several decades and the gutting of labor in the 70s, it may have been related to something else...NAFTA *cough*.

My pops lost his blue collar gig in the mid 1990s when they moved to Japan. He wasn't union though. Meanwhile, the aunt and uncle I'm talking about are working the same union job in the city next door that they've had for DECADES. Blaming labor doesn't account for, ya know, globalization, that thing that labor militantly opposed before the right coopted it."

She knows that i am not a fan of big surprises. I like to be told ahead of time. I try not to interfere with her decisions but i do have to get used to some ideas before they happen. 
So now she is on her trip through europe (after finishing school) and she suddenly decided that she and her friends should get matching tattoos. I was not told until monday. She is getting the tattoo today. I do see how she couldnt tell me a lot of time in advance but i do remember jokingly telling her not to do something that will make me mad before she left. 
I am now upset because i really am not sure how i like the idea of her being tattooed and me not even knowing the design. 
She just said that this situation didnt go well for me and blames me for ruining her exitement.

"Try r/IKEAdelivery , this sub is not the place for these kinds of rants.

However, IKEA is struggling to adapt to the American market. There can't be an IKEA on every corner, so every online order comes from the distribution warehouses. These aren't as well-staffed as people think. IKEA is trying to revamp their whole online ordering system to make it work better, but the fact is they will never be as good as their competitors in that area.

I get that you're frustrated about your refund, but keep in mind that there is a lengthy process they have to go through. Normal coworkers can't process refunds, so they have to get their managers to do it. At the call centers, that's a small handfull of people having to sort through hundreds of refund requests EVERY DAY. They get to it, but it takes time. The coworkers that promised you it would get done have no power to actually get it done themselves, they have to rely on the managers to get to it in a timely manner.

If you're in a hurry, IKEA stores are great. If you rent a U-Haul, you can have everything selected, purchased, and brought home all in a day. If you do the online ordering, they are always behind and you will encounter delays like you did. Relying on a company you've never done business with before to supply your entire apartment's worth of furniture is like walking into a brand new fast food restaurant and demanding their most expensive sirloin. You had no idea what the IKEA online delivery process is like, and you paid the price for it. Start small when exploring a new business."

No game ever goes perfectly like planned. Sometimes your backup QB gifts a pick-6. Sometimes you fumble the ball twice close to your own endzone. What matters is how they react to those circumstances and in 2 of those games they managed to overcome them and win. Weak-willed teams would have fallen behind and stayed behind. This team has shown it can comeback and that should be a source of optimism.
Pretty spectacular how quickly DICE went to shit after BF4.
I’d RL based on that date wheel 22. You only see 2 dates so you have no idea how many numbers are severely off centered like that. Either RL or ask for more pictures showing other dates. 
Today's media would phrase it as a question and immediately go to a commercial brake. They collect the commercial revenue and aren't ethnically accountable for anything. Perfect!

"Well, striking the coin at least twice doesn't create doubled dies - it happens when the dies are created:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubled_die

Well, as far as the consignments go, the LCS approaches me with coins to sell for them.  They don't really have any problems acquiring coins - people bring them into the store all the time.  The last big consignment I did for them was when they purchased the collection of a former customer (apparently enough to completely fill an SUV.)  The only times they've asked me to find coins for them was when they were trying to complete an Early Commemorative Set and had a few they couldn't find.

I've been trying to get them to let me image some of their coins so they can list them online, but a couple things are keeping them from jumping on board: 1) they don't want to add any additional costs to their inventory and 2) they don't want to have to manage inventory control while coins are available online - if they sell it at the store, you have to end the listing, etc.

I'd say there are many venues where you will find coins.  Coin shops, pawn shops, sometimes jewelry stores, antique malls, flea markets, estate sales and auctions, yard sales...not to mention coin shows...and then you have the Interwebs.  I've had varying luck with all.  

The best way, though, is to build relationships with other dealers and/or collectors - because then they will bring the coins to YOU.  I have a dealer who knows I like imaging toned coins, so every time I see him he has a pile of toners waiting for me.  The LCS know I like world coins, especially silver, and they like having someone who will buy that stuff (because not that many people do it, so it just sits for a while.)  I have people at the flea market who bring me boxes of stuff.  Auctioneer used to have tons of coins, as he's gotten older (and gambles/drinks more) he doesn't have nearly the amount of inventory he used to.

The key, I think, is to be friendly, to be present, to be persistent, and to be patient.  Find an area of opportunity and get to work learning.  Rainy day? Open that Cherrypicker's Guide, find a 4-figure variety, and see if you can find one.  Learn the difference between normal luster and dipped/cleaned coins.  Figure out what kind of toning collectors consider attractive.  Learn to spot CHOICE examples of coins and learn to say NO to ugly problem coins.  

I mean, there's so much to learn, so just start somewhere and remember to have as much FUN as you can.  If you don't enjoy it, it will quickly become a tedious task and not a hobby."

"This is very true. Also, how silly is it that we have 24 hour trains on weekends, but no buses to get from station to home at such times?

So you pretty much either need to walk home or get a taxi/Uber. So instead of your city daily fee, you also need to pay for a transport car. Can cost upwards of $15-20 just to go to city.

No wonder people drive into city. I can park for $8 24 hours on weekend."

"Well, vegetarians are omnis, it does include them. Agreed though, most of them are the exact same as the animal-eater ones. Sometimes literally, because lying about being vegetarian is probably more common than actually being vegetarian.

So anyway thank you for being so kind, this is a strange place to be mentally and I hope you never have to go through it. It’s hard to listen to reassurance when your like this sometimes and I’ve been suicidal for years, long before I worried about my dick size. I don’t really know why I started worrying about it so much lately, maybe to displace my emotions into something else. Thanks again, I feel better about my body after remeasuring, now I need to get my emotional health under control lol"

I gaurantee you the kid at my work did not come up with that on his own, I'll bet it comes from some right wing talking head. 

That analogy makes the assumption that there are definitely bad people in that group, and is used to continue their agenda of fear mongering. 
A better analogy is trick or treating. Is it possible somebody might hand out tainted candy? Maybe, but that doesnt mean it's a guarantee, and you check your candy before you eat it.

Instead of having a discussion about my first point, you tried to disregard my argument by claiming my personal experience doesn't matter. Nevermind you haven't actually bothered to provide an argument of your own because you don't have a good one. But fine, I'll give you the real answer to who spends the most: It's urban players because most of the profits on mobile games come from ""whales"" who, surpirse, don't live in the middle of nowhere but in big cities because that's where people with a lot of money live."

"That figure means that for every 100 grams of brain tissue, your brain gets 55 milliliters of blood per minute. So a brain that weighed about 1.3-1.4 kilograms (which is a fairly average brain mass) would get around 750mL/minute by that formula.

"&gt;curvy, wide noses 

haha, I thought you were talking about a different body part when I saw ""curvy""  

I can agree with the lips, but that's the first time I've heard someone describe a wide nose as ""feminine"".  A flat nose I could maybe see, but I think a wide nose is pretty universally considered masculine.  

For what it's worth, those features don't have anything inherently to do with being darker--they're just correlated with the specific darker ethnicities (African descent) that are prevalent in the US.  I meant more dark features independent of everything else.  I'm dark but I've got even thinner lips and more facial hair than most white guys, which is pretty common among Arabs/Indians/even Aboriginal Australians.  

What I'm saying is that a Black guy would probably be seen as more masculine than the pale skinned version of himself.  "

"I get the whole mint-in-box thing, but as with the comic book spec market or the original Star Wars figures, if nobody ever takes them out an plays with them, they won’t ever become valuable beyond whatever nostalgia for them exists in the future. 

Nobody thought those Luke and Vader figures would amount to anything, but then those of us who grew up playing with them and had them thrown away or donated spent real money on buying those rare figures still on the card that had been accidentally stuffed away in attics and basements. Around the same time, comic books started offering variant covers- the vast majority of the fandom bought all six copies of each issue(foil, bas relief , penciled variant, etc) and bagged them immediately because they thought they’d be worth as much as an Action #1. That ideology severely damaged the comic book industry. Keeping Funkos and other toys in boxes ultimately destroys their investment value, because when everyone has a pristine copy, or even buys two of the same so they can take it out, then nobody will be interested in paying for them.  Yeah, I know it’s a sentiment of Syndrome, but it still holds true for collecting.

"They are both levers that the BoC (Bank of Canada) controls.  By lowering rates, they've created demand for loans, which found their way into the economy.  Looking at M2, there are a lot of loans out there.  Some - myself included - might argue that the boom since 2000 has been mostly the result of cheap rates and the printing of money (liquidity).

It all works until investors start to demand higher rates on their savings...driven in part by increasing prices (too many $$$ chasing goods like housing).

I'm not an economist and books have been written on the subject, but there is so much debt on public and private balance sheets right now that there could be a liquidity crisis when the money printing ends....which it eventually will.  The stock market is signalling that this might not be too far off in the future."

I made 3.400 euro with it and now I invest 1.980 on that to make it even more. But it's okay to take it slow and safe. Money never comes for free...

"""Terrorists murdered 3,342 people on U.S. soil from 1992 through August 12, 2017. Islamist terrorists are responsible for 92% of all those murders. The 9/11 attacks, by themselves, killed about 89% of all the victims during this time. During this time, the chance of being murdered in a terrorist attack committed by an Islamist was about 1 in 2.5 million per year.

Nationalist and Right Wing terrorists are the second deadliest group by ideology, as they account for 6.6% of all terrorist murders during this time. The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the second deadliest terrorist attack in U.S. history, killed 168 people and accounted for 77% of all the murders committed by Nationalist and Right Wing terrorists. The chance of being murdered in a Nationalist or Right Wing terrorist attack was about 1 in 33 million per year.

Left Wing terrorists killed only 23 people in terrorist attacks during this time, about 0.7% of the total number of murders, but 13 since the beginning of 2016. Nationalist and Right Wing terrorists have only killed five since then, including Charlottesville. Regardless, the annual chance of being murdered by a Left Wing terrorist was about 1 in 330 million per year.
Terrorists inspired by Nationalist and Right Wing ideology have killed about 10 times as many people as Left Wing terrorists since 1992. Terrorists with unknown or other motivations were the least deadly. Islamists swamped them all.""

"while you're correct on the Scandinavia  small particle study . 

you're not correct on the studded tire/ non studded tire comparison. 

I've done a lot of auto racing (17 auto racing championships, many of them in Rally racing)  I've also taught at some driving schools.  

on any type of Ice or even packed snow,  Studded snow tires provide better traction.    

Areas that get icy roads , studs can mean the different between getting to your destination safely, or needing a tow or having to leave your vehicle behind for safety reasons. 

Icy uphill , car in front of you stops, and now you don't have the traction to start from a stand still.  you'll be out of your car , along with many others, breathing in car exhaust (which ... increases your chance of cancer)  

usually though 4wd vehicles with dedicated winter tires will often be able to stop and start on nearly any surface.   2wd vehicles benefit more from the studded tires (esp RWD) in  terms of being able to stop on a road, and then begin moving again. 

disclaimer - Studded tires (or even really good winter tires) does not mean you should drive exceedingly fast in winter conditions.  :) "

"Giving both names to kids has been very common ( over 20% of kids given both parents' last names at the trend's peak ) in Québec for long enough to give the following problems :

Louis Gauthier-Mercier and Amélie Bouchard-Tremblay are trying to figure ""how the fuck are we going to name our kids?"". And the Feminist argument in favor of giving both names was thus defeated by reality : you can only, by law (and for sanity), give two last names, so you still end up having to sacrifice one (or two) last name(s).

And suddenly, a lightbulb switches on in people's minds, ""ooohhhh, so that's why societies settled on ONE last name for the family unit"". 

Duh. 

Now less than 10% of kids are given both last names."

"While I disagree a lot with the pastor’s decision 100% I will say there is some argument against what you’ve said.  No matter if it’s fact or fiction the Bible is filed with very flawed characters (except for Jesus) and is aware of this, most of this is used to highlight sin and stuff to legitimize a need for a savior. David is the perfect example, he is called a man after God’s own heart but he still isn’t perfect. What  he does he is punished when the child conceived between him and Bathsheba dies. He is also filled with remorse (look up Psalm 51, it’s all about David begging for forgiveness for what he did.)

With Lot it’s more of a cultural scenario, remember this is 
A) before Jesus so you can’t make the argument “righteous man” meant  the same thing when it was written (a time when Judaism wasn’t even codified) and the same interpretation we have now (a holy, good person who follows their religion near perfectly) 
B) women were basically property then so this might not have been seen as the horrible to the people (men) of this time even though yes, what Lot does is wrong but he is only human after all. 

 Looking through 2018 lenses and judging everything in the Torah, Bible, and Quran is extremely easy but everything in almost any ancient religious text has so much cultural context and this context is often ignored by people. Even religious people ignore context, like most Christians often think the letters of the New Testament (everything after John) should govern the church but in reality these letters are outdated and were each written for specific churches with different cultures (they’re even named after the churches they were sent to.) 

And finally not all Christians are as conservative as your pastor. Many are fairly open minded (for Christians) but they say and do many noncontroversial things so people don’t really care to talk about them.

Yeah... I call bull shit unless you're some super famous publisher where all your articles are the top google search. And most people who read articles don't even look at the author. So he was definitely searching specifically for you. But it doesn't hurt to find out how he found you so you can prevent it from happening again in case you get someone way worse than him.

Your server will be tagged as “Official” in the match list. Official servers cycle through standardized maps and settings to give those joining a solid Murder Miners experience---not one in which some abusive, ban happy host is playing on some lame, exploitative map with shit settings. With your help “No sessions found” can now be a thing of the past. Please consider hosting Official servers when no other server is up and joining them to attract other players.Sentry! Remember how I said, “With the zombies getting so much more powerful, how can the Murder Miners even hope to survive?” after the ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS update? Well, this is what I had in mind. It’s currently the alt fire of the sword. Since we’re still fine-tuning it we’ve made it disabled by default (You can enable it under “Weapon Options” in the pregame lobby).All the very best to you guys,-JForce Ty(Btw you may have to restart steam to get the update.

"Or better yet, shipping fetishes from one place to another!"
"There's too much to put into one post.  I'll highlight the main things:

Everyone who went to TI8 and PAX West was told they were getting access to the beta in October.  Bruno said that for people who couldn't make it to those events, there'd be more ways to get beta keys.  Those ways to get beta keys turned out to be having to enter raffles where you needed to follow and retweet content creators, plus follow (sometimes subscribe) to their twitch stream, and sit through ~1 hour long streams to be present for the raffle.  You usually had around a 0.1 percent chance of winning, so people thought it was shitty that the content creators were using the beta keys from Valve as a way to get thousands of people to do free promotion for them.  Things finally boiled over when the mods did a key giveway where they made a clicker game called ""banana clicker"".  People sat there clicking non-stop for up to an hour, only to find out that the game was never tested with more than a handful of people, so it couldn't handle the thousands of people trying to get a high enough score for a key and people's scores kept resetting.

Next is the weird NDA Valve has with the closed beta testers.  They are allowed to talk about pretty much anything they want with the revealed cards, but can't show any gameplay footage.  So there's tons of people in the beta posting videos and tweets about how much they love the game, but nobody else can even watch the game, let alone play it.  Since their videos can't include any gameplay footage, it's basically just them re-hashing the same footage from PAX over and over.  They also keep posting card rankings and deck lists, which makes it seem like they've already had time to figure everything out, and that the meta will be stale on day one because you'll need to copy the decks of the beta players if you want a chance to win anything.

Next, some people don't like who Valve invited to the closed beta.  It's mainly people like BTS, DotaCinema, and pro players from other card games, but some are also just friends of Valve employees.  Smaller content creators don't like that BTS and DotaCinema were basically given privileged access to the game, because they've already had a chance to pre-make enough content that they'll be able to drown out any smaller creators that haven't had months of early access to the game.  Most people are fine with the pro players getting early access for balance testing, but since everyone else has to pay for cards before they can do any testing, the beta testers are going to have a big advantage because they had close to a year of free access to every available card.  That ties into the fact that there's a 1.7 Million dollar prizepool Artifact tournament scheduled for early 2019, which the beta testers will probably have a sizeable advantage in.

Finally, people with beta keys from TI8, PAX, and raffles were supposed to be able to play in October.  Valve didn't say which day in October it was going to start, but people with keys were getting antsy half-way through October.  On October 19th, Valve moved the beta back to November 19th, just 9 days before the scheduled release date.  They didn't even make a real announcement, they just sent an email to people that already had beta keys, and removed the beta date from their twitter account.  So the people who spent hours participating in different raffles, and the people who spent ~$200 on beta keys from PAX, now only get 9 days early access instead of the 1-2 months they were expecting.

Those are the major things that made the sub toxic.  Also, any complaints, even valid ones, were met with responses calling the poster entitled and whiny.  Even the mods were being toxic to posters.  The mods also haven't created an FAQ or anything, so you constantly have people posting the same questions over and over again, making the sub seem extra toxic because those posts are normally downvoted immediately since it's the thousandth time the same question has been asked.  There's a lot of smaller stuff you can see if you look through the sub, but that's the major stuff."

"Already playing with it and yeah, it wants a monster box to have a ""nice"" curve.  It's that .707 Qts most likely.  The sad part is it will be doing nothing worth hearing by 60Hz, too.  Too much inductance, too much mms.

It's all in the volume, too.  Changing the tune lower than 34Hz makes things worse.  Only way to make any improvement is more box volume.

WinISD isn't everything, but I don't like how that woofer models.  I wouldn't want one myself.  If you could get up to 7 or 8 cubes you might be better off.  Beyond that there's not much improvement for the extra space.  And at that point I'd use the space for a pair of XFL 15's instead I think.

I started lifting later on and put on a good amount of weight, ran a marathon, and did much more. Some of the kids in my gym class became junkies and hs dropouts.

"NRA: ""Q: How many NRA spokesman do you need to change a light bulb? A: More guns.""

“*One only wishes Wayne LaPierre and his NRA board of directors could be drafted to some of these scenes, where they would be required to put on booties and rubber gloves and help clean up the blood, the brains, and the chunks of intestine still containing the poor wads of half-digested food that were some innocent bystander's last meal.”*

"Let me give you a different perspective. When I was in high school, my friends were dicking around and dropped a piece of heavy furniture on my foot. It snapped a bone. I told my parents and begged them to take me to the doctor. They didn't. I walked on a broken foot for months. At 21 I had to get an x ray on my foot and thats when the doctor discovered the old break. I have arthritis not only in my foot but also my knees and hips from walking so wonky for so long. My foot sometimes goes numb for no reason. When it rains, sometimes I can't even walk it hurts so bad. This is going to end up costing me thousands down the line. Am I saying your daughter's leg is shattered? No. I am saying those $30 could be worth it if it prevents lifelong problems."

"Actually, about 85% of my encounters (which I experience every day as someone who is a channel for spirits to contact) are positive encounters. 

Usually, they just want to talk. Sometimes they just come to me and sit with me for a while. Sometimes they ask questions about what I'm doing. Sometimes they ""rant"" to me. Sometimes they ask to bring me somewhere and will lead me to a place in the house or outside or even have me go on a drive somewhere. I genuinely think most spirits and ghosts simply want to be WITH someone. I think a lot of them are just, like, lonely? They were humans, y'know? Humans need social interaction, no matter what phase they're in.

One time, one of them even left me a flower on my bed after us having been talking for a few months. I have reason to believe it was from them because I had specifically had a conversation with this spirit about this particular type of flower. 

I think the positive ones are just drawn to me because they know I won't harm them/they know I have a nurturing personality and accept everything with open arms."

"A passport doesn't always mean citizenship, but in this case (like 99% of cases) I think it would and you'd be an Irish citizen. That would probably give you access to Irish and EU universities and other benefits, depending on what extra requirements exist for people to get them (residency, etc). It would also make it easier for you to work permanently in Ireland if you wish, or to work temporarily in the rest of the EU like any other Irish citizen could. And it would make it easier for you to enter countries that accept Irish/EU passports better than the American passport - that's usually not an issue, but there can be annoying visa requirements or quirks with passport expiration dates that a 2nd passport would help you avoid if you travel a lot.

It's definitely worth digging into, as the benefits may be worthwhile. The countries where it could be a bad idea are those with mandatory military service (Russia, Israel, South Korea, etc) - though even in those cases there is usually a convenient workaround.

*The ""passport doesn't always mean citizenship"" thing happens in countries with complex former-colonies and territories acquired various ways. So people in American Samoa are American nationals and have US passports, but aren't citizens - the main difference is that they can't vote even if they move to mainland US. I don't think Ireland has that issue, or they just solved it by grandfathering everyone in. "

"&gt; Should I dump a lump sum of money into the TFSA or stick to $400/month?

Probably lump sum, unless you want to dollar-cost average.

&gt; Can I keep my TD credit card without a TD account? I been using it for many years, have a good credit score and its free.

Probably but I'm not sure. I also remember someone saying that there is an annual fee TD credit card but the fee is waived if you have over $5,000 in a TD account. I'd recommend looking further into the details of your credit card yourself (checking the TD site or calling them and asking about it). Also, FWIW, I know Tangerine offers a pretty nice no fee credit card (2% cash back on 2-3 categories and 0.5% cash back on everything else).

&gt; Should I have my RSP with Tangerine or WealthSimple?

Probably Wealth Simple. The funds should be similar but I'm pretty sure Wealth Simple has slightly lower fees.

&gt; Overall am I making the right decisions or is there something else I should be doing?

Seems generally good, one thing I might recommend though is focusing more on contributing to your TFSA rather than RSP (assuming your TFSA is not maxed out), unless your employer is matching RSP contributions, since you are currently only making $1,000 a month."

"I know. My point is that it doesn't necessarily get better. You can't help someone by just painting with broad strokes. What happens if your entire life you are promised that it gets better after high school? You wait and watch and hope for that point in time. Well, for people like me, college was a soul-sucking point of life. Of course, everyone will say that it just gets better after that. Then, it quite possible becomes even more unbearable. What do I think of the people who gave me that advice and encouragement? I think back to their uselessness. I realize now that they just didn't want to put in the effort to really understand where I was coming from. They didn't care about me anymore than the next random dude on the street. They just didn't want me to give up because they didn't want the bad feelings involved with me giving up, so they push on this false hope onto me that it ""gets better"". It might for some people, but if you're like me, it only got worse.

Nothing personal against you. I think you are a generally good person for encouraging someone you don't even know. I just want you to be careful of the way you go about it."

"&gt;But no one (including children) should be made to participate in religion via any justification. That is what indoctrination is, forcing / brainwashing someone to accept that which is untenable e.g. ""God loves you, you better love him back or you're going to burn for eternity""...

Alright then, thanks for demonstrating what my OP already said.   You're against religious parents raising their kids according to their religion, and think it should be made illegal. 

 

&gt;Sure you are... So now you're equating a religious law with a law that would be non-religious...

Yes, it's called a reductio ad adsurdem.

&gt;You're admitting that any law based on religion is batshit insane? Why is that?

I'm not admitting anything, I'm just demonstrating the hypocrisy of it all.

&gt;You're disregarding the 3 logical absolutes.

What ""3 logical absolutes""?

&gt; Atheism is just enunciating someone's position on theistic claims, by itself that states *nothing* about whether they think religion has a negative impact in the world and want to proactively oppose it (anti-theism). All anti-theists are atheist, but not all atheist are anti-theist. 

A lot of them are, though.  Pretty much every single one I've talked to on the Internet has been, at least partly, an anti-theist.

&gt; Making parents teaching their kids illegal is practically impossible, however stipulating rules about *what* should be taught is not. 

 So you're admitting that you want the government to regulate what parents teach their kids?  

&gt;For example the daughter of the Joseph fritzl, after being isolated in a dungeon and raped by her father for \~20 years, what kind of misconceptions do you think she'd have about the world as a result of that kind of ""teaching""?  

Locking your daughter in a dungeon and raping her isn't the same as teaching her something that most people don't like/think is wrong, fuck's sake man, how could you possibly think those are the same?"

"We don't need brakes, but I do hope my cubes could catch up to these update train."
"What you're trying to do is specifically covered in the spell's description:  
&gt;The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing.  
  
If you were limited to being 20 feet from the ground, this wouldn't work. Also note the next part of the description:   
  
&gt;You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s range. 
  
So the initial 20 foot movement doesn't mean that the target has to end up 20 feet above the ground, it's a ""freebie"" of the ability to move the target 20 feet in either direction you can use on later turns, much like Spiritual Weapon gets an attack the turn you summon it.  
  
The question is how far you can actually move up each turn. The spell says you can move as if you were climbing, so you'd be able to ""fling"" yourself for a distance equal to half your speed (unless you have climb speed). However, you can also move yourself as part of your movement, and since it doesn't specify what kind of movement that is, it's reasonable to assume that it just uses your walking speed.  
  
Assuming you have a speed of 30 (and no climb speed), each turn you could first levitate yourself up or down for 20 feet, then use the remaining 10 movement for another five feet, a total of 25 feet. Which is 10 feet more than you would normally get while climbing. Plus you can't fall."

"&gt; Do I need a lawyer? 

Yes...  More important than you having not done anything wrong is the fact that right now, they do not have any evidence against you.

And the way you keep it that way is by NOT talking to the police, and getting an attorney.

I can tell by your post that you would do a horrible job talking to the police. Don't feel bad.  Most people can't talk to the police without incriminating themselves. It's what the police do. They are good at it.

You'll go in there, explaining how you USED to have an addiction to pain killers, how you are presently on medication to help you with addiction to narcotics, and how you were riffling through their belongings and just happened to notice all the prescriptions.... And, oh... BTW... drug test me, because you will see that I am clean.

Cringe.

Get an attorney.  Do not speak to the police. If the police want to talk to you, you say: ""I will not answer any questions without an attorney.""  When they tell you that you are making yourself look guilty by saying that, say again: ""I will not answer any questions without an attorney.""

Keep saying that until they stop asking the question, or you have an attorney sitting next to you telling you to stop saying that."

Honestly doesn’t matter as the score multiplier cost the same as a duel. 
Consider:
3 separate duels
40 tokens per duels 
40 + 40 + 40 =120 tokens
Each get 8000 points for perfect farm
8000 * 16 * 3 = 384000 

1 duel with 3x multiplier
Cost 120 tokens
8000 points perfect farm
8000 * 48 = 384000

Both have a theoretical 3200 points per token farm meaning for tier unlocks it doesn’t matter.

As for card unlocks Rewards from Zane himself the math is a little different. I am tired of typing on my phone so  no math this time. Only results, if you can get a 8000 point farm consistently 1x duels are best. If you have an average of 4000 points per duel (maybe you don’t have farm deck) then 2x is best. And you might see the pattern here 3x is if you get  approx 2500 points per duel. 

Technical for any of these scenario of points per duel you did 1x. Example the if you have 480 tokens your points per token ratio for 4000 points duels with 2x multiplier cost same number of tokens as 4000 points per duel at 1x. 

Over arching story is 3x multiplier is mostly a red herring and people waste tokens using it.

"&gt; But how responsible are we for the media we consume? 

Um, we're 100% responsible for what we decide to consume and then, further, what we do in reaction to the content.

&gt; How can I make sure I maintain an interest as ethically as possible?

This I have no ready answer for.

I wish that article were better, because the question that I *think* is at its heart--is true crime a genre of entertainment or information?--is an important one. But the article throws out contradictory claims, like one about storytelling structure always prevailing and then, several paragraphs later, it asserts that _Thousands of hours of podcasts and documentary series usually under on [sic; should that be 'end on'? Was this article *dictated*?] the note of 'we’ll never know'_ . So which is it? Does narrative structure impose false endings on the stories or not?

As another poster said, the rise in number of tips to Crimestoppers most likely has *several* contributing factors. Moreover, without any data about a concomitant rise in interest in true crime, the link is even more invalid.

I also don't think the author does even a basic-level job of defining what they mean by ""true crime"". Some podcasts are information-based; others are (creepily, imo) comedic riffs on events. Likewise, documentaries are just as varied. 

I do think that there's a very deep and unsettling fascination with horrible things that many people have, and entertainment absolutely capitalizes on that fascination. I find that ethically disgusting. I also get very troubled by how some posters (not just here, elsewhere) treat ongoing cases as if they're narrative/fictional events -- expecting new twists and leaks and info, getting frustrated or worse when nothing is shared with the viewers at home.

But that article didn't do very much at all to make any kind of case. It's just too muddled.

"Honestly, I doubt anyone is going to ask you about him at the wedding. They'll probably be wrapped up in the celebration, and people tend to notice someone pining after someone else- they might have suspected he had feelings for you, in which case they definitely won't want to bring him up. If anyone DOES ask, I would just say, ""He had a last minute conflict! Bummer, but it happens."" Don't get into at your wedding, and don't sweat it! You have the next week to look forward to your wedding- you can worry about him all you want after.

As for the friendship, I think it needs a time out- I know a lot of people are saying it's over for good, but that's not necessarily the case! I would send him a text saying something along the lines of:

""Hey pal, I appreciate that it was difficult for you to share your feelings and explain why you won't be attending my wedding. Given the circumstances, there's no way our friendship could go unchanged. I care about you and am of course here for you, but I think it's healthiest for us to spend less time together while we both process this. Let me know when you feel you can be happy for me and my marriage without it hurting you- I want to be friends, but not at the expense of your wellbeing."""

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

"Both examples you have given are ones that target a random enemy at its base (*pure* random). Recall the example I gave previously, it is not *pure* random, it has a specific target priority (*ranged*), only beyond that does it become random. Muramasa's skill specifically states that it targets *2 ranged enemies*, if there are more than two, it'll randomly select two ranged enemies after prioritizing ranged enemies. This should be no different from how Sara's ability will work, assuming Mitama did not make an error in the description of the ability and I'm not mistranslating it. Her ability will target *two* Phantasma allies, if there are more than two then two will be selected at random out of all Phantasma allies (I however believe that if there is only one or no Phantasma allies at all, type-based ability priority will not target random allies of other types unlike other priority types that will select daemons at random).

Sure, Sara's ability can list that it targets two random allies, but that'll mean it will target two random allies regardless of type (pure random). (*Speculation*) The original descriptions probably did not include the *random* keyword because Mitama thought it might cause confusion; not to mention that if an ability states that it targets two enemies or allies of a specific class (i.e. ranged), it can be intuitively understood that if there is more than two ranged units, it will chose two at random.

Pure random description: `random ally`  
Priority target description: `target priority -&gt; random ally`

The translator is simply following the existing convention used in existing daemon descriptions. Take for instance, [Yaobikuni](http://otogi.wikia.com/wiki/Yaobikuni), [Muramasa](http://otogi.wikia.com/wiki/Muramasa), [Kappa](http://otogi.wikia.com/wiki/Kappa), [Cintamani](http://otogi.wikia.com/wiki/Cintamani) and many others. If you own any of them try them out, after target priority the targeting is random. However, seeing that the Korean wording is *identical* to the English version (see Sara's skill: `Reduces an enemy (healers priority) DEF`, it's no different when looking at the KR version: `스킬 : 접시 세기 - 일정 시간 동안 적 1명(치유형 우선)의 방어력을 1753 감소시킨다`), beyond the initial awkward wording of her 2nd ability in English, it's quite unlikely to be a translation issue.

If you disagree with or dislike the current convention, it would be best to suggest a change through customer support, Mitama might decide to update skill and ability descriptions to be less confusing if enough people gave similar feedback (make sure to suggest something better than what currently exists)."

"Rain.

""There is no hope now; I have heard the voice calling. It is calling to me from the storm in the sky, and spoke of trespass and blood, and hearing it I know it is the truth."" —extracted from the final astropathic message broadcast from prospecting colonies on Rain.

Rain was a colony world of wet grasslands and high plateaus in the Foundling Worlds, its flora and fauna inedible but otherwise harmless. Small prospecting and bio-augury colonies were established by a number of Rogue Traders in the late 8th century of the 41st Millennium. They found little of interest in the ecology of the planet and even less of value beneath its covering of loamy earth. The last scraps of astropathic reports from the prospecting colony talked of structures they had found in the dense forested areas of the planet but gave no other information except a note that the rain made a strange noise when it fell near them. Nothing more was ever heard from the colonies apart from a single garbled astropathic broadcast that raved about pale figures in the rain and sleek shapes in the clouds."

"My roommate’s girlfriend is from a very rich neighborhood in the Bay Area and believe it or not, not only does every house on the block buy new decorations every year, they hire people to put up and take down said decorations for them every year. 

The people who put them up have a killer business model though and ask all their customers if they can keep the decorations once they’ve been taking down since they are to be thrown out anyways and repurpose those decorations as “rentals” the next year. Essentially they have a huge supply of donated decorations and sell decoration rental services, where they will show up with everything. 

Why the people in her neighborhood continue to buy and not rent despite being fully aware of the service is beyond me. "

"If I was dually insured (which I would LOVE to be) its not that ""either"" would've covered the IUD, but rather BOTH. The secondary would've picked up most, if not all, of the deductible/coinsurance/copay amounts not paid by the primary. So yes, when you are dually covered, you absolutely send the claim to both insurance policies. And one is primary (in OPs case her vet insurance) and one is secondary.

It's a bit more complicated by that and does depend how long the relationship has been going. I'd say if it's long term then I wouldn't expect them to get dumped for it it's more of that persons attitude that could ruin the relationship. If they're fucking up finances because they eat too much or generally don't want to have sex or leave the house then it just adds to the problem. If you get dumped after 3 months because you gained 10lbs then that person is probably not someone you should have been with anyway. That's how I see these things like why would you want to be with someone that won't stick with you through thick and thin? Granted it totally depends on the individual.

I don't believe OPs short definition of racism is all encompassing, but I do wrestle with the question of: Is racism defined by a connotation of superiority, value or worth?  Or:  Is racism just deciding that the color of your skin automatically dictates a certain character trait or preference?

I assume a combination of both.  But to OPs argument, definition doesn't matter.  It's personal feelings that are the key.  "

"Regardless of the cost involved in implementing dedicated servers, whether it is expensive, or it is cheap in comparison to the overall profit they make. The fact is we had a way to play these games online for free before they started charging a subscription, and all people needed to do, to fix the instability was to;

1. Use a directly connected LAN adapter (Wi-Fi and Powerline are both bad for online multiplayer).
2. Make sure they configured their home networks correctly (enable UPnP, and don't connect two routers in series, since you will create a double NAT problem, also sometimes it helps to assign static IP addresses to client devices if your DHCP server is poorly implemented in your router/ gateway).
3. Make sure their internet service provider was providing a reasonable (doesn't need to be high) amount of bandwidth whilst (more importantly) ensuring the latency/ ping was low enough.

People have to do 2 and 3 anyway, in order for their internet connections to work properly in the first place, so that generally only leaves the problems with using Wi-Fi and Powerline adapters for online multiplayer.

Everyone needs to think about what they are giving up, and what exactly they are giving it up for. Dedicated servers will not help if people still have poor ISPs, or they aren't using the correct networking equipment in appropriate configurations.

People who claim dedicated servers will fix all of these problems are incorrect, and they are only giving them a false excuse to lock online multiplayer behind a paywall."

Some reservations still have huge swathes of areas with no electricity or running water. They had literally *nothing* for so long, they struggled to catch up, well in the many decades they struggled to catch up, society kept progressing at an exponential rate. 

Conditions and progress on reserves have, believe it or not, been increasing in their 'catch-up rate', for lack of a better term. Them being poverty level is still impressive, given what they started with, and I imagine as technology and standards of living improve and society because ever more connected, the native tribes will continue to catch up closer to the rest of American society in terms of quality of life and living conditions on the reservations.

"Normally I buy books digital.  My main concern is: will the Everyday Millionaire (EM) book hold my interest enough to *read* it when I could be reading other interesting books?  Maybe yes, maybe no.  However, at the same time, I get the audio book, which I can listen to while playing video games.  It helps that Chris Hogan narrates it himself.  (Of course, I'd probably be just as satisfied listening to Chris Hogan's voice reading the phone book as background audio.)

For me, the convenience alone (having both e-book and audio book) makes it almost worth paying $20 (assuming it'll be cheaper to get one or the other alone after release).  However, add in the physical book, and the value goes up for me.  I can either gift that to a family member, or slip it into the book nook at work.

As for the video content, I wouldn't pre-order specifically for these.  You get a video of Dave Ramsey talking about how the Bible doesn't say it's bad to be wealthy, and you get Chris Hogan talking about making sure you plan for your retirement so you're not left eating Alpo.

Some others posting have mentioning other books about wealthy people.  I haven't read those other books, and of course we don't know how EM will compare with them.  I'd say if you've read books such as ""The Millionaire Next Door"" (which I haven't), you may want to hold off until after January when people can comment on how EM compares.  If you haven't read other such books, then maybe EM can be your first.

A couple of other posters have openly suggested Dave Ramsey, his staff, and Chris Hogan are being dishonest about the variety of source of millionaires they've had interviewed for this book.  The concern is probably that the book will boil down to ""these 10,000 people became wealthy following Dave Ramsey's plan, so you should follow it to"".  I think it's premature to say this without having read the book or contacting the people who interviewed.  However, if you fear this may be the case, you'll want to hold off until after others have reviewed the book for this."

"&gt;No syncretistic faith can withstand analytical criticism. The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge. For Ur-Fascism, disagreement is treason.

&gt;Besides, disagreement is a sign of diversity. Ur-Fascism grows up and seeks for consensus by exploiting and exacerbating the natural fear of difference. The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.

It could probably use a new kitchen, double glazing, etc but even without those things, equivalent houses are selling for 10-15% more than I paid, so it's holding/increasing in value without those updates.

"Thank you! I think a lot of it is diet.  On top of what I mentioned before, I also avoid inflammatory foods... So, avoiding high-heat cooking, avoiding nuts/nut butters that have been roasted, eating very high quality fats but being careful about ""smoke points"" and not heating them too much. Avoiding cooking animal protein too hot - that can oxidize the fats, too, making them carcinogenic, and it can denature the protein. Also avoiding alcohol, sugar, black pepper/hot peppers/bell peppers (those I eat now and then), and in my case tomatoes need to be limited and are better for me when cooked.  I try not to overeat - eating a lot of healthy fats helps me do that because it's satisfying more than low-calorie foods. But I come from a history of being really clueless with my food - not being in touch with my body's feedback, with hunger levels, just eating emotionally and trying tons of fad diets. I'm glad I've finally found something that works pretty well. I still have a bit of fat on my belly, and I bloat sometimes, but I'm working with a Functional Medicine Dr to improve my leaky-gut (which tons of Hashi folks have) and I imagine that will help. "

You might want to take note that whenever there is violence, antifa is the one starting it (brownshirt tactics but hey, everyone else is a nazi!)

And my whole initial premise is that proud boys are not WHITE nationalists, which is easily debunked by pointing out the several members of color.

"Well-said.  One goal that features prominently in my own future is that of self-sufficiency.  I've had jobs of various kinds for 20 years, ever since I was old enough to legally work, and experienced a dozen different industries and work environments.  Most of them sucked. I'd much rather be poor but outdoors and growing 80% of my own food, collecting water, storing solar power etc. than better off financially but doing 9-5 at an office building with grumpy jerks and spending hundreds on groceries of questionable quality.

I've learned farming techniques and have begun looking into ways to streamline their efficiency without adding too much cost or labour.  You don't need that much land to grow an abundance of vegetable crops.  Fruit is a bit more work-intensive, but certainly doable.  Just this year I've enjoyed large quantities of home-grown apples, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages, asparagus, kiwi, strawberries, white peaches, watermelon, bell peppers, cucumbers, eggplant, romaine lettuce, squash, white onions, spring onions, shiso leaf, basil, thyme and peppermint.  Soon a crop of persimmons will be ready.  Besides the apples and tomatoes, which we grow commercially, nothing required all that much cost, space or effort on our part.  Lots of money saved on groceries, and I could be sure about how everything was grown and prepared.

I feel strongly that high schools should have a mandatory homesteading class.  Re-purpose a portion of outdoor athletic or green space into a garden.  Have a chicken coop and a diverse crop selection.  Put in some solar panels, water collection and purification systems etc.  Teach the students about all of it.  I'm fairly certain the lessons from that class will be more helpful down the road than yet another mandatory Academic class.  Tomorrow's people may lack the luxury to pursue academics like we have today.

"Of course a company has more money than an individual American. So thats not really a good comparison. You can also claim speeding can kill someone, slowing down speeds does not, so speeding should be a more expensive fine. These big companies also have top notch lawyers who would probably fight a hundred million dollar fine and they'll only end up having to pay five million anyways."
"Nope, you're confusing it with Netflix. Netflix paid for the international distribution, which put the show in the black. They do that for a lot of shows. Better Call Saul is another one where they threw a bunch of money at the production for international rights, which the show might not have been made without. 

Without the Netflix deal, Discovery would have been cancelled halfway through it's first season because nobody cares about CBS All Access."

"If you're going to make this argument it's a problem when the bonds were originally sold. That's when they and their interest, in a way, went into the debt/deficit. That's when the promise to pay them back went into the budget going forward. When they're cashed is just paying on a promise that already existed in the budget. Cashing them doesn't add to anything. It's selling them in the first place that's the problem.

I don't agree with this argument at all though. You're trying to argue that because SS surpluses were turned into bonds they became debt. That's doesn't make sense. The surplus still exists whether it's a pile of cash or a pile of bonds. It's still Social Security's surplus and you can't take it from SS and pay something else with it. It doesn't turn into debt just because you bought bonds with it.

A bond is just a loan. If you don't want to be in debt don't make the loan in the first place. Don't complain that the person requiring you pay back your loan is putting you into debt. SS just loaned the US it's surplus and is now requiring payment. It's not SS's fault the US didn't get a good return on how it spent all that loan money it got for decades."

"I feel like the way you're looking at this is a little too isolated. You're using a very textbook definition of racism and as recent years have shown, racism really isn't just a feeling that one race is superior to others. You might feel like it's just improving the accuracy of your costume, but that's not how pretty much any other person of a different race will see it. It isn't necessarily cultural appropriation, but you're using a person's skin color as an accessory to a Halloween costume. It's demeaning to someone who IS of that race. To give an example, if you wanted to go as Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee and you used makeup or some type of tape to change the shape of your eyes and speak like they do, that's incredibly offensive. If you painted your face brown, wore a turban and wore a fake beard it would be very offensive to Middle Easterners. Hell, if a person of color painted their face white to be Han Solo I doubt you'd just laugh and compliment them on the ""accuracy"" of their costume. Whether it's traditionally racist or not doesn't matter, it's inherently insensitive and offensive to any race. "

I don't think I did a good job though....

Anyway, the reason I like Itsuki, to the point I flaired him, is that I see him as more than the sum of his parts, or rather Fortuna's parts. I see him as a grounded center around which his more colourful peers orbit, and play off of. Think of him as a bed of white rice that you put curry or stir fry onto; by itself, it's boring, but when combined with the other flavours, it brings everything together.

But that's how I feel. Seems not many others do."

"No... they *shouldnt* be able to pardon that, but they definitely *can* pardon that, seeing as how trump pardoned convicted criminal Joe Arpaio for contempt of court... I know it's not right, I know it shouldn't be a thing that the executive can do, and I know it doesn't make sense (because it means that laws don't matter) but it is sadly the reality. Contempt of court is irrelevant if the president wants to allow for you to break the law with impunity.  

In the Arpaio case the conviction wasn't overturned - the judge refused to do that - Arpaio was just excused from the punishment. 

 Even if pardoning contempt of court were challenged and brought to the supreme court it is likely that the supreme court would rule that it is allowable, because 5/9 of them are likely partisans in favor of establishing lawless tyranny in this country.   "

"Combat is usually the big time suck in a game. Here's some ways to speed that up:

- Have players roll their damage dies at the same time as their attack roll.

- Share the initiative order with the players so they know when their turn is coming up and can plan for it. If a player isn't paying attention or planning what they are doing next and it becomes their turn, you may put them on a 30 second timer to start acting.

- Roll initiative for all enemies before the session starts and plug them into a table with spaces in between, and plug the PCs into that table when they roll initiative during the session.

- Use the average damage provided for monsters damage instead of rolling.

"&gt; Byron paints a picture of a Tristan who doesn't listen and doesn't care to. Whose so self absorbed in his own shit he probably doesn't even notice what's going on with Byron.

Tristan was observant of how other people treat Byron so he could make sure that he always kept the upper hand in every relationship. There's no indication that Tristan noticed or cared how Byron felt about things *including* the quote you cite. ~~Even when Byron self harms, Tristan thinks its aggression toward himself rather than because of what Byron is going through, namely~~ Tristan intentionally railroading Byron in every situation. Tristan just justifies his actions by projecting his own desire to railroad Byron onto Byron himself, who has never expressed any desire other than for Tristan to stop railroading him or rape him. It's like when a bigot gets told to stop being a bigot so the bigot accuses the other person of oppressing him. Tristan oppresses Byron and when Byron tries to get him to stop he accuses Byron of oppressing him (doubles down) and pushes even harder.

Going back to your quote, if Tristan *did* notice Byron feeling *something*, it was only in as much as it confirmed his own projected desire to railroad his brother."

"You definitely hit on a quirk of human nature. We all know that people are fascinated with serial killers but nobody's fascinated with a serial rapist in quite the same way. We might be fascinated with the idea of a rapist running around, but once they're caught, who cares?

There is a simple reason I guess. We think we understand the motivation behind rape. We kind of chalk it up to sex drive, so we kind of just consider rapist as pigs. Although we deep down realize that there's a lot more to rape, power, dominance Etc.

Yet killing is easy to understand if we look at the second motivation of rape. Yet at the same time chilling is often a sexual thrill in a way. But we just look at them very differently. So you're definitely playing with a very powerful an interesting dichotomy in the human mind.

If your joke is that a serial killer is a rapist that has gone further, you will have to set it up a little better because I don't think most people assume a serial killer is necessarily a rapist first. But your joke asks us to think of it that way which is pretty funny. So I think the idea of calling rapists quitters, not losers or unsuccessful, but someone that wasn't willing to go the extra mile, would get to that point. 

Kind of an interesting thought experiment. We all heard about Bill Cosby and we all thought it was disgusting. But what if you found out he had a dozen bodies buried in his basement. All of a sudden he's fascinating. Now that's real commitment"

&gt;**Objectives**: College students have cited the 2016 U.S. presidential election as a significant source of stress. The current study examined the prevalence and demographic correlates of clinically significant election-related avoidance and intrusion symptoms among college students 2–3 months after the election.

&gt;**Participants**: College students attending a large public university (N = 769; Mage = 19.19; 48.2% female; 58.4% White) were surveyed in January and February 2017.

&gt;**Methods**: Participants completed a validated measure of clinically significant event-related distress symptoms (eg, intrusive thoughts, avoidance) and demographic questions.

&gt;**Results**: One out of four students met criteria for clinically significant symptoms related to the election. Regression analyses suggested that sex, political party, religion, and perceived impact of the election on relationships were more useful predictors of stress symptoms than race or social class.

&gt;**Conclusions**: The high level of event-related distress is concerning because elevated symptoms of event-related stress are predictive of future distress and subsequent PTSD diagnoses."

"I got them back when they were VPI and was grandfathered into several things (I have their feline select plan which isn't offered any longer, so I get my insurance for like $20 pet pet per month with no deductible but it only covers 15 most common cat conditions). One of my cats blocked when he was 1.5 years and even though he is 10 years now and has never had another issue they still won't cover him for any urinary, so if that has changed where they will after a time then that is new. I know they talked to us about chronic issues like ear infections and allergies having a 6 month window inbetween before they would be covered. Even with working at a clinic I still am glad I got my insurance. My one cat needed allergy testing and immunotherapy and an a procedure to remove an ear plug at the dermatologist which were all covered. My other cat eats things a lot and needed several middle of the night emergency visits after we came home to find he had eaten chocolate or garlic flavored jerky or other things. So it's definitely helped a lot when needing to go to clinics outside of my own!"

"Yet people say ""oh a 1070 Ti or 1080 or 1080 Ti can't drive 1440p144 monitors"", but no one ever talks about it being *max settings*, they just assume everyone is jacking all the sliders up to max and not using the greatest advantage of PC gaming which is tuning it to your preferences.

It's a shitty way to be dismissive of everything.

You could say ""these cards will do 144 hz, but you'll have to lower settings"" instead of ""no, these cards will flat out not run 144hz at 1440p wait for RTX 4080 Ti FE Superclocked Omega Edition""."

Another problem is that I see this deck losing to faster decks (merfolk) or decks with some removal but more low cc threats (vampires, pirates). "

What trade needs for balance is some externalities like danger of piracy, potential of saturating markets, or limited supply, so that people moving small quantities of valuable goods have a chance to compete. This should provide a little bit of counter to large hold =&gt; way more profits, when hold sizes currently vary by 100x."

Not sure if it related because I have always been “lazy” Keto but I’m at my goal weight now. (Lost about 40 lbs)"

"Parking ticket is probably not a concern. 

Additionally, I find your wording odd for the school detail. It's not that you were put into cuffs that's worth noting, it's the fact you got into a fight. I personally would disclose that among whatever else. 

The reasoning why is because if you are asking right now if you should or not, you may think you should, but won't because in the back of your head you want the best possible chance to get hired. In reality, if let's say you have a polygraph and the administrator asks something to the effect of ""Is there anything else"", you my give indicators that there are but won't disclose them. That shows deception and the test may have some kinks in it because of that. Be honest, the fight probably won't hold you back."

Title: **Swindled out of $500 by NetSpend**

Original Post: 

&gt; hello,
&gt; 
&gt; recently I purchased a netspend card thinking it was a gift card by accident, I registered the card with fake information initially as they required many information that I thought was excessive, I did not realize that this information would be required in order to access the funds. I entered in a fake name along with a fake social security number, after noticing that it needed to be valid  I called the customer service hotline to reset the information. They told me they couldn't reset the information and that I wouldn't be able to access the funds on the card without providing the required information(fake), despite me saying that I couldn't because it was fake, they told me the information couldn't be updated and after telling my plight to a supervisor he transferred me back to the automated machine which told me the same thing. Is it legal for them to just keep my money because I cant verify the information?

"AI is everywhere and to make advanced prostetics there will need to be intergrated control marrying thoughts and nerves together and aided by AI software for seemeless movement. Thats near future.

The equality of these transhuman, starts with the basic, transexuals. After all if society accepts that gender is a choice, then all notions of what it traditionally thought of as standards for induviduality or what it is to be human can change.

And, well, scifi science comes prepackaged with the help of AI is just a certain future for us.

"In the first Mamma Mia, Streep et. al are also supposed to be characters in their early 40's considering that, in the 2nd one, Streep's character has a baby in the late 70's right out of college, and her daughter gets engaged at 20, meaning her character would've been in her early 40's in the first one, even though they are all (with the exception of Firth) obviously in their 50's. To be fair, most of them haven't aged much since 2008 but they still look more like fiftysomethings than the mid-late fortysomethings they'd be in the sequel. It's even weirder with Julie Walters who, no offense to her, has aged quite a bit since 2008 and yet her character should be in her 40's even by the time of the 2nd one."

"If you pick a ""bad"" fight and you win because of your superior execution and engage tools is it really bad?

It's not necessarily that the general level of play is lower, just that different skills and strategies are rewarded. Those things aren't necessarily easier, or the highly skilled Korean teams would have been able to adapt to them in a similar way that Cloud 9 did after the first round robin."

If you are just beginning, I would suggest taking a look at discrete math, particularly combinatorics, as this seems to come up a lot in algorithms. Graph theory is also a huge thing in programming, but not to the extent that mathematicians go. Probability theory may come up occasionally (markov chains, etc.), but it's rare and the theory that's most used will be covered in any intro discrete math course. 

Even if you aren't a math wiz, the good news is that libraries exist in pretty much every language that can do most of the heavy lifting for you. While you don't have to implement the math yourself, it's still good to know the math behind each algorithm so you understand their limitations."

"Late reply, I know. I thought this too but a friend gave me a new perspective when I brought it up to them. The light can be bent however the user chooses so there's no need to have supers thematically tied together. Also when you look at warp and trance they are extremely similar and can be easily compared, more so when they are the same element. On top of all that too when 2 similar supers are in the same slot it's going to lead to a lot of comparisons, eg why would you ever use stormtrance over an arc version of warp? At least now there's a few minor reasons to do so eg element singe, different grenades etc."

"Wilcox’s Apothecary 

Dry Woods, Fresh Herbs, Dried Herbs, Warm Woody Spices, Sweet Annie, Sage, Rosewood

Dr. Wilcox's Apothercary is housed in an old cottage within the town of Foxcroft. She has a cottage garden full of fresh grown herbs that she processes into various tinctures and tissanes. Wilcox's is a very herbal blend featuring dry woods, sage, rosemary, lavender, chamomile, dry woody spice (think fresh grated nutmeg), mugwort, sweet annie, hay, holy basil and more. It contains a variety of woods including cypress and cedar. Wilcox's is a cousin to our popular Witch's Cottage fragrance, which also has warm woods and herbs. Wilcox's is more herbal and does not contain the fruit and pastry gourmand notes. It is very cozy. Opens with a blend of woods and fresh rubbed herbs from running your hands in the cottage garden. After a few minutes, the warm, cozy interior of the apothecary begins to emerge focusing on the wood and evolving the dry spices aspect."

"&gt;reply to u/obit33 who deleted their post.

Hey!

&gt;don't you think this now has gone on long enough

What's gone on long enough? All the feedback I'm getting from the thread, with the exception of your community, is EXTREMELY positive. People are thanking me for helping make things clearer for them. 

&gt;it's a clear offer, and refusing it would speak volumes about your real intentions.

Lol no it wouldn't. I don't have to debate anyone, especially not someone who acts in bad faith. Why should I debate someone who shadow deletes threads, and lies about other projects? What benefit does that serve? What would be gained by a private debate? I want to get a conversation started, not test my intellect.

&gt;If your intention is to truely promote privacy and anonimity and cryptocurrency, I think you should really take this offer.

False dichotomy, strawman. I don't think I've ever stated I inted to 'promote privacy and anonymity'. The privacy aspect of Dash is a useful aspect to me, but its far from the only thing I love about it, and its not the reason I post. My ONLY REAL purpose in posting is to counter the FUD and lies that originated from people like you, and the person offering me to debate. You guys started your lies here, so why shouldn't they die here? The fact is you guys have been lying about Dash and privacy for like 4 years now. Don't **_*you*_** think this has gone on long enough?

&gt;If your intention is to stir up drama, to FUD, to promote your very own version of the truth, then you'll walk away, but then it will be clear to everyone what it is you are up to....

You sure are using heavy-handed tactics in order to push this idea...But how can you claim I'm the one trying to stir up drama? How many countless FUD threads have you created like this one:

"Arlan shook his head silently. *Fucking Anise.* 

""Yes, yes. Of course. You're the noble victim, the one who's been unfairly excoriated. Because I'm *sure* you didn't do such a horrid thing as murder. Why, it's a fine and likely consideration that all your adversaries coincidentally gathered in one building, one evening, inadvertently trapped themselves inside, and burned alive by *accident*,"" he spat.

""I never told Anise you were trying to undermine me, you know. I merely speculated in passing that you might have motive to do so. Nothing more. It's not my responsibility if she's taken on a penchant for... embellishment.""

Whether he was deliberately playing the fool or not, Aurion didn't seem to grasp the weight of their circumstances. Arlan let the silence hang for a moment as he rose from his seat, pacing towards the window and staring pensively out to the square in front of the Dragon Gate. ""There's something else afoot here, whether you choose to recognize it or not. You make all these claims about what gaps I fill in with my own biased contrivances, and yet you do the same. You want to think that I devote so much time and effort to vilifying you, when the simple truth is that I don't wholly trust you. You have never given me any reasons to do so.""

""I'm to take you to the Master of Laws. Actually, Robert was supposed to, but I hear he was plenty eager to let you roam on in without issue. Lord Dayne wishes to discuss your path into the Hand's service. So it would be wise to not pretend anymore. We all know that only *you* had the purview, motive, and means to burn... whoever the fuck it was that you burned that night. And with that man, honesty is the only chance you'll have at forgiveness.""

""In case you haven't heard, my brother was murdered here, within the city. In one of Robert's districts, no less. Just like two other no-name corpses that he has refused to share any details about."" He turned his gaze back to the Volantene. ""If you want to avoid suspicion for those, it would be best if you told Gerold the *whole truth* of the night of the fire. That way, at least you might be able to show him that you kill for retaliation, retribution. Not for bloodlust, *petty* vengeance, or mere ambition."" He wondered if the man understood his implicit suggestions. If his soggy simpleton persona would wash away when he caught the scent of intrigue once again. But either way, he was prepared."

É uma conexão entre duas almas. Não importa se entre homem e homem, homem e animal (me lembro de Christian, o leão, e de Dindim, o penguim), ou homem e espírito. Uma amizade é o que divide as dores e multiplica as alegrias.

Que vc e seu amigo se reencontrem sempre!

Yet, nobody here would ever attack someone for being Catholic, the fucking Pope is even popular on reddit despite him not doing shit about the child rape issues, even blaming victims. E.g.

"You’re getting a lot of shit here, unfairly in my view. My husband has stage 4 cancer, I’m his carer. As a result, we spend a lot of time in the company of cancer patients, of all types, during chemo, at hospital, and at MacMillan events.

No two cancer patients are alike. Everyone is different. My husband and my friend’s husband both have the same cancer and have had the same chemo. On cycle day 2 my friend’s husband would be bedridden, on day 2 my husband would be up and about. He’s no stronger than the other guy, just their bodies process it differently. My husband is 3 years into treatment and has had 4 different rounds of chemo, and hasn’t lost his hair. On his last chemo he put on 10kg owing to steroids and certainly didn’t look gaunt. I know several people who’ve run marathons while having chemo. I also know people who have been hospitalised after 1 cycle as their body can’t tolerate it.

If I had to hazard a guess, it would be that doctors would not want Roman to risk injury in a match as they’d want him to retain his strength, and thus his immune system, for treatment. But that’s a guess.

There’s no one specific thing that cancer looks like. There’s also no one specific treatment. The truth is nobody except Roman, his doctors, and those closest to him, will know what cancer is for him."

"Well yes, while Rowling’s word is for the most part law, some laws can be broken. The books themselves are unbreakable. Let’s take it to the extreme. Let’s say Rowling tomorrow says “Harry Potter was a girl all along.” We would know this to be completely and utterly impossible, it doesent matter how hard she tries to apply her “godlike” powers over her series. There are some things she simply can not touch because they completely disregard everything we know is explicitly stated in the books. If she someday decides that “Voldemort never actually killed anybody” we would know this to be untrue, and could completely disregard this fact. Now obviously these are extreme examples, but they are extreme to prove my point. There are some things that just can’t be reversed, changed, or switched up. Now I don’t have a problem with Hermione being black for a play, but it doesent matter how hard she tries, Rowling can not snap her fingers and change her cannon ethnicity as this would completely shatter actual wording of the books she wrote. She is white, end of. Rowling can say what she likes. 

What an author CAN do is what we call a retcon. If someday she rewrites the books, she could change whatever she wants, print out the new copies, and then banish the previous works to be standalones separate of the MAIN story. If she does this, yeah she could do whatever she wants. 

TL,DR, an authors words are much more powerful than the author themselves. Something’s can’t be changed. "

I'm basing that off of what happened OTL. The Great Depression was a demand crisis, and classical economics at the time was failing to explain or resolve it. The faster a country abandoned tight monetary policy and austerity, the faster it recovered from OTL Great Depression. Stimulus is the agreed on solution from post-depression economics, and the US right wing at the time were still deficit hawks and perhaps triggered the 1937 double dip with the requirement for balanced budget."

"Alright so I finally got the update.

This is absolutely a beta release. I tried it with my iPhone X and resolution is terrible. (Blurry just looking at the iPhone screen) Then I mirrored my phone to my tv and, well - no one is going to be doing this. It's a blurry mess at anything bigger than phone size.

Setup does work smoothly, but guys - we may be pushing the hardware here. This very well might be what we're looking at with mirroring on the Go without causing slowdowns. I can't see any other way to push this out to the public. I suspect a lot of people are going to be disappointed.

Based on my observations - we're looking at 5-15 FPS at (wild guess here) 720p resolution with a lot of compression artifacts. Might even be half that scaled to 720p - that's how it looks to me. Things are blocky, there's maybe 1-2 seconds of lag on top of that.

I'm running a 5G network that can stream Steam at a full 1080p without any issues at all. Nothing was using any bandwidth while I tested.

If you look at this for what it is, it's a way to ""peek"" into the Go without dawning the headset. It is not like the Rift - you are not going to get a clear/fast video feed of what's going on. Personally I'm disappointed, but not wildly so."

"I have so many cute as fuck $20 purses that i love to use on occasion, but i know i cant use it all the time because it will fall apart.  The rubber edging the fake leather will peel.  Then the stitching will start to fray.  The fake leather will start to peel from its favric backing.  Maybe the zipper will get fucked, maybe a strap will break, but one way or another those purses have never lasted more than a month of every day use.  Im 22 and the coach purse i got when i turned 13 just broke a few months ago.  It was phenomenal.  All the straps were riveted into the patent leather as opposed to just stitched in.  The stitching was all quality, and was only a little frayed in places at the end of its lifespan.  What eventually broke was the fabric next to the zipper.  I have no problem spending $200-300 on a quality purse that i can actually use every day.  Nothing is quite as mildly annoying as having a purse strap break in the middle of an outing, especially if it was a really cute purse."

It feels like we're on that sort of 1960s precipice regarding a lot of the same social issues. 

It's hard for me to consider this as ""worse"" than other political times from when I've been alive. Affer 9/11, things felt so... Up in the air.

I think anytime people feel like they're not in control of their lives, things get way more heated. People feel threatened, and they'll forget everything else in order to make sure they feel safe again. No matter what side you're on, I think that's where all the emotion comes from.

"&gt;He's put up huge TD numbers in the past, with Eli at the helm who also wasn't great back then

In 2014, 2015 and 2016 Manning threw for 30, 35 and 26 TDs. 

2017 Manning threw for 19. This season he's on pace for just 16. 

&gt;and I think Saquon offsets that difference in terms of how the offense moves the ball

I don't really know what you mean by this, but I'd argue that having a monster in Saquon will certainly hurt OBJ's TD numbers. 

Of course he's still going to have big play opportunities, but I don't think you can argue that a team who has been terrible offensively through 7 games is suddenly going just because of past numbers.

"Dude. Ever hear about occam's razor? The simplest solution is likely the correct one. Applying that to the potential bomber, the targets were all democrats or in the case of Brennan/CNN people and organizations targeted by Trump. The obvious answer is that some crazy bastard drank too much of trump's hater-aid and decided to send bombs to targets of Trump's ire. 

Sure, the dems might actually get a bit of an electoral bump based on the outrage over these acts of political terrorism, but a false flag attack, especially one paid for by the dems as you have insinuated, requires a pretty large conspiracy and assuming the FBI was correct in stating that, at least the bomb sent to Brennan, was a live and active bomb, there was a legitimate possibility of death from these bombs. No democratic party leader would involve themselves in this sort of crazy plan. 

The downside for them is just way too large. Sending a lot of bombs at the same time is a risky proposition and the bomber will likely get identified and caught within a week or so. Should it prove to be a false flag, it will cause much more damage to the party that the possible bump they could get out of such an act. There is no real upside for the democratic party to have done this."

"I should clarify that what I meant was: I had interpreted the derivative as meaning that if we measure a temperature, then we are measuring a change in entropy with respect to internal energy. Alternatively, if we take the integral of the partial derivative with respect to internal energy, wouldn't we find that a change in entropy is related to the temperature?

I was imagining, as an example, a closed system consisting of a container of water, and a battery pack that powers both a heater and a cooling-type-thing inside the container. We then run a Carnot cycle of whatever we choose with our system. Since the internal energy doesn't change, but we know by intuition that the temperature of the water should be changing and then going back to the original, and that the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy cannot decrease through time, I was thinking that entropy in our system has to somehow increase after all is done."

"Arcade Disney Crossy Road's score to beat increases with how much the player scores at the end. That, and what Mewtwo said - the scroll speed.

It's a 250 jackpot and a 0.7 hop/ticket ratio, unless you have a location that isn't aligned with global settings.
&amp;nbsp;

Regular Arcade Crossy Road is different, as it's easier to play through without having to select stuff. The difficulty kinda works differently in this original version. Instead of scroll speed, the game throws tight packs or trucks and car patterns if it's hit too much. End up with the wrong patterns, and death will be on the doorstep. The score to be isn't effected by any daily high score, so it's easier to farm. With a 250 bonus and a 0.7 hop/ticket rate globally, it isn't that good. That is, unless you want the all time high score."

"it's definitely not going to be easy to refund if you sold any card.

If you think ""they won't let you refund if you *open* the packs"" then i am afraid to tell you that shit won't fly in Europe.

if you think that would mean ""you could just open the 10 packs and ask for a refund if you didn't open 40$ worth of cards"" then think again: Valve wants people to play games, not to get played themselves.They could stop you from purchasing artifact again shortly after or even anything with the same credit card or account for a few days.Perhaps you'll find a way to do it *once*.

 i heard they sometimes have stopped purchases from a credit card for 3 days after a refund, but i am gonna need someone else to confirm it."

"Did anyone really consider 2013 a down year for him?  I wasn’t trying to be pedantic by saying that it was actually .854 instead of .860.  I was trying to point out that in his “down” year his OPS was actually much lower than .860.

I guess I can see why people thought that but that’s not at all what I was trying to say.

He’s had 2 worse years since then and he was only 20 (not to mention it was one of his better years overall), it makes no sense to call 2013 his down year.

I assumed he was talking about 2016 and got his OPS wrong, which is what I was trying to correct.

Also even if that was what I was trying to correct it still makes no sense to round .854 to .860 instead of .850 lol.

The guy even edited his post to say he got the OPS wrong lol."

"Kaya carried his coffee to the training grounds. He’d been antsy ever since the fight outside Hoshi Suuhai HQ. He knew logically that he’d done his best and damn near collapsed from exhaustion afterwards but there was a voice in the back of his mind telling him that he could have done more, could have helped more. It whispered about how easily the attackers had dodged his attacks, barely deigning to pay him any attention once they’d seen him in action.

It was that voice that drove him to the training grounds. Where once he’d dreaded coming here, dreaded showing people that he worked hard at his techniques, that it didn’t all come naturally to him, now he was eager for it. On one level it felt like penance for failing, on another it felt like a promise, a public declaration that he **would** get stronger, **would** get faster, until no one could stand up to his speed and strength. He came there every day now, mostly training alone but doing the occasional spar. 

Arriving just as he finished his coffee, Kaya set his mug off to the side with the rest of his stuff and noticed Kaferee also there to train. She was carrying tea and a bagel and he wondered if she’d be up for a little spar when she’d finished breakfast. Fighting another lightning user was interesting and he was curious what new techniques she’d developed since they’d last clashed. “Hey Kaf, good morning!” He called out and waved to her. He’d ask her about sparring after they’d gotten the pleasantries out of the way."

"American inability to think beyond terms of body counts is exactly why you guys got kicked out of Vietnam. Battles that command thought they had won were actually being lost, as Giap's battleplans never revolved around getting a higher bodycount than the Americans. You're making the exact same mistake with this comment, the insurgents are not playing by your rules. Their goals are to maximize costs upon the united states, be these costs physical, financial, or even just taking up space in the American political discourse. And remember, a homegrown insurgency doesn't need to ""win"", their victory condition is to *not lose*. In this sense, they absolutely kicked the shit out of the United States and you *did* run home with your tails between your legs, just like Vietnam.

Andrew Mack's ""Why big nations lose small wars"" explains this far better than I can, give it a read."
"It's obviously both. A huge part is brand. A People wanna feel better than others so they buy nice cars and they couldn't tell you at all how the cars are better. They are made better but that doesn't justify the entire cost and I'm pretty sure that's the case for Apple products too. Especially their phones when you consider they turn to shit after 3-4 years at most and they expect the customers to get bored of it by two years.

Having said that, if you don't think the comedian is funny, you're probably going to have a bad time."

"It can totally work. I married my now husband after 4 years of dating, and I totally felt the same feelings you felt. I too, have no kids of my own, and have no desire to have my own kids. It’s just a matter of how you think you can cope with the feelings that you feel at this very moment in the long run. In the beginning, I felt the same things as you and almost 5 years later, it hasn’t changed much, I just learned to cope with it better. I remember I was about a year into dating my husband, we were living together, he was at work, and I sitting on the couch staring at the wall while my SD 7 at the time, threw a tantrum because I didn’t get her a toy on amazon...lol! Yeah, I don’t miss those days AT ALL. Anyways, my stepkids are older now, they’re amazing, wonderful, well behaved...but can still be a lot of work sometimes...it’s just a different form than when they were younger. In all honestly, even the most well behaved stepkids are a lot of work, especially for steps like us who never had a desire to have kids, and don’t have kids of our own. I’ve also learned to take care of my own wants and needs better too. Like if I need a weekend away with my girlfriends, I take one. If I need to be alone after dinner, I go to my room and close the door. I also communicate with my husband if I am frustrated over something regarding the kids and thankfully, he is very receptive to my feelings and totally understands. That’s a rare occurrence, but it helps knowing that he supports me and he understands how hard it is for me sometimes. 

One thing that has helped me a lot is this sub. I’ve been a lurker for years. I also stopped talking about my feelings to parents who have their own kids because quite honestly, most of them don’t understand where we are coming from, and they make me feel guilty about my feelings. Anyways, I’m sure you know what’s best deep inside your heart. Just know that you are not alone! Xoxo "

"I don't know how big of a collection you have or you plan to have so I can't really say, but in my opinion you should ALWAYS buy during big sales. 

RightStuf has probably the best sale of all stores during Christmas (whole month of December) and a very good sale during summer (month of July). If you wait for these sales and buy a big bulk of 250$ USD you will end up saving a bunch of money. I guess what I'm trying to say is that buying 250$ USD once a year on RightStuf would make you end up with a lot more manga than buying multiple times on any other website.

Although recently I have been keeping track of Indigo sales and some are very very great. There are multiple combination of sales possible. Every week there is a different graphic novel sale, once in a while you can get a bonus plum points promo and you can always have 10% off 50$+ by using the Honey Chrome App or searching for the coupon code on google. You save up on taxes so another 10% off. 

During the right sales, Indigo definitely surpasses RightStuf, but RightStuf has the lowest prices of any website. NEVER EVER buy a book full price on Indigo, the prices are high as hell.

edit: If you like to see numbers, you can read one of my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeDeals/comments/9kn27e/canadian_customers_indigo_has_one_of_the_best/) where I talked about the Indigo sale a couple weeks ago "

"Hmmmmm

I don't understand that mantra passive change, not feeling rewarded for playing agressively is quite a pain in the ass to be fair. Whether i'm playing support or mid lane, i (and some other dedicated Karma players i like to watch) tend to look at trading as often as possible, and if it's a playstyle that is somewhat discouraged with these changes i think you're looking at it the wrong way.

It reminds me of when you (the balance team) were hesitating between reducing Azir's playmaking potential and reducing his ""marksman"" efficiency through high range. You decided to keep intact his shurima shuffle combo and forced him to interact more with ennemies through reduced range on soldiers.

I also remember the way Aphromoo played Karma in soloQ while in her prime : staying stacked with the team, waiting for the best opportunity to mantra E without getting involved with the ennemies beside slowing them down when they were coming at him. He absolutely didnt exploit her passive and i found that was a very very lame way to play her.

My ennemies don't like the safe Karma that pokes them without any way to counterattack, the way she seems untouchable. I don't like to be idle in lane and just poke when they're coming to CS, i don't like to have to poke for 1 billion years before i can step up to a thresh or leona. I like to W offensively and try to land a full mantra Q on them before retreating if i can't score a kill. I really am thirsty for plays and lane crush on the opponent, an attitude that is supported by the way the current passive works. And if it's not the case anymore then this is not my Karma either. She's not Nami, Sona, Soraka, those support who advocate to play with patience and just outsustain their opponents over time. I'm here with her to actually stand right in the middle of the lane and look for agressions along with my carry. To me, the thing that makes her distinct from the others is being the most offensive enchanter in the game, the only one you consistently buy an Athenes on due to how well she synergises with it. And she should get utility rewards for that playstyle like this item does. 

I actually like the intent on W for this aspect, but CDR doesn't help all marksmen with the same efficiency (eg. almost useless for Draven and Kalista). I guess it doesn't have to anyway, even an enchanter can't fit perfectly with everyone, this is already neat like this.

That's all i had to say right now."

If you have a beefy PC now I think you'll be fine for release. Thanks to Object Container Streaming the game loads only what it needs to into memory, instead of the entire universe as it previously did. The only areas where even high end PCs will still struggle are areas with a lot of object containers that the game has to load like a crowded city or a giant battle between many ships. Further optimizations should help (the switch to Vulkan should be another big one), so I don't think your current rig will run it poorly when it's released. It's just that a more modern PC by the time it's released will run it better."

"A big chunk of the sub seems to buy into the “Give the HC 3 years to show stability” argument.  Whether Hue is underperforming or not, to make the HC position attractive to top candidates we should give Hue the benefit of 3 full years as a signal to the HC market.  As a counter to Jimmy’s past knee jerk firings, basically.

I’m not a part of that crowd, I wanted Hue chucked before drafting the QB of the future, but at this point it makes sense to stick to the cadence of making moves in the offseason.  You won’t be able to interview pro candidates until then, anyway.

So if they are trying to improve Jimmy’s image as an owner, Hue will be the HC all season long no matter what."

"I never had a dog as a kid, but I used to read this series when I was a kid named *Hank the Cowdog*. It's from the dog's point of view, and he says he's ""Head of Ranch Security"" and he has various responsibilities including ""warning barks"" to any vehicle that approaches the ranch unauthorized. 

Anyway, he says that every time the owners give him a bath, he says to restore his manliness by bathing in the green lake, which is basically the septic tank's overflow in the form of a big green puddle. So after he bathes in that stinky puddle of shit, he is once again ""covered in manly scents"""

 Assuming gravity is the independent variable, heart lifespan is the dependent, and all other variables are controlled for (diet, exercise, etc.) its interesting to think that the heart could last far longer on another planet.

"&gt;The manager acknowledges that the place is hard to find and ask for the address I was given. 

They already know that the headhunter is giving out the wrong address, or they wouldn't ask you that.  I've never had anyone ask that question of me in an interview.

&gt;I constantly receive directions for one thing but then am later told to do something else after I've acted on the first set of instructions. My boss mentions that I should double check with her and it my fault for not confirming. 

Start asking for all instructions in writing.  Email, handwritten on the back of an envelope...  whatever.  But they should have the presence of mind to know exactly what it is that they are telling you to do.

So in the first case, you are good.  In the second case, you have a shitty manager.  That one is on her, and not on you."

Nic Tutt is a good student. He excels at all subjects. But his education serves only one purpose—to gain entry into the Ransom School.   
Ransom is the most prestigious school in the country. Its alumni are destined to become the future leaders of Ranvar. Politicians, statesemen and, in some exceptional cases, mages. Only the brightest and the best get into Ransom.  
But Nic doesn't care about any of that. He isn't determined to get into Ransom to further his prospects or better his career opportunities. He has another reason to want to enter Ranvar's most famous school.

"Get in touch with old friends. 

I was feeling down and out the past few days and decided to text one of my friends out of the blue (we'll call him John).

John ended up inviting me to go out with himself, his brother and a few other mutual friends to a birthday party at a bar downtown. I begrudgingly went even though I was nervous as all hell. I realized that I had a lot more in common with these people than I thought and am going to be going to a concert with all of them this weekend and in a few weeks we're going to an NFL game together (my work is sponsoring the event). 

I guess my main advice is to muster up what little bit of confidence and ambition that you have and just go for it. You'll never know what could happen.

"Thanks for getting back and creating the doodle. I am suprised that your observations re the perfect shot appear to be true. Additionally that the same method could be applied to great and good shots as well. Here is why: Clubs with very low accuracy and on max club have a relatively large bullseye. Accuracy 0 should correspond to 3 mph per ring. This would result in a buffer zone of 6 mph to hit a perfect shot! That would be a huge variation in my eyes! I cannot believe that programmers would just allow on pixel to be hit within a 6 mph zone... Obviously if shooting with a wedge on min distance I could understand that the programmers would set only a few iterations for perfect, since the deviation would be very little to insignificant for the outcome. 

In real life the hitting point would basically have infinite possibilities. Programmers however will have to use a method that most likely is not infinite but uses pre-set iterations or steps. Meaning that releasing the needle at point x will have the effect y on the landing postion of the ball. I assume a numbers table works this out in the back ground. This cannot be infinite. I believe though with regard to the above example that a lower graduation of iterations needs to be applied than just having one pixel in a 6 mph buffer zone for a perfect shot. 

The bullseye consists of 10 rings. Let's say this comes down to 100 pixels on an iphone 8 for example. So we have 10 pixels per ring. With your observation it does not matter wheter I hit the 10th pixel to the left or the 10th pixel to the right of pixel 50, my shot will result as a shot hit on pixel 50. when hitting a great shot, which correspond to 2 rings pixel 21 to 40 on the left and 61 to 80 to the right, you assume we just get a shot as maybe hit on 25 or 35 or on the right 65 and 75? That would mean programmers use a numbers table which says, when realeasing the needle at pixel:

0-10: ball lands in a (good left)

11-20: ball lands in b (good left)

21-30: ball lands in c (great left)

31-40: ball lands in d (great left)

41-60: ball lands in e (perfect shot as hit in pixel 50)

61-70: ball lands  in f (great right)

71-80: ball lands in g (great right)

81-90: ball lands in h (good right)

91-100: ball lands in i (good right)

Does the game use different number tables for different device resolutions? Obviously the graduation to the release point of the needle cannot be finer than one pixel... I find this a very interesting topic. Actually the same should apply for over and underpowering shots. Thanks for bringing this up Mang!"

"Yes, I feel the same way. Although as time has gone on, and I have more obligations (things that I WANT to do and accomplish) I believe that I have developed a bit of a ""mental alarm"". I was 15 when Vanilla WoW was in its prime, and I got progressively more hardcore in TBC. Highschool student, no job, no girlfriend, no obligations to run from. Though I did feel a social guilt by playing WoW so much. My friends would ask me why I disappear for months at a time, then show up again or 2 weeks (during times I'd try to quit) then disappear again.

Quitting WoW at the start of WotLK was easy for me. I didn't like that the effort and time I put in reset with another xpac, and the guilt that I felt of abandoning a social life entirely finally set in. I believe that time started a drastic shift in my maturation and perspective on gaming.

Now, at 28 with ""responsibilities"" and goals that I genuinely wish to accomplish in life, my fire still burns hot. But it burns so hot, that it burns out quickly. I find myself getting obsessed with things easily, but it never lasts long. When I game for too long, a guilty mental alarm goes off and I put it down. I've seen where running from responsibility got me, and I will not let that happen again.

So when Classic comes out, will I obsess over it? Absolutely, for a brief period. Nothing lasts forever, and I always strive to live in the moment. My suggestion for you is that enjoy your experiences, build on the inspiration these experiences give, and that ""Guilt"" you feel in the back of your mind that signals that you may be over-doing it? Listen to it. Play the game, and enjoy it, but when you feel that go off step away and look forward to the next time that you get to play. You'll enjoy your play time much more and will feel good about managing to take care of your self and others in the process."

"&gt; Redguard is without a doubt the best race, as for class that is debatable if you want to be as strong as possible in WW then Sorcerer or templar.


They are a solid choice, but not the best at all. 

In PVP, the best is without question argonian because they get more than a 20% buff to the WW heal, great mag and stam sustain, and resistance to disease. 

In PVE, Orcs, Khajit, or imperial are all going to be better options IMO, but Orcs are objectively better since all WW damage is melee. The redguard sustain passives don't really help WW dps, so all you get from them is 10% max stam, which makes them 4th best. 

&gt; Warden makes the weakest WW so probably not a good idea

Honestly, all classes are pretty balanced when it comes to WW. They all have really strong upside.


Sorc - Great sustain passives and implosion makes them a great option for PVE WW. Sorc is probably the only class that has a net advantage over the rest. 

Templar - Templar WWs have the best stats but there are two huge downsides to them that you can't really appreciate until you've made one. First, the ideal CP distribution for a WW and a Stamplar are as far from one another as either is from that of a MagSorc. WW needs massive points in Physical weapons expert and Master at Arms, and almost nothing in thaumaturge. Stamplar is all about thauma and mighty.


The second drawback is PVP centric and its the fact that there isn't really anything gained strategically by going WW as a Stamplar, because WWs and STamplars basically do the exact same thing: they get in your face with lots of pressure. With other classes, going WW is a way to totally change your attack methods and thus improve against the classes that soft-counter them. 

Warden- Best WW healing, reduced snares, super fast ulti generation, minor toughness 100% of the time, and a CP distribution that fits WW like a glove. You can maximize your damage in both human and wolf form as a warden, and that's huge. 


Nightblade- Fewest drawbacks, but not that many pros to going NB either. It works well as a burst option, but isn't ideal for permawolfing, though CP distribution is pretty close in both forms. The toughest WW I've ever faced 1v1 though was a NB, so it's not a bad option, just not an obvious one.


DK- This used to be the hands down worst option but that changed this past patch when DKs were given the strongest passive in WW form by far: increased melee range. Aside from that, you get defensive passives and the transformation becomes a massive burst heal, but that's about it.  "

"&gt;dozens and dozens of threads of you with half truths, 

No. Dozens and dozens of threads of you ACCUSING ME of half truths. But you've never actually shown I was saying anything false. In fact, you always use accusations like that as a way to shut down discussion instead of actually discussing.

&gt;accusations and what not vs one thread by a xmr-community-member about the instamine of dash which is factual

First of all, its not one thread. There was a guy in Africa educating a room of kids about Dash and you guys had the nerve to say he was brainwashing them instead! Looks like they deleted the thread eventually, but that was pretty low. And then there was this thread:

https://imgur.com/a/UJjIhiE

Where you try to call the founder of Dash sleazy and a liar. Evan Duffield has actually won AWARDS for his integrity. I didn't even know such a thing existed, but that's the guy you chose to smear. Honestly, my only question is, what is wrong with you guys?

&gt;you're not debatable, you live in your own reality... 

What are you talking about? I have consistently proven to change my opinion and argument based on **factual** information. The OP that you guys want to get rid of so badly originally had Dash above ZCoin (which I mislabeled ZeroCoin, several times). u/turtleflax corrected me on some PIVX info and on some ZeroCoin protocol info in general. I didn't even have ZEC in the original list. But measured, direct, logical feedback from various users made me change it. So you're LYING when you say I'm not debatable. What you mean is I'm not susceptible to whatever tactics you're using to manipulate narratives.

Says this:
&gt;i'm not being aggressive, 

Then follows up with vague, aggressive threat:
&gt;It's been offered to you, you decide to decline and keep up this act of yours...

Yeah sure you're not. The only thing you're convincing me of is that you are a bad actor.

"I really have mixed feelings about Jack, mostly from a storywritting perspective. He is like a mixture between that monstruous 1B guy who fights everyone head-on and doesn't fear anyone and with insane endurability, but is eating one loss after the other.

Like, there are many ways to hype up and introduce characters. For instance he could have low-diffed some 300m guy or easily beaten a 500m guy. He definitely has shown some feats no doubt. But on the other hand, he also didn't really defeat anyone in the story other than unnamed fodder. He went to Wano where he stalled with Neko/Inu and then pulled back to use Caesar gas to beat them. Then he went to fight Fujitora and Sengoku where he took a beating. Then he went back to Zou to get smashed by Zunisha. Then he got to Wano and didn't look too good either against Shuitenmaru and will probably stop fighting him to follow Kaido's order and focus on locating them for him.

See where I am going with this? He is really that odd mixture of a guy who is known to be tough and strong but we all see being beaten again further down the road anyways.

At the brink of the battle he was struck in the neck with an arrow, and fearing the battle would be lost without his leadership he instructed his son to take his armor and outfit and beat the war drum and to not let the military know about his death until after the war was over.

"I think the key here is ""minimal functionality"". Looking at the app on Google Play, it really doesn't do much more than show a mapView with no interaction. Apple will see this as something that can be easily done with a web page, it doesn't matter if your app is using a webView or not. It needs something that makes it an app. It needs to do something. Perhaps showing something when people tap a pin, it offers some interactivity.

Google's standards for what can go in an app is much more lenient than Apple. Simply add some functionality to the app and maybe that will be enough to give Apple a reason to pass the app instead of fail it.

"Well, at least unlike most Fat Logicians, this cartoon acknowledges that eating poorly and not getting any exercise (ie being overweight) will likely shorten life expectancy. 

I do agree with others who have said that if we’re talking about weight and weight loss, exercise is a crappy way to do it. In my personal experience I’d say exercise counted for maybe 20% of my weight loss, max. At 320 lbs I used to get winded walking a few blocks. No way I was going to be able to get any meaningful exercise until I fixed my eating habits and the pounds started coming off. I used to think exercising gave me more energy but looking back I think the energy came from not having to haul around an extra 100 lbs of body fat."

"When I initially completed Kinny registration earlier today, I completed 2 surveys back-to-back for which I was screened out for both and was awarded 10 for each as expected.  App then said ""check back tomorrow for more great opportunities"".  So I just opened the app again (approx 4hrs later) and it went staight into a poll fish survey, completed it, boom rewarded 130 Kin.  I checked market page, still says ""check back tomorrow..."", I then went to another app, came back to Kinny app and was auto prompted with another survey.  So not sure if the poll fish surveys can show up any time and not sure if they should just pop up without hitting any button.  Perhaps, when you guys changed the settings on the back end to eliminate 3rd party apps, it resets the waiting period for users? Note: the app was never forced closed it was always just minimized among the other apps. 
The app is awesome by the way! Really like the UI and app flow. Shining star of the currently available Kin apps."

Human being number 1 has not been wronged but somehow feels that he should be able to lock human being in a cage and take away his basic human rights, all because he is in possession of a plant.

I'm not interested in the ""helping"" aspect of the government/candidate. Reducing the size of government generally involves stopping ""this or that"" because ""this or that"" generally involves expanding the governments ability to exert control over something. "

If that were the case, I'd be hyping the ad instead.  ""$450 for this set is a *steal*!""

I can find equitable specimens of the Schneider in a Copal 1 shutter on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Schneider-Kreuznach-Symmar-S-180mm-f-5-6-Large-Format-Lens-with-Copal-1-Shutter-/232799333192) for $180.  This would mean that Justin thinks a **used** Mk. 2, 5 holders and a developing tank are worth $495.

A **new** Mk.3 Intrepid is $325, that lens and shutter on eBay is $180, figure $50 for the holders, $40 for the tank, and $50 for all S/H and you get **$645**, plus the eBay buyer's guarantee if a buyer gets that lens off eBay.  Does Justin offer a guarantee?

Do you think Justin's asking price is reasonable, given the prices I just posted, or should Justin rethink his asking price?"

And what this says, at root, beyond beautiful words, is this: existence is messy, there is no transcendence, this life is what really matters, we can't know anything, also anthropology. A rather good crystallization of modern existential despair if I've ever seen one, just married to a DIY spiritual practice. It passes as wisdom for gullible people. How can it not? After all, the person who utters those words studies all those sophisticated disciplines (which point to objective truths, obviously) and, unlike the majority of us rabble, fully engages in the supreme complexity and nebulosity that is life, and his words are always helpful.

It's a good thing that critical thinking shows that critical thought itself does not correlate with being right though."

First, who is talking about sexual harassment?  

Second, the president of the united states has officially said its okay to grab women by the pussy without their consent.  Are we really ones to judge?

Third, need I remind you that western civilization gave birth to the roman catholic church and is thus responsible for thousands of children being molested.  Again, are we really ones to judge?g

Fourth you MAY be right about violence, but without knowing what country these people are from then this is just wild speculation.

&gt; They aren't necessarily bad people, but it's possible that there are factors that would make them more difficult to integrate depending on where they came from.

Fully agree here.  If people speak to specific countries and specific instances, I'm all for having an honest conversation.  There are absolutely some countries that have a culture that is in many ways incompatible with the United States, and folk from those countries require special care - perhaps we limit visas, perhaps we require cultural acclimatization courses, etc.  I'm only against talking about immigrants in BROAD strokes.

&gt;  All people are capable of doing horrible things but nurture can make populations quite different statistically.

Agreed, but when we are talking in broad strokes, statements against ""immigrants"" generally speaking are just ignorant.  You can say immigrants commit X more crime, but that really depends on where the immigrants come from ... plus, why focus on that crime and not the other crime that americans (or europeans) commit more of.  Again, happy to debate specifics, but won't abide by general statements.

&gt; I don't know how easily this could be remedied but it does seem like there's more to it than just ""every person is the same"". That's just not true.

True and not true.  My statement was more based on GENERAL assertions.  You can't say immigrants are more violent than citizens without adding specifics. ONCE specifics are added, then the statement ""every person is the same"" may or absolutely may not be true.

I spent an hour with these people and concluded that they are a scam.  The user was /u/cindy_coinbase_Staff.  They started off sounding legitimate, but after telling them my name and basic stuff they wanted me to go to [fastsupport.com](https://fastsupport.com), which is not run by Coinbase.  They asked me to run an executable file and grant permission to control the computer.

I told them that they needed to send me an E-Mail from an address at [coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com), with a valid DKIM signature, before I would talk further with them.  They didn't do that.

It's a shame that Coinbase's support is so bad that these criminals are able to convince people they are Coinbase.  If Coinbase responded to their support tickets, it is almost certain that these scams would be much less likely to fool people."

"Hmm to be honest, I am attracted to older guys than me as I never saw the attractiveness of boyish guys around the 18-21 mark. My bf is 29 and has a ripped body even though he is essentially bald, beautiful green blue eyes, sexy body hair.

So I look at him and feel a bit inferior and its fucked with my head at times throughout these 7 months. But it also motivated me to get in better shape, which I was doing anyway this year. I am 24 and I notice I get more of the eyes when we walk down the street so I guess the hair and 5 years makes a big difference in the gay world. So I don't feel too bad anymore.

"I don't think ""billings"" refers to Creative's billable hours. When Paul explains the system to Peggy in the first season, he says, ""Creative is just window dressing that's thrown in for free.""

As I understand it, what they bill clients for are all their expenses, mostly the cost of buying ad space, with the their profits coming from the markup -- billing the client more than the media outlets charge the agency. Paul says the markup on media buys is 15 percent, so $25 million in billings would bring in about $3.75 million to the company; the rest would have to be paid down the line to the outlets that run their ads.

They occasionally talk about padding their profits in other ways, but it's mostly little stuff like billing the clients for dubious minor expenses."

"I think a white-washed image of Stalin is more likely, since Stalin actually accomplished something. As big and important as this all seems to us, in 500 years the Nazis are unlikely to be seen as that relevant. They ruled for 12 years, 6 of them in a war that ended in their absolute destruction. 

If you wanted you could write a narrative about how Stalin modernized an agricultural peasant society, turning it into a nuclear-armed satellite-launching super-power within a generation. Sure, that would require minimizing the millions of people killed, but there's a 'positive end point' toward which you could write a narrative.

"Nazis loved using violence to silence opposition, and of course they also suppressed other political groups with censorship. Violence is wrong no matter who does it, censorship is wrong no matter who does it. 

And the nazis were socialist. They just believed the division came from ethnicity and not wealth. They wanted a ethnically hegemonic society for germans and believed that jews were trying to stop this and that slavs and non Western Europeans were basically only fit for slave labor. They heavily regulated their markets for rearming the military, created social programs for germans, and basically increased the role of the state in society. 

Socialism is extremely diverse belief, there are many sub ideologies in it, much like there is for capitalism and communism. So when people say the nazis are socialists this is true, but they’re not saying all socialist are nazis, that would be false. "

"&gt; Okay. So I have some bad news on this one. FFXIV is a game where the developers want you to experience the expansions as originally as intended (with the slight exception of the speed with which you level).

&gt; Unfortunately, because the game was designed in certain ways back in the day, those design choices, as limiting as they are, are 100% still present and you 100% have to deal with them. If you want to experience the story from the beginning, you will spend a VERY long time doing the Main Story Quest from the original rerelease (A Realm Reborn). The MSQ starting at level 50 takes a very, very long time and if you actually want to experience the story, you will have to do it. You will likely greatly outlevel the content as a result. But you'll have to do it. Sorry.

You say that as if it was a bad thing.

The fact that Final Fantasy XIV treat its storyline as the focus of the game, and endgame as an extra, is the main reason a lot of us prefer this over most other MMOs.

The experience of going through the story is great. It's way more fun than any MMORPG endgame has ever been."

"God I wish we could just get a letter in the mail all Hogwarts-style that’s like “yes you’re trans” that would be so much easier!!!

I don’t have any of those diagnosis, but my therapist and I are starting to wonder if I spent a good deal of my childhood dissociated (or something like it) to deal with growing up in a family where being trans was definitely not an option. I genuinely believed I was a girl until after I moved out on my own, when it was safe to connect in to myself enough to be aware of feeling male. I also was really sensitive to what other people wanted and would think that I wanted the same things they did, only to often realize later that I didn’t. So I do kind of relate to feeling like you can’t trust your feelings and experiences.

I can’t say I ever felt 100% sure until several years on T, but I will say that every step that I took towards living as male felt more and more “right”, and more connected to myself, so I kept going. Just from what you described, it doesn’t sound like you have a problem with thinking you are things that you aren’t, just with not being connected in to who you are? (And sorry if I got that wrong, I’m on mobile so I can’t see your original post while I’m typing this) If feeling male and expressing yourself that way feels more “real” and connected, and less disconnected and unclear, maybe it’s a feeling to pay attention to?

I don’t know if any of that was helpful, but what you wrote kind of resonated with me and I wanted to respond. "
"All I want is for you to explain the unsubstantiated  speculation that makes up like 90% of your first post about OP, the situation OP and his wife are in, and the continuity of such behaviors on an extended length timeline.

TBH at this point, I believe you probably just think OP is a regular daily piece  of shit  b/c of penis and b/c he made his wife upset.  Am I way off?  Cool! Tell me why!!!!!  I’m like actually prompting you to tell me WHY IM WRONG

Explain your assumptions.  Maybe everything you said is valid and I’m actually a jackass.  Come on dude. I’m all ears here.  Make me look like a jackass.  Explain why OP is definitively a repeat offender as you’ve stated.  

That’s the third time I’ve asked you.  Surely you had some reasoning?  It can’t be a bias on your part can it?  You had SOME reason to assume such things yeah?

...

You wanna know why I brought Gender/feminism into it?  To call you the fuck out and make you explain your assumptions.   But we both know you fucking can’t. 

OP is NTA b/c, in the context of this job interview, he needs more accommodation than people who are not doing a job interview (i.e. his wife).  This helps the family and him, as opposed to just helping the wife and possibly endangering the family income.  It is not his duty to ensure she is in an optimal situation at all times.  I believe she should be more malleable to the situation and, if it becomes intolerable, she must be able to take the steps independently to better her situation.  Her husband has a separate duty and task that is fundamentally unrelated to her comfort or lack thereof, and as such he has no responsibility to her in that regard.  If the risks to her comfort were that dependent on the empty house, she needs to have contingencies in place that won’t disrupt her husband’s reason for being there.  In my opinion she is being pretty selfish to demand he drive her 5 hours back from where they come from.  I hope that I would never do something so selfish to my wife if the situation was reversed.

Have a nice day"

I try to go by that ‘would you do it again in a month/year and would you regret it in that time frame?’ So no I wouldn’t loan my friend 200$ for her rent because she overspent on clothes.

"You don't need rules for roleplaying; the rules are there so the game doesn't devolve into ""I hit you!"" ""No you didn't!"" ""Yes I did!"" ""Nuh-uh!"" ""I'm telling!"" like when little kids play pretend. In fact, you *can't* actually have rules for roleplaying, because it's not something that has rules any more than playing pretend has rules. What you have are *guidelines* for roleplaying. Ways to focus your characters, such as suggestions for how certain races or classes act. So let's look:

Each race and class gives you several paragraphs as to what they're like. These are guidelines for roleplaying. For instance, you don't need to know that Dragonborn are ""Proud Dragon Kin"" or that Paladins have a ""Cause of Righteousness"" just for combat reasons. You use that knowledge for roleplaying purposes.

Each background gives you traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. These are guidelines for roleplaying. Also, these are in chapter 4 of the PH, which is entitled ""Personality and Background."" You don't use personality and background for combat. You use it for roleplaying.

And there's this tidbit from page 185 of the PH: 

&gt;Roleplaying is a part of **every aspect of the game**, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve. [emphasis mine]

Again, you don't need rules to cover this, because this is acting. The rules are there to keep people from doing just anything. "

Right. It's because of people like you that those that actually put forth the immense amount of effort to spawn S Ranks in this game are going to stop, or they're not going to bother relaying to the entitled masses and instead you'll never even get a notification that the S Rank is up or have an opportunity to get any credit whatsoever."

"&gt; Bredesen’s moderation will only matter in the case that Dems have total control, in the sense that Susan Collins’ moderation only matters when Rs are in full control. But even then, moderates don’t get to dictate policy, they don’t even get to dictate what issues come up for votes. They typically get to put the brakes on the worst of their parties on the issues that those worst elements select as worthy of discussion.

I understand things have been this way in recent years, but I don't like it, and I don't think it's inevitable that things are this way. It hasn't even always been this way during my lifetime. It seems like not too far back, there was a lot of bipartisan cooperation.

Ideally, I'd like the bulk of legislation to be drafted through bipartisan cooperation, in which case moderates have a lot of influence because they end up drafting and refining legislation and they can oppose something if it gets too extreme.

I suggest you look into bettering yourself before you start blaming things on him. Prostitution isn’t a bad job, but if you find it degrading then it’s not for you. Maybe look into getting a different job before going back. Or if you do use some of that money for even some cheap online classes that may help you get something you like more. "

"It was an all around bad situation that he handled badly. Going into the marriage with doubts that big and an almost dread of their future is probably going to be a disaster as well down the road. He shouldn’t have proposed at all if he wasn’t sure, and, if he was having the second thoughts before the wedding, he should’ve been talking with Anya about them and addressing them LONG before the Wedding Day. 

I do think not going through with the marriage is better than going through with it when one foot’s our the door, but he shouldn’t have waited till the wedding to talk to Anya about that. 

Though it’s been ages so maybe I’m misremembering details about why he had the commitment issues (but even in that case, going through with the marriage is a terrible decision). Backing out was the lesser of two evils at that point, but it never should have gotten that far. "

"if you believe people are punished for all eternity in hell, then I don't see how that is anything resembling ""moderate."" The reality is most people actually ARE extremist, because when you start rationally analyzing their thoughts and ideas, religious people definitely are extreme. even the ones that don't even believe in a Hell have some pretty wild ideas if you think about what they say. It is extreme but that doesn't mean it's false. Truth is sometimes extreme.

But I understand a moderate person who is a ""normal"" thinker who believes that God didn't make humans in order for humans to worship him. If you really think about it, these ideas are somewhat extreme. In a way, we have to conclude that we are extremists. That's different from concluding that our ideas are false."

"At least in Finland you can start a business very easily but running it successfully will be a different thing.

The more responsibility is involved the stricter the requirements are. Legal, medical, education, security, etc. - out of question without a degree. Outside the circle of formal competence I'd say a degree has way less weight than in e.g. US or big European countries.

Language may become a major barrier. You can't just slip an English written contract paper in front of a private customer and assume it has any value. A handshake is enough until things become a hot mess.

PT is not a controlled title but there's an association which has a list of authorized PTs which you can't get your name on unless you have solid training. Such training won't be a massive obstacle which means competition is fierce.

Quackery laws are being prepared. No more homepathetism, please. Aromatherapist will survive but nutrition therapist is already reseved for those who have a university degree. There will always be space for all kinds of mental and spiritual leaders but there won't be many customers as people are rather educated. Find your niche amongst the less informed, perhaps.

I bet you could start a house painting business but in reality it is not an easy job nor it is easy money and needs skill and knowledge. Professional painters (more like surfacing experts here) are trained in vocational school for a three years (I believe). Foreign construction expert ""gangs"" making paint and roof jobs etc. are a constant headache. Their quality goes from poor to damage and destruction. Don't imagine being any better without education.

Setting up a restaurant might not be that difficult but requires e.g. hygienics training, cooking skills, and constant bureaucracy. Food safety standards are the highest in the World. A bar or a pub might be easier apart from customer handling.

Small scale retail/web store or import/export from home country might work if there's anything interesting available. Product regulations in EU are pretty tight. No illicit substances, OK?

Self training in software is always a possibility for tech/science dropouts and otherwise smart guys. It's not uncommon to work remotely for foreign companies as individual entrepreneurs.

Large portion of foreigners without education will stay unemployed unless they can produce value. Unfortunately skin color, name, and other things may have an impact too."

"In a [new post on Bleeding Heart Libertarians](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2018/10/two-hypotheses-about-the-leftward-slant-in-academia/), Jason Brennan considers whether academia might actually be a super right-wing institution in terms of actual behavior, and the left-wing stuff is ""expressive recompense"".

This article quotes heavily from a Tyler Cowen post considering whether Los Angeles might actually be America's most conservative city:

&gt;Right-wing isn’t exactly the right word, but neither is conservative nor  libertarian.  Let’s put it this way: in which American city is the principle of sexual dimorphism so pronounced and so accepted and so built into the city’s most fundamental sector (Hollywood)?  In which  American city is risk-taking and the resultant income inequality so much  a part of the founding culture, in this case the business of  entertainment?  Entertainment is also relatively free of government  interference and subsidy, and has been so from its beginnings in  American history.  In which city are the market outcomes — the winners  and losers — so accepted as the final verdict of relevance? 

Similarly, Brennan supposes, academia is full of power hierarchy and status competition, with a lot of winner-take-all rewards up for grabs.  


&gt;The academy is an incredibly right-wing place in terms of behavior,  though left-wing in terms of expression. Consider: Status competition is  everywhere. Universities and colleges jockey for elite status and for  higher rankings than their peers. Universities and colleges try to get  into positions where they can refuse 80% or more of their potential  customers. Academic job markets often follow something of a tournament  model. The select few winners receive far higher compensation, status,  and freedom than nearly everyone else. Hierarchy is everywhere: among  schools, among journals, among disciplines (economics &gt; sociology  &gt; history), among professors within individual fields, inside the  structure of the university itself. The academy is full of individuals  jockeying for power, money, and prestige. And there is rarely any  external check to force this selfishly motivated behavior to actually  serve the good of others. 

As a side note, this resonated with me because on my one visit to L.A., I immediately felt like I ""got"" the city, as the vibe very much seemed about status competition and gaining riches.

It's the same reason you hear people go on about how capitalism is failing so many, yet they don't understand what we have in the US is far from free market capitalism.

"As someone with a.... let's shorthand to ""crazy,"" mother (similar to your situation) and a very patient, calm, understanding father... 

They've been married for like, 35+ years, and while he can find it frustrating, he doesn't want to leave. He loves her for reasons entirely unrelated to her ""crazy,"" and he loves her enough to put up with that. I don't think that her issues *don't* affect him, but they clearly affect him less than they affect me, for example. He has a very high tolerance for that sort of thing. 

While this is a decision that you're entitled to make, don't make it on his behalf. If he wants to stay with you--not just because he'd feel guilty if he didn't, but because he wants to be with you--then it's not up to you to decide that it's better for him if you leave. Leave because it's right for you, or stay because it's right for you. Likewise, make sure that he knows that he can leave if that's right for him, or he can stay if that's what he wants. 

If you feel guilty about how your disorders affect him, start looking for treatment. Have you gone to a doctor? A therapist? Have you researched strategies for managing panic attacks and mood swings? Are you working on being mindful about your moods, so you can start to identify what's a mood swing and what's your actual feelings about your current situation? When you can identify your mood swings in real time, you can better control how you behave during them. At the very least, you'll be able to warn people in the moment that you may be saying things you don't mean, because you're up/down/etc. "

"&gt;blocking rails

historically this is diplomatic suicide and counterproductive. 

If you really want to block travel, just have one or two really hyped up PvPers who have a license to randomly pearl people who enter your land, then put anybody who 'trespasses' on your land claim in your vault without trial or any review process, then hold all diplomatic communications in voicechats so there's no proof of what you've said or alternatively just blackmail the person via text so that they can't appeal to the international community. 

In this manner, you will slowly drain the will to play or even protest their pearling from your victims until they ragequit or just quietly leave, slowly undermining your opponent's towns until those towns die out and you can give the land to your 'secret' (ie, voicechat only) friends so that they can be a thorn in the side of your rivals and opponents until the end of the map. 

Rinse and repeat until you've stagnated the server via endless exclaves and random territories that even actually malicious enemies have no idea they've entered so that you can, when pressed, publicly justify any abuse of power by shouting about 'sovereignty' and 'trespassing'. 

Bonus points if when the person gets pissed you point to it and claim 'see? They were hostile all along, this person is unstable, this is why we pearled them' to thoroughly discredit their reputation so that in the event that somebody questions your actions you can release them without fear that they might build up a town that will now certainly be hostile to you.

The E400 Sedan model arrives this year, boasting a 3.0L V6 biturbo engine producing 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque — the same powertrain that currently drives its E400 Coupe, Cabriolet and 4MATIC Wagon cousins. Paired with the 9-G-TRONIC 9-Speed automatic transmission and DYNAMIC SELECT, it promises a bracingly smooth way to experience uncommon luxury. Naturally, the 2018 E400 Sedan continues the tradition of E-Class brilliance. Harmonizing advanced automotive intelligence with awe-inspiring interior design, its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips — even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence. ""Car-to-X"" Communication enables the E-Class to exchange information with similarly equipped vehicles — effectively allowing it to ""see"" around corners and through obstacles to detect potential hazards. Driver Assistance Systems — including Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC®, Active Steering Assist and Active Lane Change Assist — feature intelligent cruise control: They help keep you between the lines, and can even help you shift between them. Inside, the E-Class cabin provides an environment of pure comfort and responsive technology. Flowing lines and vibrant screens provide a striking visual display, while touch controls, aromatherapy and tailored seats indulge all of your senses at once. It's a vehicle that demands to be driven, and more than lives up to the dream. Look for the E400 4MATIC Sedan at your Mercedes-Benz dealership this winter, with an MSRP of $58,900"

"Need more control cards. Freeze is one step but we need global and/or lane buffs/debuffs that can outweigh  the freeze, or at least provide other optimal choices.

For example, an AoE frenzy buff for attack speed for units in a specific radius may be chosen instead of one card if balanced effectively. The issue is with a staggered release on these types of cards as you'll run into a similar situation to now. For balance, you'd be better off releasing 4-6 all at once to see what sticks. 

As is, the other summons just don't provide strong enough effects. Give bats a fear that forces a retreat, for example, if you don't want to introduce new cards right now."

"IT helpdesk is really not as glamorous as you may think. A+ is a pretty generic cert and basically the easiest one to obtain that actually means anything. If you want to get a decent job in IT that isn’t a dead end helpdesk job, you need to specialize in something; whether it be networking, database, etc etc. I suggest starting with Microsoft certs (server/msa/msp/etc) and then branching out from there into Cisco certs or whatever you’re most fluent in.

Trust me, 75% of people that work IT helpdesk are just draining to work with, and a lot of MSPs that hire entry level helpdesk positions use you for what they can before you have enough and find another job. IT helpdesk turnover rates are usually very high, which is why you need a specific skill set to make yourself employable and to avoid that trap. This is some real advice from somebody who’s been through it, got out, and started their own business. Good luck"

I think you should make it clear that you won't tolerate his behavior. Threaten him, if you must, with either telling your parents or something else that would scare him away.

"I don't necessarily disagree, but you have to look at two factors here.



A. We're already 3-3. Let's be real, those 3 L's felt Patriots and their extended preseason stuff. We've gotten into a groove, we're beating the best teams in the NFL, and are on a win streak. But realistically with our talent we finish between somewhere to 10 or even 12 wins. Is that enough though? NFC North is powerful, and the Vikings or Chicago might be able to run the division out on us. But let's say we go 10-6, make wildcard, we now got a real hard schedule, facing 3 playoff teams on the road. We'd definitely want homefield advantage.




B. The NFC isn't what we thought it'd be, but there's still a lot of good teams to face. We can't just face Buffalo or some shit, we'd have to play some hard fucking teams. Imagine if we face another NFCN rival in the postseason, or what if we run into a hot Carolina? It's a hard list of teams to beat."

"&gt;Openly selling Plan B pills will automatically make some people think that it's okay to take it because it's legal and what not, plain and simple ( Not all humans are bright and i'm looking out for them).

So you're on board with drug prohibition in general? What about environmental regulations and gun control? Using your same logic about protecting people from themselves, one would end up with positions that are decidedly not conservative.

Beyond that, it *is* okay to take emergency contraception! That is what you *want* someone to think! What's the better outcome? ""Uh oh, better have this child for which neither of us want and were not prepared to have, that's definitely in society's best interest!"" 

&gt;And yes taking it once probably won't affect the person, but like i said, there will always be people that take it too much and it will ultimately screw up their health. 

And what of the great, vast majority of people who realize life-altering benefits when they take it as prescribed? Do you even know how often one would have to take it to really screw up their health? 

&gt;No, my mom did not do anything like that. But let me tell you, Kim Kardashian is a perfect example of what i'm talking about. We've all seen her nude body and she makes little girls think that it's okay to do what she does. People look up to her and will replicate what she does to ""be like her"". Take the kylie jenner lip challenge as an example.. 

So you take issue with pornography in general...? Alright but I'm not sure what that has to do with the availability of birth control. Birth control makes people want to get famous from sex tapes? You gotta remember that the KimK tape wasn't an accident. She wasn't any A-lister, but she was a known celebrity/socialite who released a sex tape that had an immediate, insanely high demand. 

What is it that she has done that is not okay in your mind? I wouldn't call her a great role model, but saying that what she has done is ""not okay"" is a pretty strong statement. If I had a semicelebrity daughter that did a sex tape, I wouldn't be thrilled but if it was done of her own volition, I mean, what're you gonna do? I'd think it had more to do with the values I raised her with than think the availability of plan B was the reason for any of it. 


&gt;And posing in swimwear is perfectly okay, it's just when it goes overboard and they start to strip down more, showing body parts that don't need to be shown. 

So, porn then? Yes, I'd think it tacky and lowbrow to post porn of yourself on your social media accounts if you're not starring in adult media. 

But that's not what you said. Half naked, hell even almost naked, is a totally different world than actually naked. 

And again, I don't see how like any of this has anything to do with the availability of plan B...an adult film star is going to be on birth control anyway, and if someone is so braindead as to think, ""Hey, I should do pornography because that other person got famous from it, I want to be sextape famous too"" then I *definitely* want them on birth control.

"I think you have a very severe misunderstanding of the rules.

&gt;If all non-incidental contact is illegal then players cannot slow down to box out on hucks, funnel a handler with their bodies, or take a divergent path towards a disc and bump shoulders without there being a foul (or two) on the play. 

This is blatantly incorrect. If I box you out, and you either don't notice or ignore it to try and run through me, I can call a foul, correct. Yes, I could technically call a foul if you're pushing me from behind, I think that's a feature. If you tried your best to avoid contact and there's still some, if it doesn't affect me I don't call it (I not just being me but I'm assuming most if not all players). It's obviously not a foul on the player boxing out as they are not initiating contact.

I don't see there being a massive difference between boxing out and funneling a handler, but I might just not know the terminology well enough.

Bumping shoulder can either be incidental or offsetting fouls.. or even just a singular foul (someone no longer running forwards but into the player they're neck and neck with). Obviously depends on the situation.

The throw being a travel is a pretty bogus call, as far as I see it the thrower maintained contact with the specific spot on the field throughout the throw. 

&gt;The answer to both is that I'm trying to stress a difference between the rule (incidental) and the application (significance or intentionality, which are subjective but are often the terms used when deciding these discussions).

I don't think that people using a rule incorrectly is a good argument. ""Didn't affect play"" is extremely well known in all the circles that I play, which admittedly does not intersect with USAU whatsoever."

If you pass the next wrong is a personality test, try to answer everything like you're introverted/a quant and you'll pass. After that is an automated video interview.

"Psychiatrists don't really understand serotonin, to be honest.

They prescribe it without really knowing what it does, which, in my opinion, is irresponsible.

If it is ""making your thoughts seem (more) real"" - there might be a way for you to hypergame that to your advantage.  I mean if it amplifies thoughts, can you find a way to amplify good/positive/productive thoughts?

I assume that if it has some benefit in OCD, that probably means that some people have figured out ways to ""game"" it.

I'm guessing you need to experiment with it and see if you can't think of a way to use - whatever it is that it appears to do - to your advantage.

(i.e. If it makes negative, intrusive thoughts seem more ""real"", it probably also would make positive thoughts seem more ""real"".  Try making yourself a script of positive thoughts to repeat to yourself-or-something).

Timothy Leary seemed to think it might let people ""reprogram"" themselves a little bit, or at least that's what he thought LSD did - which acted on serotonin receptors.  

So - I don't know - maybe write down some positive thoughts of what you want to think about and try to reprogram yourself with positive thoughts, or something?

Either that, or ask your doctor to take you off."

"Its all hypocrisy too.  Its good for the league if its YOUR team that's doing it.  Fans of the other 29 teams hate it, though.  

For me, dynasties are not the problem, I never felt like the Bulls dynasty was a bad thing for the NBA.  I don't feel the Patriots are bad for the NFL.  


When I think of what's ""bad for the league"" my mind ALWAYS floats back to what Matt Barnes said once.  I can't emphasize enough how right he was: Only about 5 owners are really in this to win titles.  No one else is, that's why 25 teams don't have a chance.  


Dynasties exist because most other teams in the league aren't doing everything they could be doing to maximize winning.  Read the Darius Miles piece on the Player's Tribune, the Clippers were training at a Community College in South Central for years!  


Why do fans bemoan the great teams from doing everything they can to keep winning, and don't blame THEIR owners for not putting in nearly enough resources or effort to win?  Why do we celebrate the ""Race to the Bottom"" mentality, when everyone can be ineffective, cheap and lazy, be we don't celebrate the ""race to the top"" where everyone is competing and making each other better?  


Why are overachievers hated, but not underachievers?  The Overachievers are the ones driving league-wide revenue.  Have you seen the attendance in Charlotte on an ordinary Wednesday night when the Hornets are hosting the Magic?  What happens when the Hornets are hosting the Warriors, or the Lakers?  


Have you seen Charlotte's division?  The Wizards, Heat, Magic and Hawks.  Why can't Charlotte make a run at that division?  Why can't the Wizards?  Why can't the Magic?  Why can't any of those teams dominate the sledge of mediocrity that is their division?  
At least the warriors have always had the Lakers in their division as an excuse.

Also they can chime in here and have a conversation  at any given time and we wouldn’t know since this sub is not affiliated with PlayStation. I’m sure they do check our subreddit from time to time but we can’t verify that unless they tell us with proof. They make everyone go through the hoops before they make people participate and talk in the forums. This subreddit is not employee verified and we have taken the precautious of not having to deal with random people trying to find their ways into to take advantage of Zunos and faking their way into verifying themselves because there has been instances of that and On.PS has actually made tweets regarding that with fake pay stubs and failed verification forms when the program was still in its infancy. We don’t want the Rewards announced because we feel like it would limit jealousy and hate towards us and of course other people on this forum.

The efforts of the moral leaders, Arthur and TF, are about growing a sober and technical-savy ecosystem and in having an actual product without issues. It could be considered not posh, but these are rare and powerful assets in the blockchain world of today, eager to stage amazing visions and miserable in delivering them.

"The 15400 v3 from JF just came in bout an hour ago and I’m still in awe. Speechless. I read probably every thread about this watch and everyone loves it but I still put it off until recently. Big thanks u/columbusy for the sale, I can’t be any happier. This model as some flaws, case too thick, brushing not as gen, spacing of the dial text, and arguably the hands. But none of those matter, this watch is drop dead gorgeous and more comfortable than any pair of socks you own. This watch made me lose interest in gens. Big kudos to JF, those guys are incredible. I will forever honor and cherish this watch. IMO it smokes the entry level Swiss for the same money in terms of fit and finish. Biggest problem is the fact that I waited so long to get one. If you’re even slightly considering this AP rep, buy it. "

Most of all tell her she’s beautiful, that you love her."

"God has done a whole lot of things in the past couple hundred of years according to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Members of that church have faith today for several reasons such as: 
The evidence found through the Book of Mormon (a testament of Jesus Christ written in the Americas while the Bible was being written, which was revealed by God to the prophet Joseph Smith who then translated it into English by the power of God). 
Or the restoration of the authority to act in the name of God given to man to lead and direct his work today is another one. 
Then there are ordinances of salvation such as baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost that are done by that authority.

I’m surprised that more people aren’t at least aware of this since the Church puts a lot of effort into missionary work and spreading their message. And I don’t mean to come off like I’m trying to shove these beliefs down anyone’s throat, I’m simply just sharing what’s out there to help answer the question.

Abstract

Emotional signals, like threatening sounds, automatically ready the perceiver to prepare an appropriate defense behavior. Conjecturing that this would manifest itself in extending the safety zone around the body we used the rubber hand illusion (RHI) to test this prediction. The RHI is a perceptual illusion in which body ownership is manipulated by synchronously stroking a rubber hand and real hand occluded from view. Many factors, both internal and external, have been shown to influence the strength of the illusion, yet the effect of emotion perception on body ownership remains unexplored. We predicted that listening to affective vocalizations would influence how strongly participants experience the RHI. In the first experiment four groups were tested that listened either to affective sounds (angry or happy vocalizations), non-vocal sounds or no sound while undergoing synchronous or asynchronous stroking of the real and rubber hand. In a second experiment three groups were tested comparing angry or neutral vocalizations and no sound condition. There was a significantly larger drift towards the rubber hand in the emotion versus the no emotion conditions. We interpret these results in the framework that the spatial increase in the RHI indicates that under threat the body has the capacity to extend its safety zone.

Considering most people who have don’t know they have it, you are technically safer with someone who is aware of their status and educated on how to protect their partner.

You don't think there's a chance a single Leftist activist or rich person could do this?

While I'm still 100% open to the possibility that this wasn't a Leftist, that is by far most likely. Who benefits? The Left. Everyone knows a bomb threat against Democrats 2 weeks before the election would hurt Republicans.

This is NOT the same as 9/11 because Al Qaeda had committed many attacks against the US. They thought we were pussies who would retreat based on minor losses, so they aimed to inflict enough losses to make us leave the Middle East. Hell, most Americans these days have a ""to hell with the Middle East"" attitude. It may have even been a good, if evil and suicidal, strategy.

This move makes no sense for a Republican. It cannot do anything but hurt Republicans, especially right before an election."

2) add/alter events that would change his perspective on his rate of growth. If he isn't led to feel that continuing along his current path is futile then he'd obviously be more likely to stay.

Seeing those at his age range as his equals in strength or experiencing faster rates of growth would be a tough pill for him to swallow, considering he came out of the academy way ahead of his peers as rookie of the year.

"Yes, in multiple subjects: English language, literature, history, geography. 

When I was in high school (a decade ago), the final exam to get your high school diploma was mostly an oral exam, where each subject had 20-30 topics. On the day of the exam, you randomly selected one topic, and you had to talk about it for 15 minutes while also being able to answer additional questions from a panel.

The USA had its own topic in history called “the history of the United States” and was also an important component of other topics (e.g. WWI, WWII, Cold War). In a similar fashion, it was incorporated into multiple literature topics. And, last but not least, there were also multiple topics focusing solely on the USA in English language – I remember there were stand-alone topics on the political system in the USA, on the US geography, industry and trade, on the US literature, and on the US history. 

So, basically, it was hard to graduate from high school without being able to talk about the American revolution or knowing something about E.A.Poe, Hemingway, Whitman, Twain, and Salinger. "

"""Assets"" are just things.

""Liabilities"" are things that increase your risk or cost money (IE, a car payment is a liability, as is your mooching brother-in-law)

""Leverage"" is when you use debt to increase earnings or revenue or mitigate risk (IE, going into debt to pay for a tool that can allow you to produce widgets twice as fast, thereby allowing you to make money on widgets).

The reason many people stay poor is that they purchase assets that depreciate immediately (new phones, new cars, new computers), and that cannot be monetized. If you just need to get from A to B, a Honda Civic works just as well as a Mercedes S-class, and you'll find a lot of wealthy people *don't* drive nice cars, just because they view the vehicle as a tool and not a signaling device.

On a limited budget, you can:

- Toss the money into an index or mutual fund

- Buy a tool or device that you *can* monetize. For example, let's say you're an aspiring finish carpenter - 5K gets you some fine Dewalt tools, an air compressor, and even a jalopy to toss it all into. 

- Buy some education or certification to increase your earning power in a career you're already in."
"Try disconnecting the battery for 5 minutes and then idling it for 5 minutes. It'll reset the pcm.

"Doctor here. It is hard to say anything definitive from a low quality video, but the most likely scenario is that he intentionally released the bar as a ""bail out"" from the lift with the intention of it dropping behind him. Instead of falling safely to the ground, the bar hit the part of his back which sticks out the most, the spinous processes of the first few thoracic vertebrae.  The spinous processes are those bony bumps you feel down your spine. It likely hit one, fracturing the lamina on either side. The now untethered spinous process enters the spinal canal and crushes the spinal cord. This should result in partial paralysis, but all of the motor functions of the arms are controlled by cervical nerves except for T1 which would also be unaffected. If I am right, he should be paralyzed from chest down but retain movement of his arms. If not, something truly strange happened in the video. 

EDIT: does anyone have further information on this guy, what ended up happening to him? Now I’m curious. "

I don’t actually buy the numbers in the referenced surveys, I’ve been rather critical of them in the past on this very sub. I *agree* they’re largely bullshit. Doesn’t change the fact that we aren’t your fucking google monkey. If you have access to Reddit, you almost certainly have access to google too. Or Bing, if you’re a masochist. My advice that people learn to look shit up if they’re interested applies regardless of which side of the conversation I fall on. Because for me, it’s *not* a rhetorical device. It’s a firmly held belief that asking strangers to prove easily searchable information to you is obnoxious twattery. 

For what it’s worth, I *did* claim in another thread that “a majority” were likely from “the area.”  I don’t actually have a source for that, I’ll admit, other than the same surveys. I absolutely reject that 80% are from King County, but it does seem at least reasonably likely that a majority are from Washington. You can reject that conclusion if you please, neither of us will be able to prove much either way since the only thing harder to track than the homeless is *maybe* wildlife. "

"Interesting post. I really should have gotten back into looking at philosophy from an academic framework in my down time, but I never quite made it for some reason. 

There's absolutely interesting questions being asked by all the various characters in Madoka. And I do think that the decision of demon-Homura was the best thing the movie could have done, especially as I personally don't think it breaks her character but rather continues it. I just... can't stand the way they implemented it. They did it with rough brush strokes hoping the audience would fill in the rest, which in itself is not a bad thing, but here they did it so rough that you have to actively be trying to piece things together to make sense of how demon-Homura fits and that I disliked. 

Interestingly this is the same issue I see with NGE, but in that they handed you the philosophical framework inside the show, while the characters are debatably just ambiguous. "

Why do political attack ads exist? Why do politicians pay so much money to expose the other candidate? If what you're saying is true, these attack ads wouldn't exist. The same applies here. This is basically a negative ad that puts the company in a bad light. 

What you are doing, and what a lot of other people are doing, is trying to make it difficult for somebody to search through this subreddit based on company names to see which ones pop up more frequently, which could indicate how much effort is being put into pushing certain brands. I think that is the underlying original reason for the campaign in this sub to stop people from putting the name of the company in the title. You're helping them.

Some people close to me had it worse (my boyfriend was *stabbed* by a classmate in fifth grade; yes, on school grounds and during school hours).

I'm not suggesting all schools are terrible or that homeschooling is the ultimate solutuon to the problems of public school. I'd just rather public school not be put on a pedestal because it really can be terrible. The only good thing I ever got from my school years is my best friend, but as much as I love her, she can't make up for the hell those years were. That said, she is the only reason I never burned my second high school (where we met) to the ground (that, and arson is illegal).

And no, I haven't forgiven those kids who made those years hell. Fuck them. I don't wish well for any of those kids, and that their behavior is excused because ""kids will be kids"" is the biggest reason I won't let my (non-existent) kid go through that.

I'm glad you and others enjoyed your time at public school. I, unfortunately, did not and wish I could burn all of those memories out of my mind. It wasn't worth it."

"Person A gets upset when he hears about dog-fighting rings in a nearby town. Yet, when he hears about how pigs are treated in factory farms he has no reaction, or even thinks it is justified given that they are farm animals and thus created for food. Person A claims that he hates when dogs suffer. Given that there is no deep reason, I argue, to think that pigs and dogs *deserve* morally different treatment, Person A's decision is a case of cognitive dissonance. 

Especially since he likely does not actively hate pigs, and would very likely be friendly with a pig if he saw one as a pet.

Person A is a pet lover and not an animal lover, which is a morally odd position.

"I appreciate all the technical input there, but, given how hard the Soviets and Chinese will be working on cracking US stealth (with the help of that stealth drone they quietly hijacked over Iran a few years ago), I believe my basic point stands (which is not necessarily that the F-35 is worse than old aircraft (and remember the F-111 is 60s tech!), but rather that it is not sufficiently superior to warrant the cost). 

Even in the scenario above, Wedgetail is detecting a low/fast 60s bomber travelling at 480kt, at about 150km... that's a thin margin for the defender.

The extremely long lead time for the F-35 means it's closer to obsolescence once in service.  I'm curious also as to how likely it is to be detected when refuelling, which would have to occur for any serious Australian-scenario interdiction?

The F-35 will cost each taxpayer about $4000 (cost over life divided by number of taxpayers), the submarines are shaping up to cost twice what the F-35 program is... and that's for two weapons.  Given how obsessed we are about costs as applied to education, health and so on, it's interesting that none of Australians' reflexive public spending frugality applies to weapons.

"Manson ordered his followers to commit the Tate-LaBianca murders because he was trying to jumpstart what he purported to believe would be the coming race war between the government and black citizens — in particular the Black Panthers, whom he hated. Manson had dubbed this movement Helter Skelter, preaching that the Beatles’ White Album song of the same name — which was written about an amusement park — was about the forthcoming war. Throughout the summer months of 1969, Manson had been hinting to his followers that if black Americans didn’t start Helter Skelter, the Family should help it along."

"I'll work with what I know here, so please excuse my mention of EOS on the CC subreddit, but I'm looking at this purely from a capabilities standpoint.

EOS is incredibly quick, has no fees (if it does then they're less than 1/1000th of a cent), and is extremely scalable through the use of sidechains. Additionally it is a complete smart contract platform.

The people we have to persuade to use the tech first are businesses, these will be the guys that lead adoption. As a business I don't care about how ""centralised"" some people on an online forum think it is. I see a platform that offers all of what Nano does, and then also has smart contracts. Why should I pick a less capable system?

This could also be said for Ethereum once they sort out the scaling issues, which they will no doubt sort out."

"Perhaps you are one of those people who thrive in a more structured work environment like deadlines and having external accountability would help? Have you heard of the four tendencies by Gretchen Rubin? She divides people into four groups depending on how they react to internal and external expectations. Some people do well without external expectations (which can take the forms of coworkers, deadlines) while others don't. I suspect that maybe having deadlines and coworkers will make you more productive. If that's the case, all you need to do is to create external accountability for yourself and you can achieve what you want to. Perhaps give this a try and maybe you just need to have a different working style than others in the program.

At 122 lbs, I'm guessing you don't need or want to lose weight.

If general health, your current macros are probably perfect: 1,325 Cal, 20g carbs, 107g fat, and 73g protein.  Always eat the full amount of protein, okay to eat less than the full amount of fat.

Did you want to lose weight? At 122 lbs, you'll never lose weight on 1300 calories.  Re-do macros to get to 1200 or 1100 calories if you want to lose weight.

Either way, I don't know easily available Japanese food, but you do.  Beef? Chicken? Eggs? Tofu?  I know they have a lot of veggies and many are low carb.  What are the best saturated fats and oils available?

Anywhere from 1100 to 1300 calories is not a lot of food, and can easily be done by eating one big portion meat/egg/tofu, one big portion veggie, all covered in high-fat sauce or oil, at every meal.

"One thing that I find weird is coming from SC2 or CS:GO you are supposed have have a 50% win rate. Because that means you are being matched against equally skilled players (on average, save a few outliers). 

But Destiny punishes non-win streaks so to acquire the gear you want the best way to do that is by stacking against bad players. 

Trails is super weird in this aspect. It is less about playing the best teams and more about RNG'ing a set of wins against lesser skilled groups, especially if you can time the que right and land on the same group multiple times. 

As we all know, players will always take the shortest path to the best gear possible. Even if that means throwing grenades at atheons feet, disconnecting a hive gods reinforcements, or platforming out of bounds to get a chest. And in that case it really is up to Bungie to design a system that rewards playing the game and less playing the system."

"I believe Past Mashiro would be the better option, since she has Frenzy, she's Heart attribute (which means you can use her for more stages when playing casually), and she's newer, which generally means she has higher stats (if you want to compare their stats, you can use the site bravesouls.fyi, or the album function in-game). I don't recall what TLA Rukia's Killer is, but Past Mashiro has a Hollow Killer effect (if I recall correctly), which is pretty useful, since lots of stages have Hollow mobs. 

But ultimately it comes down to which character is easier and more fun to play as, and that's just personal preference."

The muscle twitches and trouble sleeping might be a bit concerning sign, if you really want to stick with 2x a week, I'd try and space it out to Mon and Thu. just to give more time in between. Clam average half life is about 14 hours so at *minimum* I believe it's 3 times that number for your body to completely rid itself of the drug. So best case scenario, your body is 6-7 hours without Clam, but depending on metabolic rates it might still be there by the time you're redosing on Wed. Some people put the number as high as five times the half life to be rid of xanax. Furthermore, I believe clam is lipophilic, meaning that it can combine or dissolve in your fat cells where it might stay there for a long time. So, all of this makes it entirely possible you might slowly be heading down another physical dependency road.

All in all, I'd look for an alternative to clam if you want long term. I enjoy it just as much as anyone else, but as of now I will only do clam around once a month just because of the immense half life and fine line it has between good time and blackout. "

Therefore, I will buy the game when the price goes down to that amount of money."

"Both, in reverse order. My teeth were genetical defunct. I had lost a bunch over the years. and wasted huge $ on repair  work, back in the days BEFORE they numbed a tooth before drilling!

I was down to 04-08 left, I had them removed, leaving   06 at the bottom front, to hang the lower dental plate on.

"Most of the volatility is because interest rates are rising faster than expected, which is causing a selloff. This is completely beyond Trump's control, much to his dismay, as the federal reserves operates independent of federal government, with the duty to maintain both low unemployment and inflation.(This is a good thing, stops politicians from keeping interest rates low to get re-elected, creating inflation in the process). Tariffs may have played a small role in the selloffs(valid criticism of Trump, these tariffs are bad for the economy), but the fact that companies unaffected by the tariffs(such as tech companies) are falling is an indicator that the selloff is mostly due to interest rates.

Even with the stock market correction of the past week or two, the economy is doing well as a whole. Tons of job opportunities, inflation still low, lots of innovation."

The precision instruments have a guarded knob on the side to adjust the torque. Also it’s a beam style so I don’t have to put it back to minimum torque to remove the load when storing it. "

On Nov 1st, that money will roll over to November and will still be ready to spend on your bill but your category for November will be orange. This is because while you have $100 in your envelope from before, you told YNAB you wanted to ADD $100 per month and you haven’t ADDED anything for November yet. That’s ok. Go ahead and pay your $100 phone bill on the 1st with the money you put in the category back in October. Now your category is at 0 and it’s still orange.

"Yea I can see where you are coming from. I’ve been a power user in android since the early days so going to nexus or pixel was always a step down in functionality and features, we had a few at work for testing apps, I mean you can’t even sign PDFs from stock. It really depends how you use the phone. If you are willing to pay for third party apps for lesser integration amongst other apps, and possibly no support for the latest android versions, and still miss out on other features then for sure pixels or nexus suits you to the tee. Even iPhone has more software features that are well integrated compared to pixel. A few of my friends who I convinced to go from iPhone to pixel ended up going back due to the huge feature gap. I think pixel android is still very immature and dev focused. Also what apps can you install on pixel that gets you full the ring ability with no issues? - in my experience I get more issues from these hacky apps like substratum no root etc - with risk of soft bricking from certain updates. Not really user friendly compared to other phones that offer this built in.

By the way, Thomas Jefferson was deeply hostile to religion, and Christianity in particular; he also said, ""The priest is the enemy of liberty and friend of the tyrant,"" described the concept of the Trinity as ""incoherent"", and mocked the idea of the Holy Spirit as ""the Abracadabra of mountebanks [*i.e. conmen and charlatans*] calling themselves the priests of Jesus.""

What do you think Thomas Jefferson would make of all the religious stupidity in the modern gun rights movement?

What do you think he would make of the fact that *this* is rapidly turning into the real core and base of the gun rights movement in 2018?

"Definitely go with the Note 9. Not going to be even close, even if you buy the nicest third party stylus you can find. The fact is the S9 doesn't have a digitizer in the screen. That's the tech that allows for accurate pen tracking on the Note 9... On Microsoft surfaces, wacom devices, iPad pro, etc. Without a digitizer it's going to be inaccurate, won't have palm rejection (and if it does it will suck, so your phone won't be able to ignore your resting palm), won't have pressure support (you won't be able to write a thin line or thick line based on pressure), it will have a higher input delay (time between when you touch the screen and the ink appears).. etc.

I understand that the Note seems big but you're definitely going to want the experience having an actual digitizer provides. I wanted a pen-enabled Samsung tablet for taking class notes and such. But I was mistakenly gifted the regular non-pen model and I tried to buy a third-party pen. I couldn't use it without it picking up my palm as input. Also it just lagged and didn't feel good writing. Traded it in and upgraded to the actual pen supported tablet. Totally different world."

Everyone seems to be mad at you, and I would be too, but the fact of the matter is I don't believe the story to begin with. Lost me as soon as you said he tested it. However, your defiance to say you lied does tend to make you look somewhat believable. You'd have to be doing acid when you were 10 too if you were that retarded to say something like that, truth or not, and defend that it happened at all rather than saying it was a joke for reddit karma.

Not all 200 hours are created equal and as you said in many cases should be split.  Like the (likely really really wrong) old WAG Chris made of 40 hours to earn a Connie.  Some people freaked ('40 hours, that's like playing all of some other game!') others shrugged ('40 hours in a MMO?

You’re choosing to complain about that instead of looking at the facts, like how forsakens ban is worse than Brax’s.

You have no real point but you’re still trying to push it. On top of that you’re trying your hardest to make it seem like what the IBP guys did, was harmless and didn’t matter, while on the other hand forsaken basically killed a kid.

"Sending is the only real magic that fits the bill. It would be extremely if not prohibitively expensive for anyone but a head of state or a big bad to create an object that can cast Sending at will. The guidelines for magic item creation for an item that can cast a spell with no limitations is caster level \* spell level \* 1800gp, so for Sending it would be 50,400 gp apiece, and that's for a cleric. Crafting each one will take 51 days, or half that if you increase the spellcraft DC by 5.

If the logistics are not a problem, I'd probably set it up to be similar to the telegram. You have maybe half a dozen of the magic items and a few trusted 'operators' per item hired to go to such-and-such major city and set up shop. People can go there and for a fee (consider the fees for spellcasting services, if you can even find a 9th level Cleric it's 360gp for him to cast Sending for you, and these operators can do it all day long) have a message sent to one of the operators in another city, who then scribe down the message and a courier delivers it to the recipient.

Say you charge 300gp to send a message, you get 10 people to send a message each day, six days a week. 3000gp a day, 18,000gp a week, minus wages. You'd make your investment back very quickly."
"You should start going out for runs and working out.

That way you both work out and you'll be closer as a couple"
"See my response above to another comment.  Basically filter and focus on the programs that are most flexible for you.  If you do a lot of domestic travel in the US, then you might want to look at building up points with American Airlines or better, Southwest or Alaska (regional).  You should check ROUTES on those airlines to see if they support the travel you do.  If you say ""general travel"" is your thing, then a combo of the big airline programs covering the big airline alliance networks could work.  For example, United is with Star Alliance, but there's also the OneWorld and SkyTeam alliances.  These airline alliances have transfer partners and your points / rewards can be transferred to their partners or earned by partners to add up your rewards.  You have to find out which alliance you should join based on how often you'll fly or use those partner airlines.  The most flexible rewards are best as they can be translated to almost anything.  I like to build those up by using credit cards such as Chase travel cards."

"I'd rather lose some games now and get rid of him, than scrape out a few wins and be stuck with him for another season. He's a terrible head coach. He's incapable of taking blame for his faults. His first instinct in any time of adversity is to throw his closest subordinate under the bus. Beyond that he's awful at the basic responsibilities of being a head coach. His clock management, challenges, in game adjustments, and more are all some of the worst examples of coaching I can remember. I've watched teams coached by guys like Pat Shurmur, Chris Palmer, Mike Pettine, Eric Mangini, and Hue is the most incompetent by far.

"Worth noting that all of these ""And then Zhuge Liang did something amazing and saved the day"" scenarios are from the *Romance of the Three Kingdom*, which is a romanticized novel written over 1000 years later that was pretty heavily biased in favor of the Shu Kingdom that Zhuge Liang served. Many of the amazing feats ascribed to Zhuge Liang in the *Romance* are either completely made up, or they were actually done by someone else (on a much smaller scale) and just given to Zhuge Liang instead, to build up his image. At one point the book even goes so far as to basically claim that Liang was essentially a wizard, capable of summoning a great wind to turn the tide at the Battle of Red Cliffs.

Historically, Zhuge Liang was still a pretty impressive strategist, but his far greater strength was in administration and diplomacy. As far as actually leading armies and waging battles, he was quite frequently outmatched my his contemporaries, and the Kingdom of Shu eventually fell to its rivals."

"I don’t have the original tartelette palette so I don’t know. I find that this palette is less pigmented than other brands like ABH and Lorac but I kinda like that since it’s better for everyday. For comparison sake, I find that it performs similarly to my MAC shadows (takes a bit more work to build up but is long-lasting and easy to blend). I think because half the shadows are shimmers it would be better than the original since Tarte mattes are very hit and miss (although for some reason the In Bloom mattes are decent and better than the other Tarte mattes I’ve tried esp. the Tartiest pro palette which is very chalky)."

That said, Hicks had...a weird irrational side to him, elements Linklater's unfortunately in tune with, so he's probably appropriate enough.  The psychedelics, the faux-Buddhism, the one-ness, yeah I bet Linklater could work with that.  

But he was also bitingly satirical and very, very funny, often in a mean (but necessary) way, and I don't think Linklater would know funny if it bit him in the ass.  Hicks deserves more than a Dazed and Confused reboot 15 years after a sound byte on a Tool album.  That's all this guy's got in the way of a cultural headstone and it's sad.

"Those are inexcusable quotes and to all the people who are beat up at rallies, roughed up, punched in the face, or have the crap knocked out of them can definitley look at Donald Trump as the aggressor and I would agree with them in that.

Sorry mate but that's simply not the reality that either of us live in. I understand that these may be perceived as calls to violence but its apples and oranges. Asking security to not be gentle when removing a protestor from his rally is simply not the same as these terroristic threats.

"Fun fact: The endothelium is impermeable to LDL, as LDL is too big. LDL can only be brought across the endothelium and glycocalyx when deliberately transported via LDL receptors/transcytosis. Ergo, concentration of LDL is not relevant as the rate is not determined by concentration, rather controlled by a deliberate mechanism. 

The only case under which LDL may cross the endothelium of its own volition is when it is damaged. But then it cannot be responsible for said damage. So whatever caused the damage must have been the actual cause.

Based on what background you pick you will start out with a different job (e.g., thief works for thieves guild, assassin work for their guild, mercenaries join the imperial guard, etc.) with different side quests.  But backgrounds are not exactly classes; technically the game is classless as you can build your character however you want and it may even be possible to switch to another profession sometimes based on choices you make.  


Anyway, you can think of the different backgrounds as taking place in parallel universes.  As the thieves guild is plotting a big heist the assassins are hired to assassinate an important figure  and so on.   You can complete all of the quests your guild gives you or just ignore sidequests altogether. Eventually all backgrounds will end up with essentially the same main quest of finding the ruins of an ancient temple."

"It's actually that partly due to China's foreign economic plan, almost all of an international postage rates' cost is government subsidized.

The UPU sets standards based on import vs. export quantities and since the last UPU negotiation their export of ""packets"" has increased exponentially. The small ""free shipping"" packets are actually classified as a lettermail product under the UPU's measurement framework, so they're credited at pennies on the dollar since they're using a loophole which was facilitated to move letters between countries for free, or very cheaply. Unfortunately each of these packets has to be inspected then sorted by hand, for free, by the recipient country. That's why the CBSA and Canada Post have no interest in clearing them quickly, they represent a black hole in manpower which doesn't return value to either group."

While your are right that a person doesn't have any responsibility to give up their own needs for the needs of another person, you are overlooking how the other person was put in a situation where they need you to survive. In the case of abortion due to rape, it is just as simple as the fetus not having the right to the person's needs, since the person was not responsible for putting the fetus in that position. In the case of abortion due to consensual sex, the person is directly responsible for putting the fetus in that position, and killing it would be like negligence resulting in manslaughter.

It is great to have faith and believe in a higher power rather than have a pessimisstic outlook that rely soley on facts and tangeble evidence. Now I am not saying to not believe in Science as it has helped us out tremendously in furthering our medical and technological fields but I also believe Science is a tool that was provided to us. To explore and better understand the world around us. But we like to view Science as a religion itself. Only believing in something because it is tangeble. That is the beauty of faith. Not knowing forsure but yet somehow, someway having a gut feeling something is looking over its creation.

Shipping being built in to the cost means you're probably going to overpay for shipping, or the seller's going to lose money.

"For Sale is a Tudor Black Bay Black with a Rose Dial.

These were a very limited run of only 3000 watches that was released before they moved to the in-house movement. This is slightly thinner than the in-house, which makes it a more wearable. Recently collectors and enthusiasts have been grabbing these up, so the price has been on the upward march and they’re getting harder to find. I see submariners on the subway everyday, and have yet to run into someone with another black bay black. I am located in NYC if you are local and want to make the exchange in person. 

This watch was boxed for about a year before I started to wear it. I take good care of it, as you can see, but it is used and has very mild wear as a result.

It comes with Box, Papers, Links, Tag, and the original purchase receipt. Absolutely complete in every way.

"I'm not really satisfied with their explanation as to why an opt-in survey of only their readers is valid for the population of all car users. They do mention those characteristics of their sampling, but I think the explanation and it's mitigating magnitude are too vague to be satisfactory for how big of an impact the factors could have. I have the same feeling for their mileage explanation. They said they standardize mileage, but I would like more assurance as to the sample size of higher mileage cars that are usually leased.

I also wished they were more detailed with the information they gave. Sure their reliability score is weighed based on how impactful the failures are, but I wish they separated the data based on like minor failures and stopping driving failure. Or I wish they factored cost into it since that's important in repairs, but I can see why they didn't because it's so varied."

"&gt;But now there is new information that may corroborate what the human sources quoted in the Fox article claimed about Seth’s role in getting the DNC documents to Wikileaks.  Borne from a FOIA request filed in November 2017 by attorney Ty Clevenger, who requested any information regarding Seth Rich and and Julian Assange. The NSA informed Clevenger in a letter dated 4 October 2018 that:

&gt;Your request has been processed under the provisions of the FOIA. Fifteen documents (32 pages) responsive to your request have been reviewed by this Agency as required by the FOIA and have found to be currently and properly classified in accordance with Executive Order 13526. These documents meet the criteria for classification as set forth in Subparagraph (c) of Section 1.4 and remains classified TOP SECRET and SECRET.

&gt;If NSA had come back and said, “No, we do not have anything pertaining to Seth Rich,” that would have been news. It would have been especially unwelcome news for those who believe that Seth was the source on the DNC emails. But now the opposite is true. The NSA says that it has documents that are classified TS and S. What do those documents say or prove? That remains to be seen.

As we know, Sy Hersh has indicated (in a secretly taped phone call with Ed Butowsky) that a trusted source inside the FBI told him that he had seen an FBI memo regarding an analysis of Seth's computer; this analysis allegedly found that Seth had provided the DNC emails to Wikileaks via dropbox.  This was the basis for the Fox News story which the Murdochs ordered withdrawn.  The response to Clevenger's FOIA request is at least consistent with the possibility that this story is accurate.  If Seth did not leak the emails, and if the FBI did not examine his computer (as has been claimed by the MSM), then why would they have 32 pages of classified documents on Rich?

A reasonable suspicion is that these secret documents describe not only an analysis of Seth's computer, but also describe Deep State surveillance which monitored Seth's communications with Wikileaks.  Which would explain why Guccifer 2.0 knew up front that Wikileaks was going to release DNC emails (Assange had not clarified what he wsa going to release, aside to state that is was ""Hillary related"") - and why Seth was targeted for murder.

"Of good moral character or of good spiritual character...
A person can hold high morality, based on commonly held views on morality or a person can use a biblical / spiritual view of good. 
The problem with using a biblical approach is that the Bible has multiple different laws that can be interpreted in a situation. Example: A good biblical , spiritual approach to the marriage has the wife subservient to the husband. Does a good Christian require the poor to work or does that Christian fed the poor regardless if the person works?

"Fear AND intensive indoctrination. 

There's certainly an element of fear in Muslim countries that if you don't accept the official dogma you could be fined, sent for ""re-education"" or worse, depending on what country. Where I live, one could very well expect a visit from the religious authorities for not toeing the official line on dogma. And while Salafism/Wahabbism in Malaysia are dirty words (the religious police can arrest suspected preachers of Wahabbism, the reality is that these religious police and the old government were decidedly Wahabbi-like in their policies and perspectives. Perhaps they started out wanting to avoid fundamentalism, but in the end, they ended up crushing progressivism and reform movements, and looking more and more fundamentalist each day themselves.

The other problem is indoctrination. I'm not talking about the transmission of religion by parents to their children, but state-sponsored formal religious education. Both my kids go to government schools and religion is pervasive throughout the curriculum. I'd estimate that about 30% of the overt curriculum is dedicated to religion (two subjects: one specifically on religion, the other being Arabic studies, although that's really just about learning to read the Qur'an). 

On the one hand, having a government curriculum on religion might help to avoid fundamentalism, depending on the content of that curriculum. But at the end of the day, it really depends on the messages that the child is receiving from the teachers, the school culture, the parents, and wider society. Religious studies teachers are usually more conservative than the courses they teach. For example, we've seen a growth in women wearing niqab here in Malaysia, despite there being little evidence within the sources of Islam (the Qur'an and the Sunnah) to support the niqab. And the religious studies teachers aren't doing enough to discourage girls from wearing these facial veils."

"Yup, exactly, apart from encryption, I found no mention of such feature in the ACRE manual, I don't think ACRE simulates that, and the walkie-talkie type radios in the game don't even have any option to set that up either. The only feature that comes close is the ""babel"" which garbles communication from other sides to simulate foreign language, but that was not the case. Besides, it wouldn't make any sense for the radios to not work out of the box on the same side or for the mission maker to specifically disable that either.

Specifically, we were using the idiotically simple [AN/PRC-343](http://acre2.idi-systems.com/wiki/radios/an-prc-343) which doesn't even provide any other options apart from channel and block switching and volume control.

Direct speech works constantly, radios work only when in same squad, in that case they work wonderfully and the signal simulation is great. The problems started only when we introduced more than one squad to the formula."

"Well kakashi didnt just get trapped by zabuza. Kakashi flexed all over zabuza by copying his ninjutsu and blasting him to hell. Then fought him again on the bridge and really proved his strength as a ninja. 

Kakashi also did skirmish with itachi during that interaction before itachi used one of his strongest techniques to end things. 

Konohamarus fight was more like itachi vs kakashi. His technique got matched and then he got one shotted. Except bc it was so short in the manga konohamaru still appeared pretty useless where kakashi still appeared to be giving it his all.

There is no equivalent for zabuza with konohamaru, konohamaru hasnt been able to flex on anything

Not to mention kakashi fell when his student, naruto was still safe in the company of jiraiya, whereas konohamaru fell and left his squad more or less wide open. 

Now konohamaru getting saved by his student is similar to the zabuza thing but when kakashi was freed from zabuzas water prison he went back to fighting zabuza. Konohamaru just stayed taking the L."

The fact that BO4 doesn't have any dedicated servers is why I'm having this issue. This is why I'm annoyed. The fact that the game uses a P2P system means that the NAT security levels of all the users must be synced for the game to be able to be played together by two peers. However, the issue seems to be deeper than that because even though my NAT levels are open (and as are my friends, as I assume since I could play with them before) I become unable to play with my friends at later dates.

Also, from what  I know, Overwatch does have dedicated servers for custom lobbies too, but that's ENTIRELY besides my point. If it was just those that you needed to port forward to, I couldn't care any less.

All I want you to explain to me is why BO4 is the one game that requires people to directly port forward a specific port, when no other game in 2018 requires this?"

And fair enough there, I suppose you are right. The items ARE interesting, I just don't find a lot of it useful at all and the armour/weapons materials limited. I'm surprised at that too considering my character is quite well-rounded, I would assume EVERYTHING would help, since he likes melee, marksmanship, and magic all at once.

"&gt;How much people actually want it.

But isn't that calculation yet another calculation of the labor time the consumer must spend to purchase the commodity? It seems like you're assuming the LVT is wrong and then saying ""see, it's wrong"". Critical Fragmentation has a decent write-up:

&gt;But when I pay for the diamond, I am making a value judgment of the diamond by agreeing that the diamond is worth the money to pay for it, and more importantly the amount of work I put in to make that money. **So the value of the diamond comes from labor not because the consumer considers the diamond as valuable as the value of the labor that it took to create the diamond, but because by agreeing to purchase the diamond the consumer is agreeing that the diamond is as valuable as the work it took to be able to pay for it.** Ergo, the value the diamond comes from labor but not necessarily the labor it took to create the diamond but rather the value judgment that the consumer makes every time he consents that the price of a good is equal or less than the amount of labor it takes to pay that price.

Honestly I can't tell if this just shows that all of these value theories are largely unfalsifiable."

"Ah, apologies.  Of course, I thought you were one of those whom I have to resist referring to as Neantherthals, *because it would be insulting to Neantherthals*.

If you use off the excess protein before your brain and body decides “hmm... extra protein, time to grow more” - then your cancer risk should stay the same or go down.

It will be something else that’s problematic.  Meat does not promote as much gut bacterial biodiversity as plants.  Cause no “fiber”.

Dietary fiber is what turns our gut flora into a jungle or coral reef of biodiversity.  The more bacterial species in your gut, the more types of food you can actually digest and so the more nutrient diversity.

Fiber rich food gives like 4x more nutrient diversity than fiberless food.

*Also, I’m like willing to bet that the bacteria also eat each other..., adding to the nutrient mix*.  Isn’t reality grand?  We can get our very own so wild ecosystem food processing factory right in our very gut.

Btw, this is like so common sense to me that you will have to “ask” me for the research about it.  Any attempts at arguing over it will just have me directing you to the sciencedaily article I posted somewhere in this discussion about a theory suggesting that Neantherthals went extinct cause their diet not as diverse as Modern Humans."

"That's a bummer, OP. Really sucks.  
What about your, Dad? Did he help you at all? Does he have anything to say? I expect you would inherit everything he has? I don't know why you mom left all her money to your sister, but she is just one imperfect woman, with quite a bit of problems. Don't let it bring your down.  
Maybe your mom felt that she had to compensate to your sister for growing up with no father? Maybe it was something of a bystander effect, since she shared you with your dad (and felt she could relax a bit), but your sister was mostly her responsibility, and she ended up overdoing it? Maybe your sister isn't doing as well as you think? Or maybe your mother thought that your sister really needs all the help she can get to get through this life, while you are doing well on your own? Squeaky wheel gets the grease and all that.  
Also 10 years is a long time. Sometimes family's fortune changes, they become more successful or loose their money, parents become addicted to drugs and alcohol or clean up their act. And children born during a good part get college and cars and perfect childhood, but children born during bad periods get nothing at best. Your mom clearly had some emotional problems, marriage problems, alcoholism. It's entirely possible you and your sister were basically raised by 2 different women. It has nothing to do with you, she just changed. And probably tried to wear her ""old self mask"" in front of the older daughter, and then was her more real current self around you.

No it isn't. Not always, not if something changes... This is derivatives 101, do you even math? Like seriously, are you sure you're mathematically literate?

If you wanna find what is the biggest threat NOW, you don't look at deaths for the last 200 years and go , ""Woah, we gotta watch out for those Germans!"" FFS.

If the situation changes, then a wider range will give you a worse result for the present. Are you seriously not able to get that?

&gt;It's a shame you have been unable to find any studies that support your wildly inaccurate statements. I wonder why that is? ;)

Your study, literally your study supports my statement. There is no why on my part, YOU are the weakest link here, you are the one who fails to understand the argument.

Edit:

To explain it a bit better, it works like this. For a constant model, as in one that doesn't change, Yes more samples can allow us to define it's parameters better. However that assumes it has constant parameters, if something suddenly changes, then that model doesn't apply anymore, and to approximate the variables of that model a smaller time interval will likely be superior.

For instance if you have 10 deaths since 1995 so 22 years from our reference, then suddenly after Trump gets elected you have 13 left wing deaths in 2016-2017 gap. Which happens to be the year Trump won. It is far more likely that the model changed. 

Sure given more time we can get a more accurate picture of this new model, but that doesn't mean our old data should be included."

"Hunter and Warlock are both in a bit of bad spot right now (Hunter without rexxar and WL without Guldan in April? Ded much) but to be fair, those two decks are indeed highly interactive. Before the nerfs I had a lovely tempo rogue that I built myself and these were my favorite matchups because we ground each other down with insane trade combo interactions until we were both in Leeroy / Ziliax-heal-and-taunt-roadblock territory from behind which the final blow could and would be delivered, so we tried to taunt and threaten our way around the different win conditions of the opponent constantly. And not 20 mana 84 damage combo win conditions with stalling endlessly before; 4 damage from hand + fungalmancer (if ordered correctly!) win conditions. The way the plays happened in succession really showed that we both knew what’s up without needing to see each other’s hands.

So yeah I mean when you have super shitty draw and face that gg, I get that, it happens. But I cannot bring myself to hate on that class/archetype combo each and that matchup overall. Wouldn’t mind playing a round of that right now...

"Possibly Spoiler theory,  if you have played Torna the Golden Country,  theirs a cutscene with Amalthus and Darth Sidious looking guy talking about human DNA and a Blades DNA that they are exactly the same. Then It shows a Titans DNA and like how much they look almost entirely the same but theirs about a third more of the DNA that makes it bigger. But the Darth Sidious looking guy then explains that core crystals collect data DNA from every living thing and when a blades dies, reverts back to a core crystal and then says evolution stuff,  Titans give birth to life in general, humans then resonate with core crystal and bond/give life to blades, then after blades so many times of be resonated with turns into a Titans. Gramps also has a conversation with Jin about that. Hope this helps.

Unfortunately, the first minor frost has hit, so any grower with acres of plants will have already picked their last peppers and they'll be lower quality.  August and September are the best time to get super hots and it's best to get it from the farmer, rather than at markets, since peppers for markets are picked early to prevent early rotting.  Many generalist farmers around here also don't realize how long it takes a red super hot to go from red to peak ripeness.  It's really a color matching game.

"You could dark souls that shit up man! Invading in that game is all about jumping into another player's world to kill them in a more ruthless pvp style than other games.

Although each game has flaws in the pvp aspect (but what game doesn't), being an invader can very much be about skill (and a bit of luck). Rings to use, weapons for which situation, dealing with when the person you are invading summons other players to help him, setting up ambushes or using mobs as a distraction, there are plenty of things to think about and do to be an effective invader.

There is also straight up pvp in the game in the form of an arena or having people summon you to duel. Each game does the former differently. 

I found dark souls 3 to have better pvp experience than 1. Never played 2 but I hear it is by far the best for a pvp experience."

"**+ImSmaher ""You started off citing that documentary, which made me think you believed them. So I told you they were dead wrong. But anywho, I don’t know what “heyday” is either. You didn’t make that clear.""**

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies for the misunderstanding, I only cited the documentary in relation to information on the timeline of the stabbing, NOT Slenderman's history/influence as a character. I referenced it for Geyser &amp; Weier, nothing more.

&amp;#x200B;

And, from what I've found across multiple sources covering the case itself, the documentary's info. on that was pretty accurate. To clarify once more, I used the term ""heyday"" in relation to the peak of Slenderman's popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

That measurement of the years in which he attracted the most attention (to the original stories and **Slender** games) was based on the other sources/videos I'd consulted. That was NOT based at all on the documentary's material.

&amp;#x200B;

**""When I say Slender Man’s 'true' or 'actual' character, I mean the collection of stories that were around before the series and games that treated him completely different. In those stories, the creators basically didn’t stray too far off from the** ***original*** **original stories by Victor Surge.""** Yes, I get that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was more criticizing your language in using terms like ""true"" or ""actual"" because that can easily be taken as a ""No true Scotsman"" argument. This is an easy intellectual trap to fall into and I only wanted to point that out.

&amp;#x200B;

It's totally fine to differentiate between contemporary vs original Slenderman, I agree with that. But choosing to articulate that distinction as what's ""true"" or ""actual"" can fundamentally undermine your position.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes ""true"" Slenderman to you won't be the same for every fan of the original. Basically, my intention wasn't to argue against what you said but more the WAY you said it, as that's important in context for consistency's sake.

&amp;#x200B;

**""He** ***did*** **sometimes make people disappear and that’d be it. But that would mainly and only just be children. For example, a picture of a child or children with Slender Man in the background. The story behind it would be that that child is suddenly gone. But of course yeah, that wasn’t a staple to his character.""**

&amp;#x200B;

Right, I remember now. Thanks for correcting me on that. I'm sorry if it feels like we've been talking in circles but it does sound like we mostly share common ideas for what can make a proper **Slenderman** film work. This was fun!"

"Yes, quite normal. 

One tip is to salvage white gear from Armor/Weapon racks throughout the game. Some maps like Act 1 Prison, Halls of Agony and Act 5 Battlefield of Eternity will have a lot of racks.

Use cube (#7 I think) with 1 db and 1 yellow gear to convert 100 white mat/salvage to 100 yellow mat. 

1 white gear provides \~7 white mat where as 1 yellow gear provides 1 yellow mat, you are looking at \~110 white mat vs 30 yellow for a full inventory salvage.

Normal rifts will run these 3 maps quite often, so you can just pick em up there.

I only pick up yellow gear that I want to upgrade to legendaries via cube like weapons, rings or necklaces.

It's a bit more efficient on the long run and you won't need to tp back mid rift to salvage all the yellow gear. "

"Look, I can't tell you whether you should break up or not, because you know your boyfriend and your relationship and I do not. It sounds from your post like you don't think this is something that you can work through from your previous experiences in this relationship. It does not sound like he treats you especially well from your posts.

&amp;#x200B;

Your first paragraph though, these are not good reasons to stay in a relationship. I am also 26 and I broke up with my ex of 7 years for other reasons, but actually, we had some similar problems with my libido being lower than his and me feeling like he wasn't doing all that much to make me want to have sex with him. Now I've got some distance from the situation, I can see that this is very much not something I would have wanted to put up with for the rest of my life. And actually, 4 months on, it turned out that my libido is just fine, the issue was my drive to have sex with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes it does suck breaking up with a long term partner. I'm a little financially worse off, I live in a shared house instead of in a nice flat with just my partner, and my parents were upset. But I know I absolutely made the right choice and I would do it again in a second. Breaking up now might upend your lives, but if you don't, can you live with this forever? Assume he doesn't change - is breaking up for the same reason going to be any less painful after another 5 years? Consider that in another 5 years, you might very well have gotten married + /- bought a house +/- had kids, and you may well feel like you've wasted 5 years you could have spent with someone more compatible with you."

"It's just being human. We're not Vulcans after all, we have emotions. It makes us incredibly complex creatures. If you read on the news that a car-bomb exploded in Bulawayo and killed a group of kids, you'll probably shrug it off, ignore it, not even stop to find out where the hell that is. If you hear that your son got in a car accident and is in hospital with a fractured wrist, you'll rush right down there in a panic. You have a far stronger connection with your son. It's also more immediate.  


Same with dogs. Many people keep them as pets and form strong emotional attachment to them. When they see a dog suffering right in front of them it triggers that connection. Not many people have strong connections with cows, and their slaughter goes on behind closed doors and at a distance. The connections and immediacy just aren't there.

"But that's like the only argument ppl have against Discord. ""They sell your data""

Yeah.. what data? My online nickname and all the memes I posts? Good luck with selling that. And in times where ppl don't even care about facebook loses millions of real user data (real names, real adreses, real photos) then I personally are okay with the fact that some chinese company knows that I played game X at Monday and Friday from 16-22 and was in voice with user A B and C. And posted those 7 memes/youtube videos. Used 15 bots commands and logged in from country X with IP Y.

Google and Facebook know way more shit about me than that. And its way harder to avoid Facebook and Google, because they even track you through third parties/ads or via your friend or contact list.

But well... maybe other ppl give their real data and real email-adreses and link every possible account to Discord. But if you don't do that and use it somewhat ""anonymously"" then I really don't see the TeamSpeak advantage over Discord anymore. And I still host 2 paid TeamSpeak server for my community :D

"You have to make a decision when it comes to the story of the mod. You can't have both the left and the right be on the whole good without being incoherent, because they have irreconcilable views of reality. You can have exceptions, can have ""Anti-Klan Long and SocDem Feds are the best of the systems they represent""...but you still have to say one of those systems is better than the others or else not have a story that makes sense.

Kaiserreich has pretty much always been to the left of things in terms of moral judgement. It's literally the most popular work of media related to syndicalism."
"That makes sense. Perhaps “scared” was too strong of a word, and something like anxious or apprehensive would have been better. However you label it, I can’t help but notice that you’re here on your own trying to figure out how to talk to your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns with the relationship, as if this is your problem to solve, and one that you can solve on your own. 

The fact remains that having calm, productive discussions requires your wife’s cooperation, and in order to get that, she’d need to a) acknowledge that you guys have communication issues, and b) agree to work with you on solving those issues, which includes being accountable for her contribution to the communication issues in the relationship. Do you think she’s capable of doing those things and working with you to solve your problems? If not, how do you propose to have a calm and productive conversation with her? 

My first suggestion would be to ignore the histrionics, ignore the tears, ignore the deflection and stonewalling, and make your voice heard. If that doesn’t work, or you’ve already tried it with little success, the next step would be couples counseling. If that fails or she refuses to go, then you’re kind of out of options. If you can’t get her on board, then this is the way it’s going to be."

"It’s all very well to cry “what about” but you’re ignoring the inconsistency of reddit, to condemn other violent acts, committed by Democrat supporters. Whoever sent these bombs is a violent, misguided asshole. Whoever sent the ricin to the Whitehouse a few weeks ago, also a violent misguided asshole. 

Can you just TRY to acknowledge that the latter had almost no coverage on these parts of reddit, and by reading this thread, the top comments would all suggest this behaviour comes only from one side?

People on the right only want consistency on reddit. That’s why ‘what about’ happens. And comments like yours attempt to sweep away the glaring obvious fact: all political parties have crazy people. 

It’s so frustrating that it should be a controversial point. Nobody is clean, and everybody should condemn their own crazies, the same way we all condemn the others’. "

If you the chip is proprietary then it is likely have the code dump functionality disabled. You don’t want everyone to be able to reverse engineer your code, or sell your product without loyalty. 

The protocol to flash the micro controller is not included in the datasheet and you need to contact the maker of the chip to get it. This strongly suggests that you can’t really develop your own programmer/dumper. 

Overall, it is pretty unfeasible.

"I thought BFA content was good. However, the class/gear mechanics and implementation is by far the worst. I thought I hated Legion's RNG legendary system, but BFA takes the cake as the worst, mechanically.

The removal of tier sets, the terrible implementation and balance among azerite gear, the lack of talent diversity (for some classes, talent balances are way off the charts), the Diablo|POE-like level of RNG gearing etc. It's things they can fix but they are extremely stubborn in fixing them. There are *some* signs of them moving in the right direction in PTR, but it's still a far, far road in reaching the destination."

"Given the homogenization of a lot of classes, this is probably related to visibility of the races in game.  Someone mentioned that most of the top streamers play horde which probably pulls people on the fence, or new people, to that faction. I would love to see the numbers for accounts with a life of greater than 6-8 years as late Cata/early MoP was probably the last time that you could say Horde had a flat advantage in racial design.  Most people who are heavily invested stick with one side or risk losing years of progress even though things like mounts, appearances, and achievements are now account wide except for some very specific examples (sunken cost fallacy).  

Class identity in this game is mostly gone.  Progression guilds look at certain classes for the one or two things they bring situationally, but there is still a plethora of evidence that nearly any class/spec will work for almost every encounter across all difficulties (except shaman, rip).  

It’s only going to get worse, as people are still playing the “X class has ability Z, why can’t I?” card, resulting in further homogenization until the only distinguishing traits will be Melee or Ranged DPS, Tanks, and Healers, with little variance between them.  "

"Why do you suppose that PR would grant them a bigger voice? Do you have any data that substantiates this claim? Most of the research I have seen supports the basic premise that PR results in an increase of party polarization, but that because the polarization is spread across the political spectrum (i.e. you're just as likely to have anarchists who promote the abolishing of borders as you are those who are completely against immigration) the net result is a more moderate government, that is less responsive to fringe groups and perspectives ([i.e. this 2006 article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316688438_Does_Proportional_Representation_Foster_Closer_Congruence_Between_Citizens_and_Policy_Makers)). Just look to Ontario where they have recently repealed sex ed curriculum because of the echo chamber of conservatives that resulted in Ford's election under FPTP.

"I completely agree. I've felt for every game since II (with the exception of black flag) that at the end of the story line I cant remember what happened or even what characters I had interacted with aside from the gratuitous historical character shoe-ins (lookin at you Ben Franklin and Charles Dickens). I felt like every target in these games was around for one section before I killed them, never long enough to develop or make an impression. I dont even know why I killed them other than that was what the game said to do.

Odyssey is a refreshing break from this pattern in that the characters I'm hunting have a chance to establish themselves before I murder them. It's a cast improvement in storytelling and it makes the game have a more memorable impact."

Recently I bought my first car, a 1997 Clio. It has been in a shed for the past 5 years maybe so it was pretty dirty.

After I picked it up I was going back home and while I was doing around 40 on a deserted road close to my house this big freaking spider came down from the sun visor dangling from it's web.

The second I saw it the very second I saw it I passed a speed bump and the spider fall from it's string of web right on my lap and up the inside of my shirt it went.

I almost panicked and ran into a tree but instead I pulled over making the first brake check that little Clio has had in years got out of it and proceeded to take out my shirt.

All before my girlfriends eyes which where dripping tears from the burst of laughter she was having...

So yeah... If you buy an old car and fear spiders make sure to clean it a little bit before taking it home..."

"Agreed and we also can't forget that, at least in his rookie year, Frederick was helping Dak with presnap coverage reads. Frederick is a true student if the game and we're missing that.

I also think Daks lack of ability at QB is forcing Linehan to be overly creative just to give him easier reads and is all together shrinking the playbook.

At the end of the day, while I would like to move on from Garrett and Linehan, there are far worse coaches out there. But people act like their presence alone is causing Dak to be inaccurate and the o-line to not be blocking well and the receivers to not be very good. At the end of the day, it comes down to the talent you have on the field. 

Not every play can be this mastermind play call. At some point you have to be able to just call inside zone or basic passing concepts and trust your talent to execute."

"Here I'll write this for you both (paging /u/arrogant_ambassador )

Not that many years ago I was at Richard Dawkins conference hanging out with atheists. She was raised Reform and I started looking into it about the time we were getting married and I made a family discovery showing that I was 1/4 ethnically Ashkenazi. 

I mainly wanted to connect with her over it and learn about my new history. We started going to Friday Night/Erev Shabbat services pretty regularly and then started taking classes on 'Intro to Judaism' at that location to learn more together. We started going to their Shabbat morning Torah study as well. 

We did that for a few years and I kept reading and researching on my own, I started to feel like Halakah made sense and should be included in Judaism. This was probably the turning point. I made friends with a fellow veteran who was with his wife were becoming BT, he grew up very Chassidic (grandfather was actually in Satmar but they ""shunned"" him for marrying a Sefardi) his grandfather wrote a Hagaddah that was edited by Mordechai Kaplan (founder of Reconstructionist Judaism), amusingly. And his wife was kinda more a punk with no real attachment to religion, closer to how I was. 

Anyway, my friend loves to study Zohar more than Halakah and he sometimes does things more because he recalls doing them but dosen't know really the why or what. Like he can quote Dov Bear but can't tell you why a Tablet K hechsher is bad. (This bit becomes more relevant later)

Anyway, I eventually started going to the Conservative Schul in town and kinda checking out the MO schul, this is the point where she kinda freaked out. She assumed things that my buddy was doing (like getting his wife to cover her hair) and various other things. So she made some assumptions about how life was going to turn out and she started hanging out at clubs till 3-4 in the morning. 

I converted Conservative since that was really as high as I could go with her only being paternal. I then started taking Melton school's 2-year program and the local MO Rabbi was an instructor. I talked to him a lot about how 'O' thought of things and it helped because he was younger, and also a veteran. So I started getting closer and closer to the O side of the house. 

She had when she was younger followed a bunch of bands around and she also played bass guitar. When I started playing violin I convinced her to start playing bass again. So she started going out and handing out with all these local bands, who happened to be all guys. 

Once she got drunk at a party and started getting handsy with one of them and that was about a year ago now and that was pretty much the down slide of the relationship. She refused to go to counseling, and we agreed that we should get a divorce at the start of the year, although she waited until after I took her on a trip to Israel, amazingly.

Anyway, now 1 wife down, sold a house, now living in the eruv, shomer Shabbat/negiah/kashrut and working on a conversion through the Chicago Rabbininc Council, about 4-5 months into that process.  

Let me know if you have more questions, hard to really think of all of it at the moment, still trying to get the house sold and paying for two places at the moment so my brain is just worn out these days.

Title: **What constitues as Retailiation in the work place?**

Original Post: 

&gt; Had to report unfair treatment / procedures not followed at my work to HR.  Short summery i work at a call center, a coworker asked to switch shifts and i said im not sure. Since she has the team lead wrapped around her fingers he then sent an email and demanded i cover the shift.
&gt; 
&gt; Facts:  This request off was not made 2 weeks prior as per company policy / guidelines.  
&gt; 
&gt; Lead did not formally ask to cover the shift for approved time off.
&gt; ------------
&gt; This request for time off is not for family sake or other emergency.  HR said if it was known about event procedures should have been followed.
&gt; 
&gt; However that situation turns out is soon to be discovered tomarrow.  But what would constitute as retailation in future events.
&gt; Can my schedule be changed ?  Should i not be entitled to request my owed time off in the future without incident?

they can make agreements, try to violate them in secret, and if they get caught to re impose sanctions is much more difficult.  As time goes on there is less and less oversight and imposing sanctions is more and more difficult.  All the while iran continues to develop nuclear technology.

IF iran in truth wishes to develop nuclear technology this is a great deal for them, they get a ton of money, continue research, and oversight dwindles away to the point in 15 years where it is 'scouts honor'.

What it comes down to is if we want to trust iran, to believe they don't want nuclear weapons.  If they completely abandoned their nuclear program they would receive a ton of economic benefits, they are not willing to do it.

"&gt; I could just level up by playing normally.

Your definition of normal is not going to be the same as everyone else's. I can probably say with 99% confidence that those struggling get through Origins/Odyssey took issue with how the game gated them every other mission to get exp and that the side content required to gain said exp was nowhere up to snuff in production and interesting content to the main ones and hence very tedious to do."

"I don't mind casual sex, but short-term relationships seem to be more fun for me. Casual sex feels so detached - ""here's a hot girl/guy I can rub ugly bits with cause it feels good"".

I prefer a little more depth. I want to enjoy the company of a person, as well as the pleasure we create together. One night stands sort of feel like I'm missing out. That being said, I've had a few. I'm just very open to a second date.

I'm now happily engaged, and wouldn't swap my partner for all the women in the world. I just sometimes miss having someone new to get to know like that.

My advice is enjoy some fun when you're young, don't get into a relationship until you're ready, but when you meet someone you click with, don't be afraid to make it something more."

"Both good points, but personally, so I have no actual evidence, they seem to be treated differently because the populations of Christian and Islamic countries carry out their religious practices (adherence to them) with massively different levels of adherence. In the 13th century Europeans adhered to Catholicism much more strictly and modern Islamic countries adhere to Islam much more strictly. Some Islamic countries, like Iran, are even run by religious leaders. The higher level of adherence to both the positive and negative aspects of the religion by the majority is Muslims seperates them from Christians in discussions regarding each religion. Out of curiosity, can you point me to an example of an Islamic majority country that does not oppress the minority religions?"

It disappears because Batman now knows that Joker is truly beyond redemption and rehabilitation and that there’s no point in trying to help him. The very last panel of the book is identical to the first—this represents the fact that Batman and Joker’s conflict is cyclical, and will never end, which is a theme explored in the story.

"[Victus (Barcelona 1714)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victus), by Albert Sánchez Piñol. [Translated as ""Victus, the fall of Barcelona""] It's mainly the history of the Spanish War of Succession, told through a hilarious fictional character whom somehow ended up in every key moment.

Plus: If anyone has any appreciation for warfare under that era, maybe 80% of the book is about that. The main character is an engineer whose studies under Vauban are the first part of the book. It's great knowledge on these typical european fortifications, you'll learn how they were built and why, which was their purpose, how they were assaulted or not, etc.

It's an awesome, awesome book. Can't find the list of translations now, but I think that among English, it's in German and Dutch minimum (the Dutch presentation was actually cancelled in Utretch in 2014, due to the Spanish embassy pressures, so you have that plus of excitement of reading something that a country doesn't want you to read)."

Unlike feh, this game actually has a steady flow of unique events (at least so far)  and plenty of content. 

Leveling units in feh is easy, and there’s relatively little grind. This is a double edged sword: too little grind like feh means long term goals barely exist, aside from praying to rng for 10 merges. Too much grind burns out players. I feel DL strikes a decent balance here."

"My first solo trip was last August. I was planning this trip with my friends but they bailed last minute. I remember thinking to hell with this and decided to just l travel solo.

I was suuuuuuper nervous since it was the first time I had traveled by myself but I ended up having a blast. I made some nice friends, visited some cool sites in Barcelona and I am genuinely proud of myself for doing this since i'm a bit of a reserved person.

There were some akward moments here and there like when I ate alone in a restaurant but overall I was really happy.

Some of my fav moments were:

1. Walking in the city at night and randomly ronding a woman singing opera songs.
2. Visiting the amazing Sagrada Familiale church.
3. Having conversations and fun with other tourists I met while sightseeing (10 years ago I was too shy to have ever done this).
4. Going to the top of a mountain and just laying on the grass and enjoying the weather.


I remember halfway through my trip thinking: If I was at home right now i'd either be on my laptop or doing something else tedious. I am so happy I traveled solo."

"&gt; You have been misinformed about your history. The Trojan War is thought to have happened, but not as it did Illiad at all (as it stands historians don't even agree that it happened). Achilles as a historical person? Well that's unlikely. So yes, fictional person. 

Achilles and the Trojan War were real things that actually happened. As for all the mythological son of a god mumbo jumbo... probably nonsense. But it was based on a real person and a real event. Though a lot of people seem really polarized about it.

Whatever the case, dude was Greek.

There are Hittite documents that have been found thought to refer to the Trojan Wars:

&gt; ""Remarkable discoveries in central Turkey have lead to the decipherment of the Hittite language and have revealed the existence of a great empire which stretched from the Aegean to the Euphrates valley at the precisely the time when more likely the Trojan War occurred. In the Hittite archives we have thus real historical texts to interpret: diplomatic letters, treaties, annals and royal autobiographies where the relationship between the Hittite empire and their neighbors (places and populations) are often described. Several Hittite tables make reference to the city or the area of Wilusa one time also associated with the name Taruwisa (*4). This city was located in the Assuwa country in the North western area of Anatolia. This area was involved in some conflict with the under expansion Hittite empire. The Hittite king Tudhaliya I (Late 15th-Mid 14th BC) defeated some of the local population which were absorbed into the Hittite kingdom, while other countries remain independent even if under the Hittite political influence. For the above mentioned phonetic laws of Greek the name Ilios was before Homer Wilios which is phonetically comparable with the Hittite form Wilusa. Furthermore, even if the name Taruwisa can't be fully phonetically associated with the Greek Troia the similitude is at least reasonable. The city of Wilusa under the Hittite King Muwattalli II (about 1290-1272 BC) become what the Hittite called ""soldier servant"" that is a Hittite vassal state with military responsibilities and with a promise of Hittite military protection in return. (the Hittite tablets also mentioned Wilusa troops/chariots fighting in the Qadesh battle of 1274 BC). Following the Hittite tablets description and comparing them with some archaeological evidences it is now possible to connect Wilusa with the city excavated in the Hisarlik hill traditionally identified as the Homeric Troy.""

&gt; Okay. To put this in perspective, you're upset that they decided to be more openly diverse all at once. You're saying that you're okay with diversity-but this is too much diversity? By that standards a show can never do something bold, they always have to be limited because they don't want to upset people for being 'too diverse'. Entertainments creativity should never be limited because of others' insecurities. 

Over diversifying for the sake of diversifying is actually a form of entitlement. Take all the stink about the Oscars a few years back, saying not enough black people had won. Looking at it from a non-emotional perspective, roughly 10% of Oscars have gone to black people while around 12% of the population are black. Close enough to be within the margin of error. So to then complain that they're not getting more when by percentage of population it's a rough equivalence of what they're entitled to... is entitlement.

&gt; I am not saying that the BBC didn't have intentions behind those decisions-but they were intentions I agree with and at their core there is nothing wrong with them at all. The BBC wants to represent their audience better and they want to probably make up for past exclusion

So by what you're suggestion, you would posit that let's say Doctor + old man + black kid + pakistani police girl represents an about 50% white, 25% black, 25% pakistani population in the UK?

Let's look at numbers. It seems there's an 87.2% white population, 3% black population, and if we combine Indian at 2.3% and Pakistani at 1.9% that's around 4.2%. So proportional representation? I think not.

This is something I see people complain a lot about which has no real factual basis. From a business standpoint a business will want to cater to their largest consumer base. Why waste money targeting a consumer base that doesn't exist disproportionately?

In the case of the US and UK, that's white. Which, by simple business sense, is why most advertisements and such are targeted towards such. It's also why proportionally roles are predominantly white.

So in truth, it's really a non-issue. The true issue is that the film industry isn't well established in predominantly black countries like in  Africa. Though you see in Asian countries this is quite a different story. China, India, Japan, Korea, and so on have their own industries. Though they rarely bleed over into the Western mainstream. Secondarily it becomes a population issue, back to the business standpoint.

As for making up for past exclusions? While contrived, it's possible it's what they're attempting.

And no, I'm not ""upset that they decided to be more openly diverse all at once.""

&gt; If you had loved the first few episodes you wouldn't have complained at all-

Correct. Though for the wrong reasons.

&gt; but you are looking for some reason the show doesn't match up to your standards and it's because the companions are too diverse?

I'm not looking for reasons. They're being constantly thrown in our face. It's called pandering, and it's super obvious to anyone that bothers to pay a modicum of attention. And over the top pandering is what annoys me. It actually has nothing to do with racial diversity.

Though, I suspect you won't understand that."

"FYI-your experience might not be like mine, which I undertook back in 2011. 

I talked with several VA people about what bothers me most, I think about 3 or 4 at different times. The first few didn't go into detail and weren't noteworthy.  The whole process took a while, but it's because I moved across the country.

My first appointment was in Savannah. It went fucking awful. The older lady couldn't give two shits about me being there. It lasted about 15 min.  In that 15 min young kids burst into the office and distracted the lady for about 5 minutes. I assume they were her grandkids.

Second was with an Army captain. He was more matter-of-fact, no sympathy, just another evaluation about vague topics. 

Third was with a female civilian who was middle aged and was a physicians assistant I think. I bawled my eyes out with no warning. That was the last time I cried like that and it felt really good. I didn't even cry over anything specific.

Then I moved from Savannah to San Diego, slowing my process.

My final one, which turned into therapy, went into way more detail about a single event and was with the VA. Every time I came back for therapy I was asked about the same event and I recounted the same thing over and over. This went on for about 8 weeks. I was recorded every time. MAJOR shout out to that therapist at the San Diego VA.

Just as noted by others, if you're telling the truth your story will always be straight and believed. I'm not a psychologist, but I imagine if someone were forcing emotions, like crying, or was inconsistent, those are red flags. 

I'm up for reevaluation this year and am not sweating a thing because I will never forget my experiences in Iraq.

She got stressed, and just left. You know what happened? I was at work until 4 in the morning doing her job for her. What, you think I didn't get stressed? you think I didn't just want to say ""fuck this, I'm out"" and leave? I did, but I have responsibilities, and I would have been held at a higher standard because I am a man. 

I remember one woman, this was when I was 16 and working at mini grocery store. she got upset over something, stat right in front of the cash and started crying. I had customers tell me ""what the fuck did you do to her? Tell me or I'm going to call the police"".

"&gt; As an aspiring author myself, I can't help but feel that it affects me when I write, which results self-applied censorship on my part. I realize that it's not ill intended at all, but it nonetheless feels overbearing at times, sometimes even resulting in me changing entire character arcs.

How vague. Was what you changed problematic or not? Did you sit down and give some serious thought to what you wanted to write and saw things that framed the story in a way that could be misconstrued or were actually shitty and then change it? Or did you just change things because someone might find them offensive?

Also, what's the problem with self-""censorship""? AKA having a filter and maybe realizing that being a writer/artist doesn't automatically mean you are the most qualified to explore/cover a topic. To quote Craig Ferguson: ""Does this NEED to be said? Does this need to be said by ME? Does that need to be said by me NOW?""

There are topics that are sensitive, deeply personal, even traumatic to quite a few people and seeing these topics handled badly will of course create at the very least a negative opinion of your work, if not anger. No one says that writing about something like this is easy, and when you take them on you *have* to be prepared to treat these things with respect and be prepared to maybe still fuck them up.

In general, a good advice is to read examples of what you want to write about from people with first hand experience. Afraid your non-white characters might be offensive caricatures? Read books by non-white authors (and hey, maybe read up what exactly it is they criticize about problematic books - there might be a pattern there). Want to tackle abuse? Read books by abuse-survivors and non-fiction about abusive relationships. Want to make sure your female character doesn't ""breast boobily to the stairs, and titties downward""? Read books by female authors.

The key is introspection and the ability to take a step back from your work and to evaluate it critically. I assure you you have unexamined biases and blind spots that can creep into your writing which you might not know about. I'll leave you with an example from one of my favorite TED talks, covering something what a book labeled ""problematic"" for having no minority characters might be criticized of. (It's really great, look it up).

In Chimamanda Adiche's The Danger of A Single Story she recalls her realization she had when she was young, that she, a little black girl from Nigeria who'd in her life had never even seen snow only wrote stories about little white boys named Harry playing in the snow. Because that's what all the books that were available to her depicted. The idea that books *could* be about little black Nigerian girls was something she had to learn. So maybe you see why some people are pretty adamant about having more non-white characters. Because at the end of a thousand read books not showing people like you, you might end up believing that Harry playing in the snow is the only possible type of story. "

Call your insurance and ask them to send a letter like this (and ask them to mail a copy to your address for your records)."

"Sure, I'll give you the argument from the other side.  

The argument from the other side is that the news media portrays his actions in the manner in which you described because it makes people oppose him without further evaluation.

&gt;Trump seems to hate immigrants even though his Grand parents were immigrants.

He opposes illegal immigration into the country.  People that do not follow our immigration process and have led to the development of an underclass of people without legal status.  The illegal immigration depresses wages for the poorest Americans by increasing the labor force.  Illegal immigration has also become the major funding source of Mexican cartels and leads to the [rape of 80% of the women crossing the border.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/central-america-migrants-rape_n_5806972.html)

&gt;He dismisses claims of black people that they are being targeted unfairly in the justice system.

He does, the meeting he had recently with Jim Brown and Kanye West was about justice reform.  He issues [pardons for black people.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44390737) due to request from people like Kanye West.  He has also issued [pardons for past historical wrongs relating to black Americans.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/sports/jack-johnson-pardon-trump.html)

The issue about him not listening is largely around his lack of support for Black Lives Matter.  

&gt;He opposes any idea that would benefit non-whites to get equal opportunities.

I'm not sure how to interpret this, but all Americans are supposed to be treated the same regardless of race.  So favoring one race, even a minority, runs counter to treating everyone equally."

"Because when you own the disc, you can always play the game in it's original state. On PS4, digitals are always the latest version. 

For example, I can put in the WatchDogs 2 disc, and see that super realistic vagina they made on the women, before patching it out. If you went digital, that vag is gone for good.

There are many reasons to own the pyshical version of a game, some like to have it in it's ""natural"" form, case with art and whatnot. 

That said, I get any MP games digital, so I have a copy for our 2 PS4s. Can't beat 30 bucks a game basically. 

But RDR2 is special to me. I'll want it in it's best form. It's worth more than asking, to me, anyway. I know I'll be playing 10 years from now, MGSV, Spider-Man, God of War, ect. so those I get the steelbooks. "

Also they should stay off social media if they don’t want to hear it. People are assholes and it happens in every sport so either get off social media or ignore it.

She looked like a young Halle berry, but a little more stylish. Her eyes were like a puppies, and her face was so clean and her lips so full. I chickened out, I could barely tell her how to get where she was going because I was so in shock by her beauty. I still think about her a lot."
"I think that university is about finding and pursuing your passions and what interests you. It's an opportunity to actually learn more about the world and yourself.

But now I see it has the potential to enrich your life and your mind greatly with courses like this, ones that are able to inspire you, challenge you, and eventually change your own world. Of course, there are lots of down sides to university, with the busy schedule, assessments and stress, but if we find something we are passionate about, it kind of makes it all worth it. The idea of changing the world is very ambitious, but it is inspirational how people are able to change the world. It takes a lot of commitment and effort, something which is difficult to do during the busiest time in university, but I would definitely like to explore it in my spare time and see what I can do to change the world. This course definitely challenged my thinking and helped me understand why I think the way I do. The passion the course staff have for this topic is inspiring. "

The midbass hump and forward mids presentation of the 6XX make it a really good starting point for people who are just getting into the hobby because they won't be complaining too much about the lack of bass and have enough detail being shoved into their ears that they'll start to pick up on things right away."

Spencer seems like he genuinely wants to remove non-whites from the US and seems to admire some (or many) things about Hitler, so while he may also be a troll in addition to being a neo-Nazi, he's probably legitimately a neo-Nazi. He tries to put on a relatively friendly face and hasn't called for violence, but if things were different and America had some 1930s style crisis and Spencer was somehow elected president and no longer had to restrain any of his true views, I wouldn't be remotely surprised if he started killing people, locking up political opponents, removing Jews, and generally turning the country into a totalitarian shithole."

"Every version of the ""why hasn't America gone into an all out riot"" comment has the same shortsightedness.

YES, we all can see that Republicans are doing absolutely everything they can to stop people from voting, and even changing as many votes as they can get away with.  They will undoubtedly steal some seats in the upcoming election.  But they're doing all this because voting still matters.  The blue wave can still drown all their corruption if it's big enough.  We have to give a democracy at least ONE fucking chance to fix this even though we know those in power are trying to subvert our Democracy.

"The A1 is absolutely fine as it is. Fantastic gun for long range and if you just want to relax and play slow.

The A2 is weird. It should be a decent gun but it really doesn't stand out in anything. The recoil is jumpy and unpredictable, the DPS leaves a lot to be desired (especially at medium range) and it's just outclassed by another AR at almost everything.

The A3 is underwhelming because it's essentially a less accurate A1. Maybe giving it a longer 4-hit range than the A1 (and somewhat significantly longer) would help its viability.

The Para is rubbish right now because the Vector has better damage, firerate and insignificant recoil. I have no idea what can be done to remedy this apart from nerfing the Vector into the ground, as they're similar in other stats. Swap the minimum damages on the Vector and Para and that would do some of the work.

The HBAR is directly outclassed in almost everything by the HAMR, and is worse than the L86 in everything apart from mag size and firerate (slightly). It needs either a handling buff or a firerate buff."

"I always start with industry away from residents, usually separated by a river if possible.  And have the only way between them be a freeway (well 2 normal roads at first till I unlock freeways).

I tend to building too many grids myself.  They can look great but I forget to add some curves until I build roads that follow the shore line.

For Res &amp; Com I’ll usually start with a large square of Large Road, knowing that I will ONLY zone Com connected to the large road.  Then I’ll usually have a medium road cut thru the big square some how, then off of that small roads for Res neighborhoods, that’ll back up to the commercial zones.

Biggest thing I “try” to plan ahead for is freeways and trains.  They both take up a lot of space and are super helpful if you can pull off a large loop with them.

Also try and keep industry &amp; trash near/right-off the freeway for easy access to rest of city."

"I have fought to answer the same question as well. Inside, their is an inner desire. As I have heard the phrasing best before  ""I want, to want, to quit.""

The unfortunate part is that it has always resulted in the latter. I suppose , as this is my first post on this for or reddit, that it is another ""start"". Yet, I still question and hold an uneasy understanding of weather I have the desire to quit or not. With that internal conflict I often find myself in knots with little to no understanding of where to go.

"Getting into FFA (Future Farmers of America) in high school. I had recently moved in with my mom late into my freshmen year of high school. It was like April when I transferred. I set up my sophomore schedual like my dad had me brainwashed into: computers and animation  or astrophysics (thanks big bang theroy. Dont give him ideas!). I lived with him in a tiny MI town and moved to a huge suburb of Houston TX. Figured itd be perfect to start on computers here. Then one scheduling mishap later I was in the ag class. I think what it was, I expressed interest in going to that class but wanted computers prioritized in case things were full. They read it or I filled it in reverse. So I go into an agriculture class, the teacher says stuff about FFA and I get into it. Fucking *into it* Within a year I abandoned computers and start focusing on agriculture.

"**Leucocoprinus birnbaumii**

Leucocoprinus birnbaumii is a species of gilled mushroom in the family Agaricaceae. It is common in the tropics and subtropics, but in temperate regions frequently occurs in greenhouses and flowerpots, hence its common names of flowerpot parasol and plantpot dapperling. The fruit body   is mildly poisonous, if consumed in large quantities.

I hate the Dodgers as much as anybody but I’ve always quietly admired Kershaw from afar.  I know his velocity is down 3-4 mph the last couple seasons but he has still been a damn good pitcher. Can anybody try to explain/toss some theories out as to why he has been absolute ass in the postseason for his entire career? I just don’t get it. Is it just that it’s a long season and the wear and tear on his arm makes his pitches move less/slower? Is it truly some sort of mental block? How come guys like Bum who pitch just as many if not more innings are so much better?

"&gt; So will these changes not negatively impact your quality of life that you worked so hard to attain by being a SFH owner?

I want to chime in here as another one of Seattle's *many* pro-density SFH owners.  I feel it would be selfish and short-sighted of me to work against changes that the city clearly needs in aggregate (more density everywhere, MUCH more density in neighborhoods like mine that are close to a commercially zoned ""urban villages"" and have good transit to the downtown core) just because they would have some negative impacts for me personally.

Density in my neighborhood *could* inconvenience me in petty ways.  Parking might be harder and/or not free.  A new building might block sunlight part of the day.  Traffic might add thirty more seconds of waiting to a left turn on my commute.  That kind of thing.  But when I bought my home, I didn't extract a promise from the other homeowners that nothing could ever change on my block for decades.  I believe the good that can be done region-wide with more density in Seattle (controlling rents, discouraging sprawl, etc.) vastly outweigh my cranky homeowner skin in the game.

TL/DR: most YIMBY homeowners I know are in it out of a sense of social responsibility, not trying to make a buck.

"Thank you for your help, and I apologize for the delay on my end, I just needed to step away from this for a while.

A minor update:
I got Resurrection Remix working by flashing firmware, and then Resurrection Remix.

Unfortunately the same process didn't work for LOS.  I'm not sure what RR is, but at this piont I'm contemplating adhereing to the old adage: if it ain't broke don't fix it. 

But I will try following the instructions you listed.  Can I rewrite them to see if they make sense for my situation?

1.) Bootloader unlocked (after 30 days)

2.) fastboot erase userdatat

3.) flash Redwolf Recovery (I'm guessing this is a replacement for TWRP? I'm assuming for my use case I can still use TWRP)

4.) Wipe everything

5.) flash no-verity-opt-encrypt (Can I use that exact specific file or is it a different version for the Note 5, seeing as the linked instructions are for the Mi Max 3?)

6.) flash xiaomi.eu (this is something that I'm worried about.  First I have the Global Version of the phone, won't flashing the eu version mess things up?  Secondly do you know a reliable place where I can get it?)

7.) Some ambiguity here: let phone start up and then boot back into TWRP and wipe reset, install LOS as normal?

Is that pretty much it?

So basically the only thing I have to do is flash no-verity and then xiaomi.eu and then proceed to LOS?

Also (I'm sure you've picked up on my impressive technical prowess by this point), if I'm not interested in rooting, is there any reason to flash Magisk?  

Thank you for all your help."

"Congratulations on booking your first trip! Travelling solo can be daunting the first time but taking that first step is always the hardest. I definitely learned a lot about myself and how to be more self sufficient the first time I solo travelled so I don't think you need to worry about that! I agree with what other people are saying here about hostels, definitely opt to do any activities they might have. The common room is also a great way to meet people too, and you'll be surprised to see how many other solo travellers are out there! Don't be afraid to put yourself out there! An easy ice breaker is just introducing yourself and asking where they are from :)

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy history and beer/whiskey too, so a few quick suggestions would be not to miss Edinburgh Castle. Seems like a no brainer I guess, but it is fantastic. If you are on a budget and looking for cheap beer and food, I'd suggest going to a Wetherspoon's pub. It is a chain in the UK so you won't be getting a ""true"" pub experience, but because they are a chain they can undercut other pubs in prices by quite a bit. I'd still recommend going to a true pub at least once though, some of them can be truly unique. Scotland is also the best place in the world for whiskey in my opinion (sorry any Irish folks or people from Kentucky in here) and there are distilleries everywhere. I don't know what your day is looking like when you travel the highlands, but if you end up east of Inverness there are two great distilleries called The Glenlivet (in Glenlivet itself) and Glenfiddich (in Dufftown) I'd recommend trying! They are both known for great Scotch with smooth finishes.

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy your trip! :D "

"This actually just happened moments ago:

Girlfriend texts me that she went to a ""psychic"" with her mom. Then she proceeded to tell me that I'm in ""trouble"" because this ""psychic"" told her that the man she will marry isn't anyone she knows yet. I text her back thinking she just went for fun and didn't buy into that, eventually I realize she is dead serious and believes the psychic 100%. 

I broke up with her a couple hours later after realizing she wasn't joking. 

The way I see it, either a) shes a fucking moron or b) she heard what she wanted to hear and just didnt have the guts to say it to my face without the cover of the psychic. At best we could stay together until eventually she finds ""prince charming"" and either cheats on me or breaks up with me because ""he's the foretold one"".

"TLDR; go with what you desires the most and make the best out of it. And whatever decision you make, try to keep this gentleman as a life friend.

.

If you think this situation as an MMO game (say, Dota or WoW), would you go for short game advantage or long game advantage? Tho the answer seems to always be “duh, of cuz I wanna be the final winner”, you also have to look at your surrounding: do you have the capability to live up to a long game strategy and ‘win it’?

Take another hypothetical scenario: if a random rich uncle shows up and decided to fund entire 8 years of medical school for you, giving that you well aware that you going to give up quite a bit of social lifestyle, real world work experience during that time... will you do it? And do you think you can live up to your own expectation?

It’s all give and take, really. The most important thing is to appreciate what you took.

If you are to find a better pay job, I hope you appreciate the increase of financial capability and do invest them one way or another. But chances are (even myself), money is likely to be spent on lifestyle and pleasures.

If you are financially stable to keep going with the current job for next N months/years and decide to follow this good manager of yours, you will be more likely to want to learn as much as  you can (since you are quite well aware that it will be all for nothing if you did not self improve during this time).

Whatever you choose to give (time, physical strength) and take (money, experience), make sure you are been real to yourself. Eventually you’ll constantly bettering yourself.

If you are to ask my objective opinion:

* go for long game advantage
* set few goals and periodically remind yourself
* learn as much you can from this manager, while been respectful (don’t act like a leech)
* don’t be surprised that you find better mentor in the future, this is bound to happen if you constantly look up higher
* try to make him your life friend, in a non cringing way. There’s a lot you can learn from a  quality human being, which can be quite rare in today’s materialistic age."

"Big Giant Warning (since this is a class project): you have absolutely no way of knowing *how* that pen was damaged. You can't, and shouldn't, automatically assume it was during the process of proper use. In fact, with a broken tip AND a vent hole crack, this pen might have been in the hands of a litttle kid, mashing it on the ground. Or is could have been in a desk drawer for years, without a cap, slamming around and getting smashed.

A pen *routinely* only has a crack at the vent hole when too much pressure (from trying to flex the nib) is applied. It rarely happens on one occurrence, but more likely a repeated (and mistaken) use. A broken tine is almost always damaged from dropping the pen, nib-point first, onto the floor.

Those are important caveats: you don't know that this damage was done in normal writing use."

So if this option is available, they would first need to disable animations from effecting the game timers, which already removes the problem at hand."

"I'll use an analogy with food. I was raised on a crap diet because my parents didn't care and also had a crap diet themselves. I've slowly been able to fix this with mindful sampling of new foods. [Here's a link to a quick explanation](http://www.mindfulnessdiet.com/program/articles/a-mindfulness-eating-exercise-simple-instructions), but I discovered this before I knew it was a thing. The idea is to thoughtful meditate on sense/psychological responses to food. For example, I hated vegetables, so I'd take some lettuce and let it sit in my mouth. There was bitterness accompanied by a negative psychological reaction. I would work on letting the negative reaction dissipate (kind of like exposure therapy for phobias perhaps), and then continue eating mindfully, learning to value the variety of sensations over time. Value systems - such as the appreciation of being able to eat plant life, the amazing complexity of plants, etc. - would contribute to an overall valuing of the food. Had to fighting gagging at times too (e.g. bananas and blueberries in oatmeal).

You should be able to see how a similar approach can work with sex - there's a lot of ""appreciative value building"" you can do here. "

"I'm going to clarify something. There's no such deal with Laurier that ""we cannot establish a business faculty"". This is a rumour and is not true at all. Think about it. Is that even legal? And over the years, do you think that UW wouldn't renegotiate such a clause? For those claiming that this deal exists, show us the proof. There's no such deal, and you all ""heard from someone"", which is false information. If this deal really exists, then don't you think that would have applied to Math/bus, Sci/bus, env/bus, arbus, mgmt engineering, or any programs that related to business, including the new Conrad School of Entrepreneurship &amp; Business? If that's also the case, why is UW even allowed to have business courses in AFM, Math, Arbus, Econ or even marketing? At the same time, why is Laurier allowed to have math/science courses? UW and WLU are ultimately separate universities, we are allowed to take courses at each other's (or double degrees), but we are separate overall. Such binding contracts do NOT exist and in a way is restricting a school's academic freedom and research ability. If they truly want to restrict competition with Laurier BBA, they'd disallow institutions like SAF, econ, Math/finance to even exist nor will you be allowed to take the courses. However, UW still markets itself as ""study Accounting/Finance/business @ UW"". If you ever go to Unifair, on the sides of our booth (4 corners each), we actually have ""business+"" representatives in case people want to study ""business"" at UW. If we ever have that kind of restrictions. This would likely be disallowed.   


 I worked closely with recruitment at SAF and UW overall. I've asked the very same question to the admissions. They told me that this is something that people have been pushing the school to do and they now and then bring it up at the school's meetings. UW has been advertising itself ""having business-oriented programs"" with a touch of ""innovation &amp; entrepreneurship"". When I told them that ""apparently we have a contract with Laurier that we cannot have a business faculty"", the recruiter laughed and said, ""that's ridiculous, where you hear that""? I also asked admissions that, if students ask us: ""why doesn't UW have a business school? does UW have a business school? what if I want to study general business""? We are instructed to answer something along the lines of ""we do have many business programs that combine other disciplines such as Arbus, which allows you to customize your degree and explore various options under the broad umbrella of business. If you want to do accounting, we have Biotech/CPA, AFM, Math/CPA. If you want to do finance, we have CFM, double degree...if you're interested in other areas of business, such as marketing, we have those courses available as well. UW offers it all, but the way we organize it is that we simply don't have a business school established, although you are free to study them here at UW"".  


I hope this clears up the confusion and misconception about the ""we have a thing with Laurier that they are not allowed to have an eng faculty, while we are not allowed business faculty"" nonsense. You might ask then, why is it that UW never had a business faculty? What's the real reason? This is my personal opinion: obviously, UW might think, ""there's already Laurier on the other side of the street"", a lot of business programs are very well-established in Ontario. How does UW's new faculty able to compete with Queens, Ivvy, Laurier, UT? My second guess is that UW doesn't think it's worth the investment. Sure, we have our SAF, and many other business-related programs. But to establish an actual faculty, we need a lot of money. Say Bloomberg lab, full-time profs in marketing, accounting, finance, investments, operations management, you probably need a new building, how about the recruitment costs? How do we ensure UW has students? Are we able to ensure that if we establish a marketing program, it will be successful? There are too many considerations here. Having a business faculty means a complete reorganization of the university, and its programs (likely all Arbus/enbus/scibus/biotechCPA/mathCPA...would be merged?) and does that mean we should establish an MBA program? You might have noticed that the way UW markets its business programs are not the traditional BBA kind of thing. There's a lot more focus on entrepreneurship and innovation, say the new Conrad School. SAF markets itself as Accounting + Finance with CPA/CFA focus. These are areas where UW would have an edge compared to other big business schools and WHY students want to go to UW rather than Ivvy for business. This is probably also why AHS/Environment faculties are organized since they are really one of a kind in Canada, along with our Pharmacy/Optometry schools. I wouldn't be surprised if ever UW establishes a Business Faculty, it'd be named something like, ""University of Waterloo Faculty of Business &amp; Entreprenurship/Innovation/Data Analytics"".  


In my personal opinion, UW seems to be moving towards eventually establishing such a business faculty. We don't know in what form and what types of programs it will offer. I think UW already has lots of resources/profs/courses that would allow you to explore various aspects of BBA. We have a solid econ faculty with wide ranges of econ courses, we have many finance courses offered by Math &amp; SAF, we have HRM/Marketing courses, as well as lots of entrepreneurship opportunities and a well-established start-up culture. We have many business clubs established in UW already. If UW ever want to establish a business faculty, we really have a something for it. The problem remains with money. Who is going to donate to UW to establish it? How are we going to house a faculty with likely 5000+ new people? If you ever go to SAF during class begin/end, it's like a high school in there. The HH building is already like at full-capacity. You'd literally have to push people to get through, we need a new building if we ever have more new business students. You know how UW is, when would we ever get a new building that isn't engineering? I think the business faculty would be established eventually for better organization and branding (people and students are all confused of UW with the XX/business thing), but I don't think it's any time soon.

We're not talking about **over**eating. We're not talking about doing good things for others. 

You said it was sinful to eat for pleasure. It isn't. There isn't a single dictionary that would support your definition of sinful. Eating for pleasure is not wicked, immoral or shameful. I just ate a biscuit for pleasure.

You may personally not want people to eat for pleasure, but that does not mean it is sinful, and I was pointing out that when a label is misapplied like that (and like the WT also do), then it should be called out.

Se me había olvidado el accident laboral.
"Unfortunately, the author‘s intention isn‘t always immediately clear upon reading something online. This is especially true when the author has cited only a half a quote that, when completed, reads, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country’. Ordinarily, the author makes an assertion and then cites a quote that backs their assertion. It‘s rather hard making sense of the author‘s intent when that author has presented only a half of a quote—particularly one prone to misinterpretation.  
Yes, in that quote, JFK is urging people to get involved in civics. But, you emphasising on, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you’ portion of the quote—and failing to clarify what position you‘re taking—can also mean you‘re suggesting that the government isn‘t responsible for public safety, that we should accept the status quo. This goes against the concept of a social contract.   
Your subsequent post established your position, but only in cementing that you negatively viewed the function of government. Often, when someone says the government is corrupt, they’re usually implicitly asserting that they do not trust the government carrying out any of its obligations. It was only your third post, in which you unequivocally established your position—one that did a 180°, might I add.  
I must admit that I believe you only changed your stance in your third post to save face. Still, I tried to give you a way to save face with my previous post. After all, you‘re right—we mustn‘t be too quick to make assumptions. However, your latest post is too much to ignore.    
I gave you the benefit of the doubt, but that didn‘t help. I was respectful to you as a person while addressing your argument head-on. In an argument, you‘re required to counter your opponent’s arguments, all the while ensuring that you do not attack them personally. Frankly, I‘m not sure how you’re trying to spin this on it being my fault for misinterpreting your half-baked ‘argument’, for the lack of a better word.

"I think this is the root of the problem though. With the way Long handles the situation he is going to cause *massive* problems with the power vacuum caused by his death. Even if he has the best intentions which makes his path the ""best"" it is still bound to be a disaster for the USA in the late 60's-70's. If we got a Soc Con path with someone like Lindberg or Patton taking over for an assassinated Long for instance, then you would have a much better AUS path that would be closer to some of the CSA options."

Abortions shouldn't be something that women are scared to talk about with fear of being judged. I had an abortion before as well and it fucking sucked, it was a shitty choice I had to make but it was the choice that was right for me. What sucked even more was never being able to talk about it, it's so politicised even when its not demonized. There were times when I wanted to talk about it, times when doubt or regret kicked in but noone to really say those things to. Sometimes I still wonder if I made the right decision but I am so happy I had the right to do so and I am so proud of the women that made that choice a possibility for me. 

I remember when I had mine I choice not to take the pain medicine that makes you groggy. I felt like if I was going to do it then I needed to feel it, like I needed to punish myself, no body deserves to feel that way and women like you talking about it and normalizing it working towards that.

People can’t be expected to stay a child/teenager and can’t be crucified for wanting different things. I just feel Cait is so afraid of having to find her own identity outside of Tyler, being a teen mom, Teen Mom the franchise and having to deal with not one, but now two babies that the idea of having to face her reality that Tyler may not be in love with her anymore is harrowing. 

Personally, I wish she would have waited  and actually went through couples counseling before they even considered another baby. I’m sure she’s sticking her head in the sand because she knows the truth herself. 

I wish Tyler would have held off and would be up front with Cait about whatever is going through his head. He needs to air that shit out or they’re both going to be miserable forever and drag their girls through it which is un-fucking-fair. "

"&gt;Whatever happened to ""hate speech is free speech""?

They aren't being internally inconsistent with their logic. That's the whole point. They're being reverse kafkatrapped into a kafkatrap only an anti-white racist could fall into.

To say that it's *not* okay to be white, which is what the university and the media outlets are doing, ***is literally hate speech***, while they simultaneously condemn a perfectly acceptable statement as racist. But you're all much too consumed in your self-righteous anger to notice that you're the only ones spouting hate speech.

That's when you get hit with another round of ""hate speech is free speech"". Which will also be swiftly and roundly decried by the media and academia. 

Which demonstrates the major flaws in the logical consistency of society's self appointed moral arbiters to the general public.

"I can give my two cents based off of my experience emailing potential supervisors before I started my MSc in psychology and what I've discussed with my supervisor so far.

I recommend that you briefly introduce yourself (where you're studying, what you're studying), mention your undergrad thesis, what programme(s) you're interested in (especially if they teach on those programmes), and broad goals. Remember, once you actually start the course you'll have time to drop by office hours and chat with them in person about all of this. Faculty get an insane amount of emails a day so it's better to be short and sweet.

As for your specific questions:

1/ I personally wouldn't mention the ADHD. It's just too much information at this point.

2/ As far as I know they don't have to but it's better if they are. For example, my undergrad supervisor was a developmental psychologist but my project was on social/health psychology and she couldn't really make good recommendations for literature and whatnot compared to other students who had developmental projects. So they don't have to be an *expert* in ADHD neurobiology but the more experience they have can only benefit you.

4/ I think that depends on the school? In my own school I don't have to be supervised by someone who teaches on my course. But again, the people who teach on my course are probably the people who have experience in the field and well, we went through that in 2.

6/ I think it's best to remember that your supervisors also have their own projects going on. I came into my programme with an idea that I wanted to work on but when I met my supervisor he was already working on a couple projects that I thought ""oh! I can build on this instead!"". Again, this goes back to whether or not they're in your area of interest, etc.

Hopefully I've been somewhat helpful!

"I agonized for ages on this for the first kid and now I am rerunning everything again now that I actually need the two seats. 

The Contours Options is essentially the same as the City Select with the following differences I noticed in the Options: bigger basket; much longer when you’re using a single seat; insanely less expensive especially with what it includes in the base price. But you have to buy a specific sub-model of Options (elite? Be sure to confirm that) to be able to buy the not-included bassinet (and don’t get mixed up and buy the bassinet for the Contours single stroller). That’s the part I “messed up” since I didn’t know the bassinet was a thing in that brand. 

I have major bassinet envy since I would let them sleep supervised in that (eg finish out a nap), but not in the car seat. 

I didn’t check out the Vista because it’s even more than the city select. But it’s the same idea. 

Someone said the city select folds smaller than the Options but that wasn’t a concern for me. The options also can’t roll while folded, in case that matters. 

I skipped over the Sit and Stand because I had concerns about wheel size — there’s snow where I am. But I get envy for it sometimes too. "

"It's not a complex at all. It's 100% based on history. There is no objective reality where the Giants losing a very good player is more important than the team obtaining that exact same player. Whatever impact losing him has on the Giants in no way over-shadows the impact of gaining him, and that is even more true when the receiving team is making a playoff move. It is not inherently more interesting that the Giants are blowing it up than it is the Lions or making a move for the division
If you think so then you simply buy into the national consensus, which is sad.

The real complex is the inferiority some Lions fans feel where they think the team actually deserves no coverage until they win in the playoffs. That's nonsense and inherently false. And of all places the NFL Network should have the least bias since they are serving exactly 32 markets. But they don't, and far too many Lions fans think that makes sense."

"Non-Catholic here.

The Catholic view is that all sanctification is by cooperating with grace. Catholic theology is NOT pelagian. You are not consecrating yourself and transforming your own self through works. 

Rather, the endless stream of Christ's mercy is known to be present in some things, which, when we participate, make us more like him.

These things are sacraments, rites, and other means of grace. 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, praying makes me holier. As does serving the poor. Not because I pulled up my bootstraps and God gave me bonus points, but rather, these things put me in the way of the river of Grace.

&amp;#x200B;

By doing what Jesus did, the Spirit is renewing our minds and making us more like Him.

None of this is pelagian. On the contrary, it's an excellent philosophy of spiritual formation and transformational practice.

"Well you'll find that there won't be a difference. Ryzen will automatically run 4 sticks of RAM in dual channel configuration. Furthermore, you run into stability issues with overclocking RAM with more sticks.

Dual and quad channel **DO NOT** mean how many sticks of RAM will your chip use. Your system will use 32 GB of RAM whether it is in 4x4 or 8x2 configuration - it doesn't matter. What DOES matter is how your processor can access your memory in parallel.

Quote for GamersNexus: ""A single stick of RAM will operate on a single 64-bit data channel, meaning it can push data down a single pipe that is 64-bits in total width. The channel effectively runs between the memory controller or chipset and the memory socket; in the case of modern architectures, the memory controller is often integrated with the CPU, rather than acting as standalone board component.

By utilizing multi-channel platforms -- something available on every modern build -- we multiply the effective channel width by the count of channels available. ""Effective"" is key. In the case of dual-channel configurations, we've now got 2x64-bit channels available to the memory. This means we've doubled the data traces running in the memory bus, and now have an effective 128-bit channel, which in turn doubles maximum theoretical bandwidth. This is why I made it a point to say that dual-channel platforms are what exist, not memory -- in the case of dual-channel, the board will host 128 physical traces to handle data communication between the IMC and RAM. This is compared against 64 for single-channel platforms and 256 for quad-channel platforms.""

SOURCE: Explanation of how Dual Channel RAM works - https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/1349-ram-how-dual-channel-works-vs-single-channel?showall=1

Reddit threads explaining why you should go with dual channel memory:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/8gr2b2/4_dimms_of_ram_with_a_ryzen_2700/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/6wn9qo/can_someone_explain_the_compatibility_of_quad/

https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/95w1ly/dual_or_quad_channel_ram_on_ryzen_2400g/

Quotes from the above reddit threads:

""Each channel supports up to 2 DIMMs. This means for dual-channel you can have 4 slots, for quad channel you can have eight slots, and for eight channel you can have 16 slots. Filling up all 4 slots on dual channel would give the same performance as filling two if you could run the RAM at the same speeds. However realistically filling up all 4 slots is likely to lower the maximum speed you can get.

8 GBx2 puts you at 16 GB right away and you can get a very fast kit if you want that. It also leaves you open to upgrading to 32 GB in the future with another 8x2. Which is useful because if you need &gt;16 GB of RAM it won't matter if it's a bit slower. The performance difference between RAM speeds is meager, but between not having enough and having more than you need is night and day.""

""1) 4 DIMMs are a little harder to get to run at rated speeds than 2 DIMMs (even though you might get lucky and it will work just fine).

2) Infinity Fabric speed is 1/2 of RAM clock, so the faster your RAM clocks, the quicker the IF speed (which speeds inter CCX communications). How much of an effect this has is application / use-case specific, so it's not a universal speed-up or slow-down.

That said, the faster you can run your RAM the better.""

Quad channel only works for chips such as Threadripper, which is **not** a consumer chip.

***So* my question to you is, why are you so keen on getting 4x4 RAM sticks?**"

This is a precautionary measure since the vast majority of posts from new account holders on reddit are either spam **OR** they are rule violations from new users who often haven't bothered to read the rules yet. Limitations for new account holders is a common policy for subreddits.    

**You may not appeal if any of the following conditions are true;** 

* your account is less than two weeks old

* the post contains a link

* the post contains an image 

* the post contains text or images from a blog.  

* You want an apeeal becaus you have another reddit account. The age rule is based on a per-account basis.           

**NOTE: If you are NOT submitting a link to your own site/article/video/works** your best option is to spend more time on reddit cpmmenting before you start posting. Only if your post / account does not conflict with the conditions listed above, you may appeal this removal by kindly messaging the moderators of this subreddit (see link in the 'Moderators' section of the sidebar). Please include a link to the removed post. Otherwise, spend some time learning and enjoying reddit, particpate in the comments, and then come back to post after your account is more than a couple of weeks old. DO NOT message for an appeal if your account / post has any of the conditions listed above because you will not be granted an appeal.

**If you ARE submitting a link to your own site/article/video/blog/works** 

* Read the subreddit rules which are posted on the subreddit rules wiki page, the sidebar, and the post submission page just above the submit button. ***Repeated failure to follow those rules will not only lead to a ban of your account(s) but your site(s) as well***. 

* **The only option for self-promotion** is to use our sticky feature called ""The Self-Promotion Safe Zone"" posted to the top of the subreddit.  You are encouraged to submit links in the comment section of that feature post about your works.  *This is the only place in the subreddit where self-promotion is regularly allowed.*  We encourage you to use it often and keep our readers up to date with the latest news on your site/works.

"I know you said above that the kids were sidegrades too but for me they were also upgrades (Except for Reiju). Not as much as Judge but they are better than original. 

Germa teams have plenty of damage. They lack utility. Compared in a vacuum I'd agree that the kids are sidegrades but when looking at difficulty content, now and upcoming, I'd have to say they are upgrades which was why they got their + versions in the first place. 

Reiju for me is possibly a sidegrade. I love the attack down debuff remover but I would love damage reduction and paralysis remover back. But then we did get a debuff and conditional boost in 1 special which is always awesome. 

Original Germa teams are going to have trouble with upcoming content so their clear rates will drop compared to Germa+ while Germa+ can clear old content just as good as original Germa. So for me personally, it's an upgrade."

He's been an active member of the community, active volunteer of OCF, a hard worker, and is a good man at heart. In the five years I've called him a friend he has loaned me money, given me money, helped me find a rental, helped me move, helped me find a new job, and the only thing he's ever threatened me with is a good time. Ha

He's got a broken heart and is turning to drugs. This is all super cry for help material. It looks really terrible on paper.

Reading the article on register guard it says he, in essence, showed up to his recent ex's work all drunk and on drugs begging for a hug. I don't blame his ex for calling, who I know to be a wonderful person as well. She must have called this in to check his cry for help. She cares about him but has moved on.  I know it says she's received violent voicemails. I'm not in a position to judge that but I feel like it was an exaggeration in the report. Not sure. Drugs do play a factor. He's been ""partying"" nonstop trying to cope. He's not a tweaker or a junkie (yet), he's doing a bunch of coke and Molly, drinking and driving. He's basically suicidal and needed this check.

I wish there were words of support and advice I could have given him before any of this got to this point. I had no idea they had broken up or why he was so torn up last time I saw him and he's not one to share it. Hmmph

I don't know what I don't know, but I do know he needs his friends help and maybe this wake-up call. I just hope they don't throw the whole book at him.

"Have you looked into Rover? Doing that a few times a week can help a ton, and some are very affordable - you can find people who will run with her, and/or take her to parks. 

Another option is finding a playmate for her. Meetup has some dog groups that might work - you can check those out and try to find a dog pal for your pup; getting together for play dates will be terrific activity. 

Beyond that, look into giving your dog jobs to do. Dogs love to work, think up things you can teach her to do (one awesome suggestion I saw was sorting dirty laundry, as well as picking things up). You mention toys and puzzles ... are you feeding your dog her food in a bowl? If so, switch to making her work for it. Things like scavenging around the house or making her work out how to get the food out of a box that’s taped shut are great for occupying them (there are plenty of articles on this with detailed instructions) 

Also, dog agility classes can be fantastic for wearing out super energetic pups. 

As for the size of your townhouse, I wouldn’t worry about that too much. Dogs sleep most of the time they’re alone, and huge homes and yards are no substitute for *interactive* activity (people who think that letting their dog out in a large yard is sufficient activity, or a replacement for walks, are WRONG). What matters is total activity. If you can get her on long walks and play with her most days, and add in occasional other activities like those above, she’ll likely be just fine. 

**However,** if you can’t manage that - or if you honestly don’t *want* to - then rehoming her may be the right choice. I hate suggesting this (it kills me to even think of giving up my dogs), but it if it’s truly in her best interest you should consider it. Your responsibility is to do the right thing for her, and if you don’t feel you’re up to caring for her, then finding her a good home that will care for her properly is the right thing to do. But you also have a responsibility to do it **soon**. The older she is, the less adoptable she is. If you go down this path, you must do it sooner rather than later (and please, please screen people carefully - reach out to local animal rescues or dog groups guidance on this; it is so hard for her to leave her family, you must make DAMN SURE that she’s going to a wonderful FOREVER home so that she doesn’t go through this again). 

Now I’m sad. But as long as you do what’s truly best for her (and NOT just what it easiest for you), you’re doing the right thing. "

"I'm a fan of the unsweetened vanilla tempt hemp milk product when making random shakes or doing something like soaked nuts / tigernuts.  It adds a significant amount of calcium, tastes decent for an alternative to milk, and is a cool source of GLA.  That said, supplemental calcium often looks sketchy for cardiovascular health and it's easy to quickly blow past safe RDA limits -- some of these nut milk products boast ""50% more calcium than milk"" which, imo, is often more of a flaw than a feature.  If you're getting more than 750mg-1g/d of Ca, I'd avoid supplemental Ca entirely, and if supplementing, I'd avoid going over 750mg-1g in total Ca intake.

For iron, I've heard good things about the bisglycinate form.  Again, it's one that often looks sketchy for cardiovascular health in anything more than doses used to avoid deficiencies.  You'll want to keep an eye on ferritin and only supplement if truly needed.  In general, I subscribe to the idea that running low-ish levels of iron is ideal, so long as you're not exhibiting symptoms of low iron.  Iron is a pretty good pro-oxidant, where running lower levels is actually a decent way to avoid some level of damage / aging."

"I think it’s more of a bullshit feeling for people. You get one shot and die instantly point blank and can’t even react to it. This is why shotguns have historically been pretty shitty except for a few like the KSG and Spaz12 for example. PC snipers are way better than console snipers. That’s just how it is. The disparity from console to pc isn’t really that different. I’ve played on both and snipe on both. Theres good games and there’s bad games on both. 

To address your point of “pc players that use guns are better too” statement, it’s not something that really matters as you can do well with the snipers even with that argument. 

The inconsistent nature of snipers has always been in COD games. That inconsistency is what makes it hard to play them, and that’s the only reason it’s even remotely difficult. Trust me, it has always been there on pc and console. If it was point shoot and one shot kill worked every time, sniping in this game would be broken as fuck. 

A good quickscoper can wreck on pc and same goes for console. I’ve witnessed it and I’ve also done it. This game just has extra challenges like ultimates, specialist equipment, and along side that, armor. You have to counter all those things as well as get kills. 

Trust me, if snipers sucked on pc, no one would use them. Yet everyone has been running paladin acog since the game released. 

If it were up to me, I would adopt the system overwatch uses for widowmaker. Make it do full damage after a second of scoping in but make not being aimed in do full damage as well so you can try to hit a no scope if you’re getting rushed at by an smg etc. and I would make all the other sights other than scopes do slightly less damage and have a lot of sway without letting you hold your breath.  This goes for all platforms. "

"&gt;give examples of men in power going crazy

Well, you've had 2500 years worth of leaders to go through at least.

Women have had power for 20-30 years and already have been exposed as being purely filled with hate. Whether that's because politics only attracts radfem lunatics or that all women are secretly like that is up for debate, but the facts remain that no female leader has shown even a little empathy for men.

Just to get a few examples going 

Angela Merkel - banned paternity tests in 2005 to protect women's ""right"" to paternity fraud.

Theresa May - You seem to already know how far this shithole has fell, but my personal highlight is the recommendation for the CPS head that rigged court cases against men to get a royal title.


Well that's fair enough, and at least you acknowledge this place is going down a hateful path. 

I want to believe you, but I just don't. Pure and simple. I've read and seen enough hate from feminists (even got a few hate mails myself from them on here - my personal favorite - ""you should be stabbed in the face"")

That was back in the 60s, when communist terrorism was common and actively sponsored by the Soviet Union. Times have changed. And we’re talking about liberals, anyway, not communists.

&gt; What about the shooting of Republican congressman? The attempted stabbing of a republican legislator in California? Mail of poison to Trump, his family, and members of his administration.

A handful of individual incidents that are vastly outstripped by the overwhelming number of right-wing attacks.

You’ll notice that I didn’t dispute that those were left-wing attacks or tried to claim that they were false flags. That’s because, unlike right-wingers, who are even at this very moment trying to dispute that this is a right wing attack and claim that it’s a false flag, I am not human garbage."

"I'm happy to share my process.  

I have a D500 and I shoot exclusively in RAW, so when I return from a shoot each picture is about 25 mb and I'll usually have 200-600 photos (I've got a cumulative 96 gb of capacity in my camera SD slots).  

I use a [single collection location](https://i.imgur.com/Y2jQFSV.png).  As mentioned, the entire thing sits inside google drive.  I use the year-month folder system and the drive is shared with all of my family.  Every user (even my 91 year old grandmother) can pull up drive-&gt;shared with me -&gt; lightroom and access my photos by year-by month.  

So, when I'm ready to bring in a new batch of 200-600 photos, I pause google drive because that will overwhelm the system.  Since I'm temporarily not backing up the new photos, I won't delete off my SD card slot until I've gotten to the point where they are properly synced with the cloud.

I do a first pass and shortcut key 'x' on anything blurry or just mediocre/bad.  If I have a small batch of things of the same composition, I'll do the x/y comparison and quickly pick the best one ('p' button) and then 'x' all the bad ones.  If it's a big batch, I'll circle back to that later when I'm feeling up for comparing them to find the best one.  This usually takes me from 200-600 down to like 40-50, similar to you.  At this point, having deleted the 80% that didn't make the cut, I'm okay to unpause drive and allow it to start syncing.

I have a lot of smart albums (this is a recent implementation after having spent years just doing stuff by rote memory) and each one is for a specific step or rule to get me from start to finish, with folders that are there for checksum() or validation stages (folder should have 0 contents, if there's something in that album, then I've done something wrong and am not following my protocols: [example](https://i.imgur.com/Hl2PNdM.png)).  Right now I end up with 4 designated file sizes based on the long edge: 2000px (good enough to ever print 5x7, looks fabulous on a phone, fine for most desktop backgrounds), 3000px (still for my lessor photos, but reserving extra space because anticipating future technology will make 3000 the new 2000 some day), 3840px (I have a 4k monitor and it is AMAZING), and 'original resolution', which is over 5500 if there was no cropping involved, and typically results in a final jpg that is about 15 mb.

I start flagging my 40-50 photos with the 6,7,8 keys to make them red (will eventually be 2000px on the long edge), yellow (3k), green (3840).  I don't necessarily reduce them in size right away, but there's a smart folder for things flagged with a certain color but long edge &gt; the designated threshold.  Smart folder is called something like ""Reduce to 2000?"" or whatever the respective threshold is.  This way, I can sleep on my thoughts and not get around to reducing the file size until I'm ready.

When I get around to reducing, I have presets for each of the designated outputs that export as jpg and reimport add to collection.  As soon as they are added, I delete the RAWs.  This will dramatically reduce the storage size (25 mb RAW -&gt; 1 mb red, 2-3 mb yellow, 4-7 mb green, and up to 15 or 20 for the 3840 or full size).

My current star distribution 7833 get 1 star, 2024 are 2 star, 493 are 3 star, 161 are 4 star, and just 38 are 5 star.  For reference, my 4 and 5 stars gravitate to more recent photos as my skills have improved over the years, but I still am averaging about 1-3 five star photos a year.  These are certainly kept at full resolution as they are worthy of printing on a huge canvas for a gallery exhibition (I'm not a professional, just a hobby).  Most 1-star end up red, 2 and 3 star tend to be yellow or green, and my 4 and 5 stars are 3840 or full size resolution.

I'm currently at [21.5 gb](https://i.imgur.com/xds5tRe.png) for the entire collection.

As for your specific questions about cutting down duplicates, the x|y layout is great.  Don't hesitate, go with your gut.  Sometimes I hesitate and wait a day if the composition is more 'artistic' in design, but if it is more straightforward people,places,things, your gut is right 95% of the time.

Annie Liebovitz was asked how she takes such good photos.  She said the secret is to not let people see the 98% of her photos that are bad.  I take that to heart.  I'm a big believer in the power of curating, editing (culling), and I advocate that you make a bigger impression showing just 1 photo that is a 9/10 than if you show that 9/10 and a similar but slightly different one that is an 8.5/10.  Unless that 8.5 is fundamentally different, artistically speaking, just get rid of it and keep the 9/10.

All my best.

A great Craigslist story. A guy was selling 240 lbs of used plates for $300 and including a free weight stand. I offered $144 which was .60 per pound. He said “the lowest I will go is $250 because I’m throwing in the weight stand.” Hmmmm. That’s less “throwing it in” and more “selling it for $100”

"As a huge fan of scotch and craft beer, this resonates with me. My friends who are into it tend to be like this.

In general, I don't really care what you like as long as you're not trying to criticize me for liking something that you think tastes like a burnt stick.

But I had a buddy over and he noticed my bottle of 18-year Bunnahabhain (got it from my sisters for Christmas -- normally I drink more reasonably priced stuff), so I offered him a glass; as I was pouring it, he asked me to add a ""heavy-handed splash of club soda."" 

I drank that one myself, and offered him the Chivas that I keep for my dad. I'm sure it came off a bit gatekeeper-y, but there's no way I'm pouring a mixed drink made with $120 scotch."

"I'm a dude, but my girlfriend is also an Engineering student, and to add to that she's a PhD student in a department where her incoming cohort was 2 females and ~30 males. I think being close with a woman in Engineering opens your eyes more to their perspective. She never claims to be the victim of some rabid sexism and she doesn't prance around claiming that life has been so hard for her, but the fact is that she faces issues that male Engineering students don't face on a daily basis.

These issues aren't things so big as someone going up to her and being like ""lol u r girl so u r stupid and not good engineer"", but smaller more subtle things that slowly build up and make you feel alienated from your male peers. For example, just trying to find friends and a reliable study group is hard when all of your classmates are male. Even if you do find a good reliable group of male friends, its always not going to be the same as having friends who are also female and can identify more closely with you. Or when you do get close to your male classmates, you don't want to risk getting too close because you don't want them to get the wrong idea or to get feelings for you. Then there's the whole thing about unconscious biases and feeling like your voice matters less in discussions. I mean in the majority of these circumstances, sexism isn't the right word to really use but its just the fact that these are small things that eventual start to weigh heavy on women in engineering.

Most of these issues aren't even anyone doing anything ""wrong"" per se, but they are still issues that women face. The only real way to fix many of these issues is to increase enrollment in certain fields of Engineering of course, which is why people try to advocate for women in STEM.

Males on this sub-reddit get really defensive whenever a woman in STEM talks about their issues as if the woman is telling them ""It's your fault these issues exist!"" That's not always the case, sometimes issues are just issues and its not really any one person's fault, but people just want to vent about their issues and garner some sympathy.

"AZ local. Been to this venue over a dozen times at this point and they've actually changed quite a few things since decadence last year. Water last year was stations, the last few fests (PHX lights, Goldrush + BooAZ this last weekend) they have a pour yourself kind of situation. Looks similar to a HUGE water container with a bunch of spouts around it. Self-serve. There were about 5 for boo and no line the four times I went up, but I do know decadence tends to bring a crowd. I'm assuming they'll add a few water containers, but even last year with the stations the lines aren't too bad. Got water in under 10 minutes each time. 

they have a bunch of hotels around the venue but only Wildhorse Pass is within walking distance. Then there's a strip of hotels 2-3 miles away. Transportation sucks uber-wise as nearly everyone will stay til the absolute end and surge up the butt. I'd highly recommend doing the taxi line, as they offered a standard rate for us last year which was kind of cool next the surge uber was having (if you're unlucky). But even two miles away it took us about 30 mins to get home. For the BooAZ show on Saturday they were checking people's shoes occasionally and they do check hair, which was kind of new.

Without invoking God or the bible (which I view on par with taking arguments from the Greek myths), tell me why homosexuality is wrong. Tell me who porn hurts when all parties involved are consenting adults (and if you say it hurts children watching it, how does it hurt them?).

Tell me why, if souls don't exist, should I care what a woman does with a mostly undifferentiated clump of cells post sex?

"That's racism. It's beyond clueless to claim that's not racism. Also, some stereotypes are racist, so they are not mutually exclusive either.

""You are XXX nationality/race, so you must be a terrorist"" is no different than ""you are xxx color, so you must be a criminal"" or ""you are xxx, you must be a Nazi"". These are typical cases of racism.

I know you looked up Wikipedia to decide racism is a ""belief in superiority of one race"" and you'll cite it in your next post. Before you do that I'll tell you as wikipedia says, it has multiple definitions. Prejudice and discrimination toward other races is also racism. They often go hand in hand. But even when they don't, race based prejudice and discrimination is racism.

&gt;  It also is a two way street, do you know the race of the person who you quoted?

It's not a two way street. Racism is racism regardless who is committing it. I know the race of the person. It's not relevant."

"I guess it depends on how you look at it. My way of thinking is, sports like soccer, tennis, baseball, how you play the game is dictated by the style you want to play. Some people play extremely offensive in soccer, others focus on defense, etc. And you can be the best team/player in the world if you are extremely good at that style. In league, while if you are extremely good at your own play style, you may get far, you will NOT be the best team in the world if your style isn't suited for how the meta is. The team which figures out the best way to play the game, and where the meta suits their play style the most, is much more likely to succeed. Whether that's playing through top at times, constant fighting, lane changes etc. That's why all 4 teams at this tournament at the moment have extremely strong solo laners. Of course, there's exceptions, but this is a pretty general conversation."

This mind set is not predatory, or evil; it is offering a service, for a nominal (well, they'd say it's nominal) fee.

I agree that active management is not the way to go.  I also concur that every ELP I've encountered personally, or heard about, will offer high load fees.  I imagine it's part of the deal of becoming an ELP (or SmartVestor Pro as they're known these days).  "

The so what about it is the outcome that could’ve happened. He could’ve extinguished a life that can never be brought back. That would make murder quite the profitable business if for instance I offered to kill a high value individual for a very very large sum of money and then just served my twenty fiver years or so then got out because I’m “rehabilitated.” It’s not very threatening in the grand scheme of things if the punishment isn’t as extremely drastic as the crime.

I'd say calf raises, of course. Running conditions the legs a little bit too. I'm not sure about other recommendations because it's not clear if every move that involves bending your legs hurts, or juat squats. 

How much does it hurt? Is the kind of pain that just a little bit of asprin of ibuprofen could ease (in which case I'd be inclined to still exercise, but that's bad advice), or is it worse?

I deleted YouTube because he kept watching things when I wasn’t around (with my husband/MIL). On YouTube kids you can limit the videos to safe-for-kids videos approved by YouTube themselves. I always hide the iPad so my toddler never finds it, in the kitchen, in my room closet etc. 

iPad have parental controls, restrictions for apps used, installing/deleting apps, purchases, etc. so you can look into that. 

For the tv, hide the control and unplug it, you can hide the cord where he can’t reach it. 

Don’t keep devices around where he can reach them when you’re around. You can use the internet router from the settings to block devices from having internet access. Have toys for him to play with and tell him he can watch a little bit of tv if he acts good, helps clean a little or something. "

YOTS cover gets this across very well. It's strange (how many mainstreamers may describe Death Grips), it's wacky and experimental (another feature of DG's music) and it's ugly and abstract. All of these attributes perfectly describe YOTS.

"Thanks for this, really good advice! Good point about looking behind when coming out of bike lanes-this was a quick lesson I learned yesterday. There may be bikers/skaters/other folks on wheels coming up behind you that want to keep going, and you're messing up their rhythm if you just stop right in front of them.

I'd also add-don't hesitate (if possible, of course)! Don't get in a bike lane if you're not sure you're ready to take off when the light goes green, don't start a turn in traffic and then bail on it, etc. Thus far, drivers have been much nicer to me when I move smoothly and predictably.."

"Well, one of the striking differences between Catholicism and Protestantism is what they believe about authority or the ""rule of faith."" Most protestants believe in something called *sola scriptura* or ""scripture alone."" Which basically means they believe that God's written revelation to man is the ultimate authority, where Catholics believe in the authority of the Church. So protestants see their ministers as ""superior"" only in the fact that they've devoted themselves in a special way. And of course, because they have more training, they are looked to for guidance and counseling. But scripturally, they are sinful people, and in need of God's grace as the next person. I believe this is also why some denominations elect their ministers instead of having them placed by the (larger, encompassing) ""Church"""
"There isnt such a thing as a true IQ test. It's all inexact science. There's actually some truth the tests online though.

Formal and informal, they're not accurate because you have a fluctuation in iq throughout the day of about 15-25% in either direction from your true iq.

"No problem I have answers for all your questions:
1. Personality wise you really only have the option between timid or modest (+sp attack or +speed). Most people will say +speed and they very well may be right, but I went +sp attack and tried to compensate by loading up speed with strike cards and equipment. 
For abilities, mimyku has the same choice on first abilities between + sp attack or + speed. I still opt for +sp attack. In my mind, because your crit damage ratio is higher than normal, increasing base damage is huge. So I run dragon whisper. 
For second ability I think your choices are between moxie and berserk, I think berserk makes so much more sense with mimykus kit. (Beserk triggers 40% damage increase when below half health- if mimyku is killed it respawns with 20% health setting you up for this). 
For ESOs you want to opt into damage, crit, speed, and healing.  
I take a lot of standard esos: increase health, increase sp attack, increase speed, guardian shield, increase crit(not the most common, but again crit is life on mimy). The big thing that's different is I don't increase def or sp def. In my mind it's a fairly wasted stat because most of the times your passive is going to save you anyways. Instead I pick up absorb which heals you based on damage. This paired with having mimyku on the wish platform and giving it heal-when-crit star means every attack mimyku does will full heal it. If I unlock four more esos through ancient relic for mimyku I would add def, sp def, synthesis, and probably dark resist or floral healing and probably purify(maybe I should be running this already) 

2. Matchups: these team can be fly and psychic teams but it's not as face-roll as hoopa and dnd. Here's how you beat them, 
Fly team- you have type advantage with mimyku into rayquaza. Just focus him, hopefully he gets confused and should be easy to finish off. If they have ho oh focus him last. And if they have tornados focus him second. Use arceus and use his ghost attack, not perish song- you don't want to do damage to hooh and increase his damage if you can avoid it. Also the accuracy drop is nice for keeping mimyku alive. 
Psychic team is pretty laughable. Ghost is good into psychic so quite literally the only three reasons I lose to psychic teams are as follows.
A) leles weather buff randomly lets them attack way too many times in a row. (Worst I've seen is 9 attacks in a row by same Pokémon) 
B) they have hoopa or sun or moon- it really becomes a bad matchup when any one of them come out and realistically they are easy to get rn through lucky snatch so *insert upside down smile emoji * 
C) they simply have way more power than me and are too fast. 
Arceus is still better than sableye simply because his crit increase on mimyku gets her going a lot faster, and the blind/accuracy decrease seems to work better on arceus than sableye. 
3. No j mimyku is not better than marshadow in battle settings, but I have beaten them before. The issue is a good marshadow will steal your crit buffs off mimyku and you have to be pretty lucky to win at that point. Again, the accuracy debuff on arceus gives you a chance if it makes marshadow miss. 
However, mimyku destroys marshadow 2X sac in WB and MR. Which is how you get shards to get other monsters and progress. That's why I consider j minyku to be the chance based version of marshadow. It clearly has lower stats but I think a-it's ratios are higher and b-it's deceptively better defensively due to its fake appearance abilities. However if both players are controlling their Pokémon, a mimyku shouldn't beat a marshadow unless you get lucky with confusion. "

Abstract

Emotional signals, like threatening sounds, automatically ready the perceiver to prepare an appropriate defense behavior. Conjecturing that this would manifest itself in extending the safety zone around the body we used the rubber hand illusion (RHI) to test this prediction. The RHI is a perceptual illusion in which body ownership is manipulated by synchronously stroking a rubber hand and real hand occluded from view. Many factors, both internal and external, have been shown to influence the strength of the illusion, yet the effect of emotion perception on body ownership remains unexplored. We predicted that listening to affective vocalizations would influence how strongly participants experience the RHI. In the first experiment four groups were tested that listened either to affective sounds (angry or happy vocalizations), non-vocal sounds or no sound while undergoing synchronous or asynchronous stroking of the real and rubber hand. In a second experiment three groups were tested comparing angry or neutral vocalizations and no sound condition. There was a significantly larger drift towards the rubber hand in the emotion versus the no emotion conditions. We interpret these results in the framework that the spatial increase in the RHI indicates that under threat the body has the capacity to extend its safety zone.

"The easiest way to get gold on the Screwball combat challenge is to take advantage of Photobombs while maintaining a high combo. Spiderbot and Spiderbro don’t actually add to your combo counter even though they do damage counter.


 What I didn’t realize at first is that you can actually photobomb multiple enemies and get bonuses, not just one enemy per light. Having the chain finisher skill helps a lot with this. Like Rogueshadow_32 said, you want to save your finishers for when the photobomb light shows up. Trip Mine and Impact Web are the best gadgets for Screwball challenges since they can take your enemies out fast and rack up multiple Photobomb bonuses.


Equalizer is probably the best suit ability for this challenge. If you gather all your enemies in one are and ko them one after another you can easily get 3-4 bonuses, boosting your score 6-9000 points. If you don’t have Equalizer, Quad Damage, Battle Focus, and Resupply work well too.


Other cheesy strats for easy kills are launching enemies, webbing them up, and yanking them down to web them to the ground. Suspension matrix + Trip Mine or Web Bomb for group kos. I’d avoid Concussion Blast for both challenges since it blows enemis out of the Photobomb area."

"See, here it is again, People putting words itno my mouth. Your just as bad as Rasferatu. I dont want them gone. I never once said I want antags to be removed. No one else has either aside from Ras. What I, and many other posters, have mentioned in the reddit is we want changes. As it stands, antags are not fun for anyhone, antag or raider. No matter what, when an antag shows up and actively participates, they lower everyones rewards. No one gets good loot when antags show up.

What most people want is either balance, proper matchmaking, or options. Thats it. I dont want them gone, I just want them optional, as a personal preference, but any of the mentioned available changes are a good fix. And honestly, if you arent a fan of repition and grinding, this game is NOT for you, no matter how you fool yourself into thinking it is. There are only so many missions, so many characters, and so many objectives. The fact that you have to do a mission roughly 90 times to get a new characters, or 45 to get a new gun(all max end stuff) means this game is all about the grind. Antags do nothing more than slow down everyones grind as it stands.

And if you want the proper matchmaking for making it optional? Easy. Queue up into antag mode, and you might get stuck as a raider, or antag, but EVERY match in antag mode has an antag. Queue in Raider mode? NO match has anatags. Queue as a team in antag? One of your teammates might even end up as antag against you. Simple."

"You would actually be very surprised to find out what is often included in top end contracts like those between AMG &amp; Blackberry.

You could quite easily get something like ""Lewis Hamilton must provide at least 500 hot laps for Blackberry"" added into the deal as ultimately the only major cost will be tyres &amp; fuel, which won't be that expensive for a company like AMG as they would more than likely already be transporting/using showcars on that weekend anyway.

However, in the case of these hotlaps it looks like this is a Liberty Media funded deal, where teams get to run their own cars (Alonso in the McLaren), (Hamilton in the Mercedes) to provide hotlaps for free to celebrities to try and get some good PR and advertising, introducing fans of WWE &amp; The Stranger Things (among other shows) to racing.

"I see it as both. 

There's the obvious psychological aspect where being positive and visualizing the fulfillment of goals inspires us to take action or to act in ways that we may not have if we were negative, thus increasing the odds of success.

But I also believe in some spiritual part of it too, some phenomena not yet completely explained by science. I've had experiences where things just seemed too good to be true and they worked out in perfect synchronicity without me needing to take any extra action outside of what was normal to me. That, plus intuitive experiences that just felt like it was so much more. Sure, it could have been coincidence or just me tricking myself into seeing something that wasn't there, maybe it was coincidental good luck that lined up with the time period I was practicing the technique. But still - it worked for me and I do think there;s more to this stuff than we know. 

Also, Law of Attraction is basically New Thought which is kind of different from how we talk about regular religion. Though it seems we're depending on some kind of deity to give us something, a hallmark of the New Thought teaching is that we are the deity we worship, we all make up the one God, what we call God is just a permission slip to activate the inherent power we already have. So it's not so much relying on God or completely abandoning the idea of a God that provides, but accepting that we have an active role to change our life by changing our state of consciousness. And by doing that we are utilizing and expressing what makes us both spirit and human. "

"Since your post mentions third-party docks, this notice has been added to remind users that many people are reporting issues with third-party docks providing improper power to their Nintendo Switch. This can cause a failure to charge so that the battery drains itself to 0 with no way to restore it, or just flat out bricking their systems. If you are considering purchasing one of these docks, please reconsider and go with a first party official Nintendo dock instead. Yes, they cost more, and some would say they cost too much, but the risk of damaging your hardware and losing your saves should make it a relatively easy decision. If you are concerned about the size of your dock, you can find third-party shells and transplant the innards of an official dock into a more portable container.

I can imagine some tools to pre-pop a bubble, like enacting a rise in capital gains taxes that would make people start selling now rather than later.  But I suspect that it is too late - once prices start going down, people will start to bail, and this will drive prices down further.  Now we're like Wile E. Coyote realizing there's no more cliff beneath his feet.

Giant stock market swings can be driven my modest changes in demand for stocks.  During the great crash of 2008, I believe that most people just stayed put in the market, so it took only a few bailers to cause a collapse.

&gt; Are people blind to the coming collapse

I think they are, just like they stay put in a hurricane.   Or maybe people think that they will get out on time, and everyone else will take the fall.  The best historical might be the tech bubble of 1998-2000  (remember the [pets.com sock puppet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sICSyC9u5iI)?).  Prices went up, up, up until all the Wile E.

No, because the alleged rape didn't happen - it was just a lie. The pregnancy, if it happened, wasn't perpetrated with the intent of framing Roy Moore, it would have been a lie invented after the fact.

Simply framing someone is not enough, you have to actually *do the thing* you're accusing them of for it to be a false flag. 

False flags are actions that are committed by one party with the express intent of framing another for the action.

False flag refers to the action, not the accusation.

"There's a couple of ways to deal with this.

You have to set a goal, it doesn't need a special meaning, just something you want to do. Plan trips, even weekend ones to give yourself something to look forward to. Build something. Whatever it is, it's best for it to be something complicated enough to work towards. If it can be solved through one trip to town, branch out more.

The second is to change your your life in larger ways. Move somewhere new, find a new job, do whatever it takes to pull yourself out of the same old thing.

And maybe see a therapist if you've lost all emotions. Being numb to everything is a sign of depression, which you may or may not be experiencing."

However, if it does not clearly state the rules of use and if you bought the laptop in full, that you can take it home, it’s a breach of privacy in your own home.

Basically you can say, “At school we might not have the right to privacy of our laptop, but in the privacy of our home we do and have a right to know if we are being spied on. The teachers authority is limited to the school and they have no right to view what we do in the privacy of our own home , regardless if the laptop is school owned.” I guess

"&gt;St Patrick’s Day actually started out as cultural appropriation — the entire purpose was to take Ireland’s feast day (aka holy day) and turn it into an attempt to mock them by re-enacting their most common stereotypes (especially the always being drunk thing). 

No it wasn't, stupid.  It was a way for Irish immigrants to North America to unify in celebration of their Irish heritage in the face of their fraying cultural identity, the overt racism they experienced in America, and exile from their homes by the British.  The fact that alcoholism is rampant in the Irish lower class is a symptom of that alienation and intentional suppression of their culture, not a ""negative stereotype""

&gt;Today, it’s negative connotations linger but the intent has been largely forgotten. Yet while Irish Americans (and may Irish in Ireland) will accept the stereotypes with a good hearted laugh, it doesn’t mean that good came out of it either.

"&gt; Cotton bags are not environmentally friendly... But synthetics are, which take less than forty trips to even out, and are way, way more common.

It's one example of many though, and no one seem to be suggesting we ban cotton bags - even though those are frequently sold as ""environmentally friendly"" alternatives to plastic bags (you can even see people in this thread bragging about using [canvas bags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVh15aUt8-c) instead of plastic one). 

The important point is that plastic bags sold in the EU are not a big environmental issue, and what's touted as environmentally friendly alternatives are frequently actually worse than plastic - which is something that your average upper middle class eco-aware consumers gladly jump on simply because their gut feeling that ""*plastic is unnatural = bad for the environment*"" while ""*paper, cloth, etc is natural = good*"".

&gt; EU and US do a great job of recycling when they actually recycle, but export a very large amount of those materials to Asian countries to dump in a river, which is part of the reason those cointries are so high.

Then the solution is obviously to scale up our recycling in the EU - Trying to ""clean up"" the garbage we export to places we know doesn't properly recycle it can't be considered a serious solution... Even if we get rid of all the plastic in the garbage we export to Asia and Africa, if that garbage keep end up not properly recycled it's inevitable that it will turn out that there's some other crap in it that will just cause some other massive harm to the environment.

The real problem is not plastics, but the garbage not being properly recycled - and if we don't fix that underlying issue, we will just get repeat after repeat of ""*This shit that's in our garbage is getting out in the nature and causing harm!!!*"". "

"The shortage of teachers has to do with huge demand, and mismatched salary. The state has a larger number of children per family than the national average = more demand per tax payer, but also a high % of stay at home moms which = even less taxes paid. Additionally the state keeps increasing child tax writeoff so even less being paid per family. When you consider over 50% of the total money to teachers comes directly from income tax you can see how there is literally no money to pay the amount of teachers needed. 

The solution is actually reduce the child tax deductions, but that will never happen because there are too many people happy forcing others to pay for their children's education. "

"Theres some great advice in here. I'm in a similar position (giggity) to yourself. I'm vers, historically been with more tops, so I'd bottom. My boyfriend now is mostly a bottom. The most important part is communication. I like to keep in mind, as a vers man, ""what would I want if I were him right now?"" That's my whole take on sex. Anything I do, I enjoy done as well.  So, I ask him. I introduce new things slowly (especially when we were first getting together). Then, I'd ask him what he thought. Did he enjoy it. What was his favorite, or least favorite part? I've learned things that I've done, that he doesn't enjoy. I've also tried new things, that drives him crazy (in a good way.)  

Dont be afraid to communicate, even in the middle of having sex. Or use phrases that show weather you love something or not so much. (We use different ways to say oooooo. Can be oooo that feels great. Or OOO as in we need more lube because damn that hurt.)

As a vers man, you enjoy sex. It's awesome. All aspects of it. As a bottom, he decided that he prefered one particular position or aspect of sex. He enjoys it. He chooses to have sex with you, in that position.  That idea might be somewhat foreign to a vers man (who tends to just enjoy sex as a whole experience vs a particular portion of it, in my experience.) But as long as you're being open with the communication, and not trying to go to pound town without lube, I bet you're doing fine. "

"The only way I can think of would cause you the trouble of hooking the old Mobo back up and retrieving it. If NCIX built it for you it would depend on what licensed version they bought. So like an OEM licensed version of Windows, like you'd get from a pre-built computer from say Dell, the key is tied to that ""computer"" I.E it's tied to that mobo and you can't just willy nilly buy a new mobo and expect windows to work. Retail versions can be different, a full retail license would essentially allow you to transfer your license. Not trying to waste your time either, to me, the answer can be tricky. I had an issue with they key when I got a new hard drive and not a new mobo. However I used the upgrade from 7 to 8 and so on. So when I reinstalled it on the new hard drive instead of cloning it windows was like FU something isn't right and I had to call MS and sort it out to get it activated"

"I tend to focus on the essence of the endowment, what it means for me in my life today.  I also consider what it means for those that passed not receiving it. The first time was for me, the rest it is for others. 

As far as changes go, so long as the essence remains the same I don't have an issue. Also, if Joseph was inspired by Masonic ritual, to create something similar for Latter-day Saints, I'm fine with what came as a result of that.  The endowment to me is almost too perfect symbolically to just be some random event.  The meaning within it and the centreing/focussing/orientation power it has inspires me to keep going.  Joseph being inspired by Masonic ritual and then revealing something is a prophetic pattern.  Things like the Word of Wisdom came after a question or prompting, perhaps the endowment came in a similar manner.   

I'm not a purist in the sense that everything Joseph restored or instituted has to remain.  Joseph set the framework and got the wheels in motion and prophets today have the responsibility for the direction of the church in our time."

"One girl who rejected me after she found out: 

""I'm a PERFORMER, not a TEACHER. I can't believe I WASTED my time even looking in your direction! Forget that I ever existed and NEVER talk to me again under ANY circumstances! Don't even fucking say hello to me if you see me somewhere. We're not friends, we're not acquaintances, we're not even enemies. When I'm finished talking to you, I will treat you like you were never born. You are nobody to me, and if you know what's best for you, you better act like I'm nobody to you. DON'T wish me well--I don't care what happens to you after this, I don't care if you're happy or sad or if you live or die. You have 2 minutes to block my number from your phone and to remove me from all your contacts lists. If you even walk on the same side of the street as I do, I will consider it harassment and I will go to the cops and you will wish you killed yourself tonight.""

Maybe they talk about it because people ask them about it? If all is One Mind, and someone asks you a question, then it is *you* asking yourself the question. So they answer *themselves* out of compassion.

I can't think of any other reason why one would bother telling others anything meaningful if one also thinks ""@#$% people."""

"**Gigabyte Aorus Ultra.**

Lots of features and connectivity (3 m.2 slots, speedy wifi, lots of USB, dual BIOS, post code display, little extras like thermistor cables etc.) plus it has good VRMs and good VRM heatsinks. Basically it's the same as Aorus Pro Wifi just with a few extra features and better VRM cooling (same VRMs though). 

So far so good. Auto settings boost everything to 4.7ghz with reasonable voltages and temps with no power limiting (unlike Linus' review). The CPU is a beast at these ""stock"" settings and the D15 handles it fine.

5GHz overclock was dead simple. Just changed multiplier, voltage, and LLC. 

Temps wise, my D15 can handle the 5GHz OC, but it's noisy under full load since the fans have to spin at max rpm. Tops out around 82C in a 15 min realbench stress test. Tops out around 89C in AVX stress test (no AVX offset). My ambient temp is around 19C. Considerably less heat is generated running it at ""stock"" (4.7 all cores) so you can subtract about 10-15C from both numbers, and tbh it's not any real world performance boost to do the OC anyway. It's really just for benchmarking, so I have a couple bios profiles where I can easily switch.

Speaking of bios, it's not as bad as it used to be for gigabyte. Asus still has better UX, but all the settings are here (sometimes you just need to dig). Smart Fan seemed just as good as Fan Xpert. I could link my case fans to GPU temperature, etc. I haven't installed any of the windows software, just did all that stuff in bios.

Overall I'm pleased with it. The hardware quality itself is great. The board is heavy and well built. Where I got it, it was about $50 less than Maximus Hero and I don't feel like I'm missing anything. These Gigabyte boards are among the first [recommended by SL](https://siliconlottery.com/pages/intel-coffee-lake-r) too, so you're not missing anything in terms of overclocks over the Maximus line. 

---

P.S. For the OP, don't get a ROG Strix Z390-H. if you are set on the strix, get a -F or -E, not the -H. The -H uses lower quality VRMs from their ""TUF"" line so it's not really suited for a 9900k. "

Everyone goes threw a slump. Nothing will be handed to you. You have to be willing to change something or try harder. Start setting alarms. Go to the library and study harder for classes. And go out of your way and try to make plans with people on your own. The worst that can happen is they no. But you never know until you try. And as far as your game go you’re probably focusing to hard and are too stressed to play at your top level. So zone out and play. You’ll probably do good

1. People attribute literally all of the positive stuff (but probably not the negative stuff ) to God, they believe because it brings them comfort that the universe is not a random terrifying place full of people who can't moderate their most base impulses

God got you a new job/apt/lover/won football game etc

God definitely did not crash your car or kill your grandmother

2.. And if there was a god why do you think you would have heard about the stuff (he) does? Miracles and crazy unexplained stuff happens all the time , ain't nobody writing that shit down and passing it around to everyone, this time


3.. How do you define evidence? What are you looking for? A fucking angel to come down and slap you in the face?

What about this: you live on the only planet in the universe that can sustain your species which requires a narrow temperature range, you are on a space rock hurling through endless space that no one knows why or how it got there, and you can do lots of neat stuff here like communicate with me, a person you have never met from an undetermined location, you can literally create or destroy whatever you want (but actions have consequences) and you can transcend your biological limitations in a million ways


4.. So how you can you say there's no evidence of God? And what do you think God is? A puppet master controlling your destiny from the sky? What if God was something else? What if God was not an all knowing all seeing benevolent dictator. What if there were more than one kind of God. What if humans were able to access hidden wisdom through altered States of consciousness, would that be ...god?

You're saying the comedic value of the channel has gone bankrupt, but there are at least a thousand things in the last 50 bad episodes that were much funnier than anything Ross has ever said.  I'm amazed every time I watch an episode with him, just how deeply unfunny he is.  I end up in a worse mood every time, and yet it's in my nature to put it behind me, so every time he starts talking, I listen without thinking of my prior experiences.  I give everyone a new chance every time, but if I'm listening to Game Grumps, I hold everyone up to the standard that you have to be likable and at least somewhat funny.

"I've just been to Liverpool and about 20 major European cities and I can safely say that in terms of architecture Liverpool would be in my bottom 5, probably only ahead of Ljubljana, Zagreb and Belgrade. Museums I can't really comment on as I didn't go to any in Liverpool, but there are some amazing ones on the continent (including in Napoli) so it's got competition there. Can't comment on nightlife either, but that's one thing I can accept may be better than in Naples and most other European cities.

"I won't be opening this thread, as /r/Conservative is not meant for general questions. /r/AskConservatives maybe a more appropriate place for you to ask your question.

&amp;#x200B;

You have no ""right"" to a word. I have plenty of gay friends in California who got ""married"" long before the judicial activism of the courts. What you are looking for is that people recognize your union as marriage, which is never going to happen for most people. Why? Marriage has a defined meaning going back to the Ancient Babylon (based on written records) that specifies a union between a man and a woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

This would be like me claiming I have a right to be your sibling. I may call myself your sibling, and we might act like siblings. But the word has a specific meaning that we do not actually meet. The country and law is not obligated to tailor itself to your delusion of being siblings. That doesn't mean we are banned from acting as if we were.

&amp;#x200B;

I 100% supported Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships, though I didn't think they were actually required under the 14th amendment (as states are allowed to discriminate on a whole host of issues). Redefining marriage served no purpose and ultimately created yet another wedge in this country. It was a fabricated issue, and you were used by the leftist intellectuals for a cause you aren't even aware of (I will not even go into it here).

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; I also believe in social programs to give people a hand up as I grew up on welfare. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conservatives also support hand ups, not hand outs. We also believe that the bulk of this should be handled by the States or the communities. I think you fundamentally misunderstand what the left supports in terms of entitlements."

"All of the gpt sites like instagc, swagbucks, grindabuck, grab points, etc. are going to have basically the same survey routers and offer walls.  You are not going to see much difference in earning opportunities between gpt sites. 

I have no clue what your offer walls look like in Canada but that’s what I do on gpt sites. I mainly do the free sign ups and the email submit offers. Most of those path offers are actually just email submits and if they are going to work they will after the first page. 

When doing any of those offers you want to make sure your allowing pop ups, allowing third party cookies, turn off any extra ad blockers you may have, and clear cookies between every try. Also use google chrome or fire Fox for doing offers.  There’s a great extension for chrome called vanilla cookies. It lets you whitelist sites and you can clear all cookies in one second without getting logged out or even losing your place on your offer wall. "
"I think respect is long gone.  If they admit culpability in the cover up I think that would go a long way to restore faith in the system as it would show America, and even our allies that it’s not the American justice system that is corrupt, it’s just the people running it.

Sadly I don’t see this happening in this case.  I feel like it’s too far gone for them to start back pedaling now.  Too many of the top players have become entangled in this web and to reveal the truth would destroy more than just the original players at this point.

I think -3 to 2H weapons, double EV and an ENC hit it worth +4 or even +6 to Resist Magic, especially since not all spells are resisted by it."

In the USA, what the left is fighting for is voting without any ID at all. You don't need one in NY or NJ for example.   What the right is fighting for is requiring an ID so you don't just go through the recent obituaries and say you are that person and vote for them.   Even where there are reports of the latter happening, the % are neglidgible.   It makes sense to have a voter ID law in my opinion but it also makes sense to have voting places EVERYWHERE yet I see lines of people waiting for hours - especially in low income areas....  I get that voting places cost money to staff and to have the equipment for, and that money has to come from the locals and if an area doesn't have high incomes, then they have lower tax revenues - but something better can be done I'm sure...  it's not a good system on either side."

"I have taken to saying, “Goodnight hologram moon!”, before going to bed. That’s if there isn’t cloud seeding, marine cloud brightening, mass electronic surveillance and/or harassment, or the moving of military equipment going on every other night by the gray ghosts in the sky. I’m agnostic about some of those claims of mine, but not all of them.
  
If I were to write a conspiracy novel about the Puget Sound, and Washington in general, based on my what I have seen around here, it might really manifest itself as reality. Too bad I’m a terrible writer. There’s a ton of weirdness to get down with. High strangeness, Technocrats, Oligarchs, increasingly bad homeless problems (not the people themselves), rise of mental illness and it’s strange closeness with eugenics, drug “epidemics” and the drug rehab industry and mental health, clandestine and “simulated” direct action exercises by special forces, domestic war games on 68 of our beaches that can last up to 72 hours, Naval electronic warfare exercises. 
Frankly I believe our special forces should know how to defend our country and be familiar with the environments they’re ordered to protect. I know that means that the opposite of defense could happen, but that’s the trade off for anyone who hires security. It’s the construction and our land they’re protecting from foreign and domestic enemies. Today’s friendliest neighbors can be tomorrow’s belligerents. People can turn viscous in the blink of an eye.

"""Portable"" is the industry term used for them, though this one looks pretty stationary.  Typically, you see portable plants in regions that experience cold weather for an extended time of the year (9+ months) as asphalt can only be laid above a certain temperature.  The colder it is, the less time you have to get it from the back of the dump truck and on to the ground.  (Source: Worked in Asphalt Process Engineering for 3 years)

Usually, aggregate bins (in blue, lower left corner) are built on top of a pseudo trailer, like you would see a semi-tractor pulling.  The dryer/drum &amp; burner would have their own trailer.  The (4) vertical towers appear to be for storage of the liquid asphalt cement, notice how the small concrete wall built around them is acting as a containment area for spillage.  In a portable plant, these would more than likely be horizontal tanks on a trailer-like frame.  What's interesting is the twin silos in the front right.  It could be for dust collection as it appears to be a belt conveyor transporting it to the the top but, I'm not sure.  I've not seen a setup like this before.  I assume the tall silo in the rear is for the finished product, but I can't see a drag slat or bucket elevator bringing the material to the top of it, so unless this plant is still under-construction, I'm not sure what's going on here.  It's a cool picture though, where was it taken?  I don't recognize the name on top of the tower."
"I'm trying to help people understand that 76 is not a MMO and truly is a ""Fallout with friends"" type of game.

Here are the difference I could tell from previous Fallout games.

No dialogue options
No slo-mo V.A.T.S 
And other people. 

The ""Fallout feel"" is still there though. 

I left the vault alone and was greeted by another vault dweller just as curious of the multiplayer aspect as I was, so we teamed up. On the way to the missions we looted, killed and talked about the things we could tell we're different right off the bat. 

1) Combat is fluid.
 I read an article on Forbes saying since vats was gutted you have to rely on a clunky FPS. I can say that was not the case for me. I was able to aim down my pipe pistol iron sights and shoot exactly what I was aiming for.
Also, we eventually Teamed up with another vault dweller that strictly used a Fire Axe as his weapon of choice and I was happy to see that melee was a formidable choice of combat Style.

2) V.A.T.S ..... 
We all loved V.A.T.S. It was a time to pause, think, and shoot. It was a easy way out, and when you watched that bullet fly all the way and pop a raiders head off, it felt good. However, this is a change in the Fallout mechanics that we were warned about, so why try and use it the same way that we have been?. I used V.A.T.S as a ""run and gun"" system and it worked surprisingly well. I would aim down sights on a scorched down the way, kill him, turn and unload a lead based hell down on any scorched next to me. Think of it like extremely effective hip fire. 
It's different, but tell me, which Fallout game kept every mechanics in the previous one? Let's adapt people.

3) other people. 
The vault, the first main town and very few here and there. That's my experience. The first few mission where it teaches you crafting and cooking were slightly weird because if someone is at the workbench you need than you needed to wait. But besides the few missions it was not a big deal as it would be in a MMO. There are ""events"" that people can participate in together, but think of it like a small event in destiny rather than a large event in ESO.

4) PvP
If you don't want to fight, You don't have too. It's really that simple. If someone starts shooting you it's literally a waste of ammo on their part. You take virtually no damage. Mostly everyone I encountered where friendly and just wanted to trade and be on their way. However, if you did want to fight, shoot back and it's a fairly fun fight.(I don't think players expected my V.A.T.S run and gun move though hehe)

5) The world of Fallout!!!
Why do you play fallout games? Do you play so you can pick the ""sarcastic"" option on the dialogue wheel, or do you play for lore, wasteland looting and genuine WTF moments? If it's the latter then you will not be disappointed in this game. The no dialogue was strange at first, but when I wondered the Wasteland I found Holo tapes of survival stories... Notes to love ones.. and a scene of skeletons holding each other in the bed of a pickup truck. I was in that Fallout universe that I know and love as soon as I started looting, and that's one of the main reasons I am hyped about this game.

6) survival aspects.
Just eat and drink something. Its that easy. There is a ton of Wildlife ripe for the hunting and early on you find water. Just learn and get in the habit of feeding yourself. Eventually if you level up endurance you will gain perk cards that slow the hunger/thirst meters and it becomes super less of a problem. 

7) CAMPS. 
I couldn't end the B.E.T.A without trying to build and I was not disappointed. While exploring you find logs you can harvest for wood and that can be used to build walls and floors. And your ""junk"" can build workbenchs and other types of fun stuff. The building has a convenient snapping feature that makes building fast and easy. once you're done building you can save it as a blueprint and then quickly build it later once you build your camp in a new area. I didn't build much in Fallout 4, but I will be in this game.

I really didn't mean for this post to be a full-featured review of the game...I'm just trying to be helpful for people that have read all the overwhelmingly false claims. If you want to try it, pre-order and play the beta. If you don't like it, cancel your order. I am happy to say that I will be keeping mine "

"There's also the free CW app which has all recent episodes of their shows. DCU knows that their fans don't necessarily need another place to see those shows.

Those shows just wouldn't be worth the added expenses to have in their catalogue as well. The old seasons will probably show up eventually though. "

"Weed is tricky in that it doesn't have any immediately obvious health risks like heart attacks or cancer *. The danger in weed is its amotivational aspects (I really like this south park speech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_pSXV8S-Gw). It's very easy to think smoking is harmless and to slip into the everyday habit of it. Then you'll suddenly realize you haven't exercised or studied in months and your diet is 90% fast food and snacks.

The legal thing is definitely important too.

Unless you want it to be possible for support classes to be able to do their thing regardless of their gear, you'd have to make buffs and debuffs scale with spell power/attack power/something, even a new ""support power"" stat. You'd also probably want to make buffs shorter and more dramatic. For Paladins, make their blessings into many mini power infusions."

"&gt; Absence rates are variables that falls between 0 and 1. Most of the times, they don't follow a normal distribution and some of the requirements that an OLS regression theoretically needs.

Two points here:

1) regression does not require normally distributed variables. The *residuals* require normality, which should be checked after building a regression model. 

2) if the outcome variable is between 0 and 1, OLS is theoretically not the right tool for the job. If you want to stick with regression, then logistic regression is a good choice. There are lots of other models to choose from as well.

"Their issues extended beyond not having a CV.  Ships other than no CV mattered, and possibly more important than that was the positioning.  You simply cannot give decent teams a free crossfire.  Your ships will be nuked in short order.

Bringing two DDs without DF/high AA DPS meant they had two very vulnerable liabilities on the map that required constant babysitting.

The decision to death ball IMO was a greater error than not bringing a CV.  Separating the force into smaller groups with very high AA concentrations that would at least make the CV pay for spotting would be better.

By splitting you are not giving the opposing force a free position to crossfire you.  It would at least force the CV to split his planes to spot, requiring more micro to minimize plane losses.

If forced to bring a comp without a CV in KOTS I would probably resort to double AA Grozovoy with only heavy AA CA/CLs with lots of radar.  Split into two groups and play for cap control since you the enemy will likely disengage any low HP ships.

If you cant spot, at least bring a comp that makes it painful to spot my team and has the radar to make it hurt to cap.

Your still very likely to lose due to a lack of vision.  Maybe if you could trade a CV for a third BB to have an HP advantage to really slam into a flank it could work better, but I dont believe its in the rules.

Maybe add a rule if you dont have a CV you could add a BB instead, a CA just will never have the weight to offset what a CV brings, but in certain instances a BB just might."

"I also had a Kinect 2.0 and decided to use it for full-body. I followed the guides, bought a solder kit, bought Driver4VR, and yes it actually works.  I even went all-in and bought some cheap LED light balls for the better tracking with Driver4VR and it marginally improved tracking and my play space size.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, if you're interested in full body tracking, I highly recommend just buying the Vive trackers. The Kinect 2.0 is far from great. It was very cool to use at first, but calibrating constantly and having my CPU bogged down was a pain. Not only that, all movements of your legs will experience about half a second of latency compared to your VR controllers. Let me tell you, the latency is noticeable and mildly irritating. On top of that, your legs/feet have *no rotation* with the Kinect 2.0. When your feet don't rotate at all and are constantly locked forward, they almost feel like dummy legs. Then of course the obvious downside is that you *must* face your Kinect sensor head on at all times while standing in the sweet spot about 5 to 7 feet in-front of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, yes you technically get full-body tracking with the Kinect, but you have no leg rotation, you must face forward at all times, and your legs movements are delayed by half a second and also restricted by Kinect 2.0's questionable skeleton tracking.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I first used Kinect 2.0 for my legs, I've purchased Vive trackers and it truly is night and day. The Vive trackers have no setup or calibration, no CPU cost, and of course the tracking is flawless with perfect rotational tracking and no delay. If you have no possible way of getting Vive trackers, the Kinect 2.0 is a fun project to get working and will enable limited full-body presence at a cost. I hope my experience has helped you! :D"

(Although being named Motoko Kusanagi, living in Japan, and being depicted as culturally an average person in Japan are some context clues).

Japanese people in Japan are not interested in representation as much as asians in America are. They see people that look like them all the time in their media. But to cite them and argue that asians in america shouldn't be upset is like saying white people in Canada don't worry about healthcare so white people in the USA shouldn't either."

Again, I want to make clear I’m not standing in either side. Just clearing up facts. If those jobs were not going to illegal immigrants, they would be forced to pay a higher wage to Americans. All of that said, there is not a shortage of jobs in this country right now. Anyone blaming their unemployment on immigration, with few exceptions, is full of shit. "
"You might need to say exactly which ESP8266 board you're using, there are several common breakout board designs.

I'd find it pretty unusual for a board to accept &gt;3V on a pin labelled 3V and if anything I would expect that to be connected to the voltage regulator *output*. If you've forced 5V onto the 3.3V rail then you may have fried the board (the ESP8266 can deal with a maximum input of 3.6V), can you check if it's still alive? The 1.6V likely appears because a protection diode is kicking in either inside the ESP8266 or the voltage regulator. Tough to say without knowing the board.

Active components don't behave the same way as resistors, and thus you can't treat them as such. Resistance is linear, the more voltage you supply across a component the more current will flow proportionally. Active components like transistors, diodes, LEDs, etc (remember your microcontroller is made up of diodes and transistors internally) may consume minimal current until reaching a threshold voltage when they suddenly consume power. These components can also be very sensitive to over voltage conditions so double check datasheets before connecting anything.

Finally if you're mixing 3.3V and 5V logic (which I assume you're doing with the LCD) you may find you need logic level translators to get everything talking properly. YMMV on this though, I know some LCDs will happily work with 3.3V logic on a 5V supply as long as you're never reading from the LCD (as this would put 5V on your microcontrollers input pin)."

"I've done two viz-based internships, using one or the other to accomplish very similar tasks... Tableau looks sleeker, and is more intuitive when using base functionality (shallow learning curve), but it bogs down if you're using larger datasets, lots of calculations, joins, etc. I've found Tableau works best if you can do most of your data manipulation outside the software (in your database), and try to limit your working information to one or a few smallish datasets.

Power BI looks clunky, and some of the background functionalities are a mystery without some significant background research/training. But I never had issues with crashes or lagging, no matter the size of my dataset (in fact there a rumors that BI will eventually be rolled into a larger data warehousing program - store and visualize data within a single software system).

Customer service wise, Tableau was more responsive to day-to-day questions, but Power BI seems to be more active in rolling out updates, including new visualization options every couple months.

Basically, if you're knowledgeable in one you'll be able to get up to speed in the other pretty quickly. Beyond that, each has quirks and advantages, but they're two flavors of the same ice cream."

"This thread is important. I can’t speak for the legitimacy of your claims specifically about Autism Speaks, but there’s a bigger picture here.

Pokemon Go is a worldwide phenomenon and influential platform for a multitude of age groups and segments of society across the globe. They should have a moral and ethical responsibility to ensure they push a positive agenda (and ensuring this is researched well!).

Based on the comments in this thread the decision to support this specific charity is questionable as best and most likely ‘laziness’ on their part. This is an unforgivable drop of the ball for a company like Niantic, with the many many millions of dollars at their disposal.

I really want to see Niantic break boundaries and create a game that is not only massively fun and profitable, but is also a ground breaking champion of environmental, ethical and social issues.

I’m still waiting on that eco friendly avatar clothing item that I can buy for 2,500 coins from the shop and has all proceeds donated to cancer research or investment in renewable energy. Yes a Gengar backpack looks awesome and is frickin’ cool, but what I REALLY want to show off to all my friends and family are that I care about these wider issues in the world and maybe they should too.

I really hope this thread gets enough momentum for Niantic to revaluate the amount of positive impact their able to make in this area, because unfortunately at moment they’ve not even reached the tip of the iceberg."

"I think it’s more than likely that the community has plateaued, but it probably won’t be going away anytime soon. 

The mostly likely outcome (as I see it) is that it continues to influence produces in more mainstream genres of music. Perhaps popular music will take a turn away from the hyper-produced, super-clean trends of the now and turn a little bit softer, more melancholy, and have the product have fewer layers of samples. This would be analogous to the transition in rock music trends from hair bands to grunge that happened ~30 years ago. If such a transition happened today, I think we’d all be better off. 

The biggest problem I think the community faces is saturation. Given the relative ease of making these kinds of beats (compared to other production styles) many people are capable of doing it in their bedroom. Additionally, the music is simplistic by design, which means that there is not as much wiggle room for artistic expression. It’s hard to stand out when you can’t make big moves and there’s so many others doing basically the same thing. I like lo-fi, but if you played me a song there’s a 0% chance I could even make a reasonable guess who made it, let alone tell you confidently. This is not true of any other genre of music I’m aware of. "

"&gt;No. The Christian Marriage the way we know is Christian. 

I'm talking about civil marriage.

&gt; The problem is that Christian Marriage was the law for a really long time here in the West.  

Never in America, Christian marriage was never ever defined in law, constitutionally it's not possible.

&gt;  But when the State divorced from the Church, the State stole the Christian marriage from Christians and continued to rule about marriage. 

If you are talking about America, you are wrong. America was created separate from religion explicitly. And marriage was never federally defined, it was always defined by states (and still is) but states are barred from making religious laws, so they still aren't about christian marriage, they are about civil marriage.

&gt; Nah. I'm winning. I don't live in America and neither in Europe. I'm not fighting against gay civil union, divorce or poligamy. I even vote for politicians that are pro those issues. I just don't want the state to hijack a Christian sacrament and tell everyone that it (the State) invented it. 

I don't know what country you do live in, but pretty much every majority Christian country is becoming pro-gay marriage. So you kind of are losing. Additionally, no one is saying the state invented marriage, the only thing people are saying is that Christians don't own (and I guess I'll say it: didn't invent) marriage. It has been around as long as society has it. You don't own it. That's the beginning, middle and end of the whole argument. Your church can define it however you like, don't tell the rest of the population they have to abide by it."

"I'd argue the opposite for Charlotte really. Does the prospect of another 12 or so title reigns really excite people with Charlotte?

Charlotte has done almost everything now. She's won titles on both brands. She's tied Trish in title reigns and will likely exceed it sooner or later. She has a PPV win record. She ended Asuka's 3 year undefeated streak. If she beats Ronda, that's basically it for Charlotte, she'd have done almost everything.

If anything, based on what she's accomplished and how little she has left to do now, she should be just putting over everyone nowadays."

"&gt;The problem with that article is that they never really define the term “artist”.


The original report that's linked to in the article does, and it says

&gt;Overall, New York City’s creative sector—which by our definition includes ten industries: advertising, film and television, broadcasting, publishing, architecture, design, music, visual arts, performing arts and independent artists—employed 295,755 people in 2013, seven percent of all jobs in the city. Employment in the sector is up from 260,770 in 2003, a 13 percent jump. Meanwhile, the city is now home to 14,145 creative businesses and nonprofits, up from 11,955 a decade ago (18 percent increase).

I agree that including some sectors like advertising is stretching it, but that's just according to you and me; just because someone's not an independent artist doesn't mean they're not ""artists"". And even if we don't like the advertising industry, they do employ artists or people with creative talent, and people who are junior in the industry aren't paid well."

"Some cars, yeah there's some easy and relatively cheap gains to be had if you know how to go about it.  Most cars in the 90's were meant to be seen, not heard, and manufacturers put a lot of effort into making the intakes and exhausts quiet.  Cheap manufacturers went the cheap way...US eco cars and most japanese cars did this through intake and exhaust manufacturing that was restrictive.  You could take a turbo Supra from the late 80's and chop up the exhaust and intake and pull off about 30hp at the wheels for under $500.  BMW and Mercedes, though, there's nothing to be gained by cutting up the intake and exhaust because it was made quiet by sound tuning instead of restriction...more expensive, but you got the performance and the silence.  It varies.

$200 for 25hp, though, is a stretch by any means unless the idea was a 50-shot dry NOS setup.  Then sure, but won't last long.  Realistically, and still talking about your typical 80's~90's cars, you can expect to spend $1000 for a reliable 2~5% boost that'll last the life of your car.

Today's cars, though...not much point in trying.  technology has kind of peaked to a point where we're already getting the most out of them without forced induction...and even with forced induction the only thing we can really do is tune for more boost.  The days of getting a few horsepower out of an exhaust or K&amp;N filter are gone...not because those things don't work, but because the manufacturers are already making the factory components pretty well.  I can still remember a shop in Houston getting their hands on the first Ford Focus SVT in the early 2000's and slapping on all the typical ricer go fast mods and after back to back dyno's they lost power over what ford's stock exhaust and intake was doing for the engine."

"&gt;You aren't showing your work.

What are you talking about? 

&gt;Every country has needed a labor movement or outside pressure in order to get these rights implemented. Even today manufactures constantly move operations to shittier and shittier countries in order to avoid having to compensate workers fairly- and then move on to the next shitty country as soon as a labor movement starts to take hold.

In every single case, productivity precedes any sort of labor movement. It's the economic development and accumulation of capital that makes these things possible, not labor movements. You can have increased compensation with capital accumulation and no labor movements, but the converse is not true. Take the United States for example - the single greatest period of growth for median wages was the post civil war period until about WWI, at a time when there existed almost no federal labor regulations.

"Cylindrical cells are \*worse\* at volumetric efficiency - the tesla cells are just designed to be further towards the energy dense end of the spectrum. It's the gaps in between the cells that allow for temperature homogeneity which in turns leads to a long life. Densely packed prismatic designs (leaf etc) are theoretically optimal in terms of packaging density, but often suffer from localized hot spots and significantly poorer lifespan than Tesla's efforts. 

Tesla's design is optimized for charge rates around where they are now. Further increases are possible, but only within limited ranges of SOC - the overall duration for a 10-80% charge won't decrease much further than today. The distance you can travel with that 80% will of course continue to increase with improvements in cell chemistry."

"1) There are dozens of solutions that can create AMIs. You can do it manually by booting up an existing box and call ""create-image"" to make your snapshot into an AMI.  I would recommend [Packer](http://packer.io/), but there is also [Animator](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/ami-creation-with-aminator-98d627ca37b0) and dozens of similar programs. The AWS API call is trivial, so it's really about the work-flow around that AWS API call.

2) You might also consider using Docker as an alternative. That way you can boot up a generic (tiny) AMI, then download your code + any OS it needs at runtime. You can deploy via DIY Kubernetes, EKS, Fargate or ECS."

"One thing that helped me was realising that there's absolutely nothing wrong with being distracted from your thinking. This one sounds obvious, but if there's an activity that focuses your brain elsewhere for a while, do it! Here are some that help for me:

- Video games (in moderation).

- Start that TV show you've been putting off for ages.

- Not turning down social activities even if they're tough.

- Finding comedians you like and watching their stand-up specials.

- Going for a walk (so good for just calming down).

- If it's reasonable, think about getting a pet!

- Learn a new recipe or bake something.

- Learn a programming language. 

- Join a local sports club for beginners squash or something.

- Start planning a holiday you'll save up for in a year or two.

You're probably thinking: yeah I know, doing things is pretty obvious advice but I'm willing to bet your OCD sometime says ""Hey you better not go do that happy or distracting thing cos then you're in denial and then you're not dealing with me."" which is just ridiculous, OCD is very mean.

Sort as much out with your lawyer as possible and let your wife stay where ever she wants.  Just try to get your affairs in order and take care and by god, eat.  Eat even if it has no taste and you don’t want to.  You’re gonna put your family in danger if you don’t stay healthy.

"Lilina has no double potential. Celica also has just as much attack as her when in Brazen range, where her 5 less attack is counteracted by the +5 from her weapon and the +7 from Brazen. Lilina only gets +6, so overall, Celica has a higher net attack. She also benefits from Brazen Atk/Spd and will get +7 from that, while a Death Blow 3 Lilina will get another point lower than that from the a slot. Celica can also run Heavy/Flashing Blade to get an almost guaranteed special proc every round. She can also use Brazen Atk/Res to get even more attack. Lilina has no reason to run Brazen Atk/Res because she doesn't benefit from any other hp restrictions and Ardent Sacrifice is kinda wasted instead of a Rally of movement skill. More attack for Celica. The only real argument Lilina has over Celica is an AOE set, but Lilina benefits most from no setup killing, and a first turn AOE will be hard to attain. Celica needs an ally to not have full health. Much easier. And we haven't even talked about Celica's unarguable better speed. Lilina's only positive is merges, and even then, Celica can still outperform her. I have both, I can attest. Sorry for making this kinda long."
"The others are just special cases of Observable.

`Single` is for when you know the stream will emit exactly one item, or error off. This is why it's so useful for Retrofit, because an HTTP request will only emit a single response, or an error.

`Completable` is for fire-and-forget type operations. It will never emit an item, it will either complete or error off.

`Maybe` is the Rx equivalent to Optional. If it has a value to emit, you'll get a single item on your stream. If not, the stream will just complete. Combined with the `switchIfEmpty` operator, I find it useful for getting stuff from local cache. If the Maybe emits a value, then my cache value is good. If it doesn't, then I switch to a stream that will fetch the item and cache it.

"I don't know if many people use the term ""aerial reset"" but what I'm referring so is when you hit an opponent in knockdown with a move that does under 7% and they end up in the air. This can be because of sdi or a move having high enough kb, but either way they become completely actionable. This leads to really weird effects though with strong moves like stale falco shine or stale raptor boost where they still receive a lot of knockback. So they go flying away while still actionable.

I found this clip of it https://clips.twitch.tv/TentativeFamousRhinocerosPartyTime. It happens all the time with falco, and if they jump after getting hit with it they straight up die from it."

No you haven’t, there wasn’t much of a trade at all in 70s. So you’re lying, it was a hobbyist thing for most of the 70s. 

You claim to be working in computers since the ""first PC” but [in this post you claim to be 52 thus you were 4 years old to 14 from 1970 to 1980.

You write like a late teens / young twentys neckbeard, all of your post are fighting people online about how macs are better. No one that claims to be that old with the experience you have spends so much time being a young angry kid on the internet.  At best your a help desk tech with some serious mental helath issues whose only encountered windows for the first time at your job. At worst you’re a teen whose parents have bought him nothing but macs and being a young kid your identity is tied into the brands you buy. So someone insulting macs is insulting you. 

Why didn’t you answer my question about your favorite first PC? 

&gt; it's because you're WRONG, and you know you can't prove your position.

nah I just realized its not worth my time to waste with a professional neckbeard / troll who literally has no break longer than ten hours from reddit, who makes dozens and dozens of posts and every single one of their post is fighting with people who you’ve deemed all dumber than you. 

For the love of god, go outside and seek treatment. Realize you’re not the end all be all. FYI someone with the experience your lying about btw wouldn’t have made the first fan boy comment that you did that started all this. 

Good luck in everything, and I really hope you get help. If you want to talk first PC computers, feel free to reply, let me know what your favorite first pc was. I’d love to actually talk about those.

"I agree that most international IT work is done in a monolingual environment. Product localization is the notable exception, and there's a big need for multilingual programmers there. Computational linguistics is another computer science field where it is really helpful to know foreign languages, although you probably wouldn't be using them very much on the job.

I guess I would disagree about business management. Most of the time foreign branches will be run in the local language, instead of an arbitrary language set by the multinational. If you go to Samsung Germany, they'll speak German in the offices there, and if you go to Samsung Korea, they'll speak Korean in the offices there. Engineers and scientists mostly speak with each other in English, but they'll often need to resort to a different language to communicate with management and field workers. Multilingual management that can cross-pollinate ideas between different branches of the same company are extremely valuable. And it's really nice to have multilingual management that can lead efforts to break into new markets that can't be reached with English alone."

"I met many a crazy person during my time in undergrad, but two stick out: 

1. I dated this woman during undergrad whose mother was a professor of pediatrics and law at a major university. Turns out she had a bit of an anger problem. I told her that I needed to study. This sent her into an absolute rage in which she snapped her pill case in half and ripped the lock out of her bedroom door with her bare hands. We broke up shortly after that. 
2. I had a friend that would come hang out periodically. She was “different,” but in a way that wouldn’t automatically scream “crazy.” Anyway, one evening my cat decides to hop into an Amazon box. Said friend goes over and starts yelling at my cat, claiming that the box is “hers” and that, and I quote, she “needs to respect \[her\] authority!” I kicked her out of my house and told her to never come back again.

Fox’s Judge Napolitano: If NYT China Report True, Trump May Have Done What He Criticized Hillary Clinton Over:

- After being asked what the implication of the Times’ report, Judge Napolitano said this on Fox Business: “The implication of this I am sorry to say is the same implication that the president used as a battering ram against Mrs.

- Is President Trump guilty of the same crimes for which he alleged Mrs.

- On Wednesday, Judge Andrew Napolitano weighed in the New York Times bombshell reporting that China has been listening in on President Donald Trump‘s phone calls by pointing out if the New York Times’ report is true, the President could be guilty of the same crime that he has pointed fingers at Hillary Clinton for committing.

- Clinton when he ran against her.

"I'm going to give the most honest advice you may ever get about the SAT Essay ever, and how I got a 20/24 on it. 

1. No one really cares about the essay. If you get above an 18, then you're fine. Colleges don't really use it anymore because they know the essay is a pile of garbage and just want to know you are ""literate"".
2. If you are struggling, use a template for the SAT Essay. You heard me right, a template. Don't waste time on test day thinking of a good hook for an introduction or a thesis format. Come into the test day prepared and having memorized your introduction and conclusion so you can quickly sub in words so that you can get to your analysis (which is arguably the most important part of the essay, and one everyone struggles with). If you want write your own introduction, all the better. If you want use a test prep book's intro and conclusion, thats fine too, no one really cares. Finally, sprinkle in fancy language in there, and you might want to consider talking about rhetoric(ethos, pathos, and logos) so your grader really knows you are all about it. I'll give a link to my essay so you can read it. I got a 20/24 with this essay and trust me, you can too! 

(Apologies in advance for my handwriting.I tried to write as neat as possible on this. It turned out better than usual but still not perfect especially near the end where I was rushing to finish)

I was fully confident those AMD Surface rumors were fake, but really, if they came to fruition, I might have bought a SP6.

&gt;Globalization has no winners, only losers

This is fine for a title.

&gt;The globalization is a word which seems to be present in each segment of everyday life and can be heard chanted ~~at~~ *on* every corner. An intuitive definition of this word would be ~~like~~ this: ~~g~~*G*lobalization is a process (hence the ending -tion) which embraces the whole globe, ~~henceforth~~ *as well as* its population ~~as well~~. Admittedly an addition of one word – “interaction” - would be favorable **(My question: favorable to what? The definition you've provided? At this point, you've defined 'globalization' as ""a process embracing the globe,"" not noting that it typically carries the added implication and definition of being an increase in interconnectedness in society. I fail to understand how ""interaction"" would add clarity, unless you mean it in lieu of the interconnection that comes with globalization, which I would argue is very much a part of the definition, rather than a side note.)**. It is the sole base of globalization, the driving force behind the scenes **(What is the base of globalization? Interaction? The process of embracing the globe?)**. It is not a recent process, some would argue it all started with the discovery of America, others would identify the beginning of the 20th century as the starting point, but for sure it has increased its pace in the last two decades. With the fall of Soviet Union previously communist countries opened their markets and their borders. China became a global player and a leader in production. A new fl~~&lt;~~ow of imports, exports, services**, *I would include this comma, but I always include this comma** and people has started. ~~A p~~*P*roof of ~~it~~ *this* is the huge diversity in which people live **(I'm trying to follow what you mean with this sentence. Are you trying to say, ""Proof of this is evident in the wide range of experiences that people can now have""? Or ""Proof of this is evident in the fact that we can buy and sell goods from all over the world in a matter of days &amp; weeks""?)**. Another big event was the ~~advancing~~ *advancement of* technology. ~~A person would~~ *Many people* now own a laptop, a PC and at least one smartphone. It is so in the developed countries, but *is* gradually becom~~es~~*ing* ~~a~~ *the* norm all over the world. The Internet access opens new possibilities for the media, for socializing, for the game industry and for shopping. But the unresolved question around globalization is whether it is a blessing or a ~~malady~~ *curse* **(I would use curse because that's a frequent phrase in English: ""Is this a blessing? or a curse?"")**.

&gt;It is hard to answer as most aspects of globalization are ~~polysided~~ *multifaceted*. For instance, English has established itself as the new lingua franca. For the English-speaking part of the world ~~it~~ *this* is a huge advantage, for the rest*,* extra hours of study. Other languages or dialects remain unattended and neglected, which may even lead to their extinctions. In addition, cultures tend *towards* merging *(alternatively: ""Additionally, marginal cultures tend to merge)*. Immigrants are becoming citizens and contribut~~e~~*ing* to *the* culture of ~~his~~ *their* new homeland*s*. Again, some would argue that ~~it~~ *this* is loss of local culture heritage, others would mention that this is the way it always has been, culture is a sum of new specificities **(I'm not sure what you mean by this. ""Culture is the sum of individuals / specific interactions / the sum of our collective actions"" perhaps, but ""specificities"" doesn't make a lot of sense)**, which made it to stand ~~off~~ *out* among other cultures. Another example would be online shopping. On one hand, it offers a variety of new products to buy and to sell, with an ~~attracting~~ *attractive* price for the buyer. On the other hand, it pushes local shops ~~to forced closes~~ *out of business* and as a result**,** more local business is forced to ~~give up~~ *close up shop*. Family business*es* that ~~is~~ *are* not able to adapt to the new adjustments imposed by globalization, e.g. a shoe maker or a farm**,** need~~s~~ to readjust or give up part of their history. The list of advantages and disadvantages could go on ~~like~~ and it would be a very large, but still finite, list. **(You seem to basically be saying, the list can go on and on and on, but it's a finite list, which stand in a bit of a stark juxtaposition to each other. A better way of saying this might be this: ""The list of advantages and disadvantages are both quite extensive, and for all the benefits, you can imagine a list of faults"" or something of the like.)**

&gt;There are definite winners and losers under globalization, but ~~such a division would be so for all processes~~ *this has always been found in social constructs* throughout ~~the~~ *human* history~~ of humankind~~. Therefore, I find the proposed title for this essay ~~awry~~ **""awry"" doesn't really fit here. I would go with something like, ""presumptuous"" or ""potentially misleading"" or ""is pushing a worldview to which there is much disagreement"" or ""a definitive statement for which there is no definitive proof""**

All in all, your word choice is good, your spelling is pretty good, many of the things I would change are things like ""it"" to ""this"" (where it just sounds more natural), a few stock phrases and word choice, or requests for additional clarity."

"Jazz is difficult, there is so much to know. I just pick up what I hear and what I have learned and apply those things. I almost always write modally. If I am inspired to be creative I will see what kind of state of mind I am in. Then I will pick a mode and a key. I will usually map out a 2 1/2 octave range on keyboard and build chords from those specific notes. Then I build the song in layers, usually over the drum and keys tracks. I like MIDI cause it gives me a lot of cool instruments. But I will admit a lot of my material is dark and not in the mainstream. It's just fun to create these little monstrosities."

"This is the market at work.  Think of it this way.  

You are selling your car and are Asking $10,000 for it.  I as a prospective buyer offer, or Bid, $9,500 for it.  In the end we agree on $9,750 which can be called the Fill price in options lingo.  

When an option Seller wants to sell an option they will Ask a certain amount, the option Buyer will offer, or Bid, a lower amount.  When the seller and buyer agree on a price the option trades and the order is “filled”.

To my knowledge the Bid and Ask prices have nothing to do with being Bearish or Bullish.  Perhaps if you note where you saw this someone can comment."

" I wrote in ""What I bought"" about getting Sidmool's Dr.  Galatok Galatokside Real Peptide Barrier Cream for my winter cream.   While the ingredient list is clean and sexy,  it is conspicuously free of emollients that would make it work against central heating,  which I didn't notice until after I ordered it.   I don't consider it a bad buy,  though,  as so far I've woken up with slightly brighter,  clearer skin every morning after using it.   It's just more of a gel than a cream.   But I still need a for real winter cream.   It just so happens that I saw this study: https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/5/4/60 posted on kindofstephen.com about what a bitchin anti-aging ingredient melatonin is (news to me!)  so I did a reverse search and found this delicious looking product full of acne-friendly oils and a veritable clusterbomb of antioxidants: https://skinactives.com/uv-repair-cream/  Naturally,  I'm all ""WHAAA?!?   WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING?!?!?   There are antioxidants I'd never even HEARD of in there because they're really only found in products like La Prairie serums and other obscure products.   My only real misgivings are the jar packaging and the lack of reviews.  I asked about transferring it to a pump,  but they think it's too thick.   But products with melatonin are super limited apart from Andalou Naturals and they're all full of citrus oils.  It's even cheap,  which is just kind of weird.   If anybody sees any problems with the ingredients,  please let me know.   I won't be buying it for a minute anyway. "

"So I picked up my order today and tried it this afternoon. I haven't smoked pot for a number of years now so it felt weird getting it from the post office.

&amp;#x200B;

It's sort of difficult for me to describe how it feels haha. In the past when I'v smoked high THC weed I'd usually only be able to take like 3 tokes and be stoned, or do a very small amount in a bong.

&amp;#x200B;

It mostly feels like a body high I guess, but I still feel clear headed? Mostly I just feel 'heavy' and like I don't want to get off the couch lol. Based on my lack of experience with CBD / the description on the OCS website I think I was expecting to feel more energized I guess?

&amp;#x200B;

I smoked about half a joint in 2 sittings and it hasn't given me any anxiety, so that's good. Normally after getting stoned in the past with high THC weed, the first 30 minutes or so would just be full of anxiety, give me racing thoughts, or i'd become paranoid. I think maybe if I smoked pot regularly, the tiny amount of THC in it wouldn't be making me feel heavy/tired like it is now? I'm not sure how it would feel for someone that smokes pot often.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways yeah, mostly just feel sleepy and physically relaxed."

"I recently graduated with a business degree and did it for the same reason as you!! Personally, for my concentration I chose Management. The great thing about it is that it teaches you a lot about how employees and managers are motivated and can best work to be successful. A lot of the coursework involves working in teams on semester-long projects and presentations, so you really get a lot out of the classes. You could also look into marketing (maybe as a potential minor?) but I’m not sure I’d say that it’d be the best fit for your major. I also believe there’s a general business option too, so if you aren’t quite set on choosing any of the options, I’d say look into that.

I definitely would say to steer away from choosing Information systems, accounting, finance, or decision sciences as your concentration since I believe these choices are more career/field specific. You’re required to take a few classes that cover the basics of all of these anyway. 

But yeah again, I really enjoyed management. Some of the stuff you could expect to go over in the classes are topics like innovation/creativity, the difference between managers and leaders, teams and team-building, etc. And there’s so many opportunities to get to interview with working professionals through the projects you’ll inevitably do. So I hope this helps you out a little bit!! Ironically, SF State used to have an entrepreneur major. I have no idea why they discontinued it because I definitely would have chosen that if it were still around. "

"&gt;there is no profit to farmers in abusing animals.

Your providing even the most top notch care for birds does not validate this statement. Factory farms are profiting off of the conditions that I listed. 

While you personally probably do not do all of the things that are typical of the facilities where the *vast* majority of eggs are produced, if you are trying to run any sort of profitable business from egg laying then I feel confident saying that is not going to be in line with the well being of birds. 

I'm sure as someone in this industry you are aware that male chicks are never going to lay eggs, and males of the egg laying varieties are not valuable for their meat, so they are killed shortly after birth through either maceration, gassing, or simply being tossed into trash bags to suffocate. A business that needs to make a profit to stay around would quickly be undercut by the competition if they tried to keep around an equal number of male birds to avoid cruelly slaughtering them. Similarly, I'm sure you are aware that your hens production drops as they age, eventually reaching the point where it would not be profitable for any business to keep them around for their eggs. While I hope you are nice enough to keep them around, a profitable farm would not be able to do that since their prices would be undercut by the competitors that did not do this. 

There are animal sanctuaries that rescue many chickens who have suffered immensely on factory farms and provide them with a decent quality of life, and there are many individuals who similarly choose to provide care for rescued chickens; however, these are not farmers who are trying to earn a profit.

My comment was simply pointing out that the incentives of making a profit do not all align with quality treatment of individuals. I hope you can understand that and see why any comment about ""how great I treat my birds"" is missing the point of the discussion that is taking place."

"That is a struggle.

One important question I would ask yourself is *why* you feel vulnerable about it.

That could be an outdated, learned attitude (it took me years to be able to talk openly about religion because my family made me feel that making statements about religion was very dangerous when I was a child).

*Or* it could be a valid survival instinct that some of the people in your life may not be ready/willing to talk about this subject with you. If this was not something you talked about before, perhaps you are sensing that they might perceive that you are changing and becoming a different person from the one they thought they knew, which can evoke mixed reactions.

Be gentle with yourself. There's nothing wrong with being who you are, but there's no need to make it harder on yourself either if there are people in your life who you don't feel comfortable talking to about this.

I would also ask myself ""who *are* people in my life that I feel comfortable talking to this about?"" They might be new friends, who didn't know the ""old you,"" who you feel more free to be yourself with. This is a great practicing ground.

Once you have gotten used to talking about religion and secular society with people who don't see it as strange or surprising coming from you, it will get easier and easier to talk to people who might have strong feelings about this not being part of ""who you are.""

I started out talking about religion with people I met in religious discussion groups, and after a few years I am now confidently able to honestly share my view on any religious topic, even with old family members who I was once petrified to disagree with about religious issues. It just no longer strikes me as strange because I'm so used to doing it, and having my opinion respected by other people who are interested in the same subject.

I wish you all the best! It sounds like you're at the start of a beautiful journey."

In Florida it is ten years but they can renew it for another 10 years.  Also it is possible that the judgment could create a type of lien which might make it even more complicated.

If you can't get a lawyer maybe look up the garnishment exemptions in your state on the Nolo site.  In some states they might not be able to take anything depending on your exact situation.  In others it might be as much as 15% or 25%.

" The left and right are typically defined along the lines of economic freedom vs. social freedom. 

 

The left  values social freedom over economic freedom, and tends to promote  diversity, choice, social programs and business regulations (although  this would vary from political party to political party).

Workers  and consumers who feel they are abused by employers and merchants often  gravitate towards the left seeking more regulation for employers and  merchants, and more social programs for those who are struggling.

The  right values economic freedom over social freedom,and tends to promote a  free market, social order, limited government and legislated morality  (although, again, this would vary from political party to political  party).

Business owners are often attracted  to the right because it promotes economic freedom, which makes it easier  for them to run their businesses and acquire wealth.

Religious  people who feel that society is decaying or going in the wrong  direction will often be attracted to the right for its notion of social  regulation (legislated morality), in the hopes that they can direct  society back onto what they consider is the proper path.

You  also have libertarians and authoritarians, and they don’t really fit  neatly on the left or right political scale, as seen in the chart.

The  specifics will often vary by country, but the left and right is usually  motivated by different values on economic and social liberties."

"&gt;Vaping just lets people who partook is a 0 benefit activity that harms them and other around, do it with less risk to themselves while still causing irritation to those around them. That is a 0 benefit for society.

One, people have a right to, and always had and always will do things just because they want to. Smoking is one of those things. Even with the exorbitant prices of tobacco in countries like the US or Canada, there's still ~10-20% smokers. Yes, you can hope to reduce that number progressively, but in the meantime incentivizing vaping over smoking has benefits *for the society*, like:

1. Third hand smoke eliminated
2. Less pollution (the smoke &amp; the manufacturing process) and waste (butts)
3. Less strain on the healthcare system (from smoking related conditions)

Smoking does have a benefit of some sort. People like the way it feels. Cigars are a great example of that - they're not even addictive, people just enjoy the way it feels.

In the same way, the only benefit of fast food over healthy food is that it feels good to some people. "

Plus, if you're new to the series, Part 5 is nowhere near where I'd recommend you start.  Tbh I'd probably recommend starting with Part 4 first, it has a little bit of a recap in the series, and is probably the best in the series as a complete movie."

"&gt;""Negligence has nothing (or very little) to do with whether an intruder or the Ramsey’s harmed Jonbenet.""

Well, I'm not sure about that. The Ramseys were JonBenet's legal guardians, yet they didn't bother to set the house alarm. They didn't bother to check for locked doors -- even though their bedroom was located a floor above where their kids were.

If these parents were rich enough and smart enough to enter their daughter into baby beauty pageants -- then they had enough money and brains to provide basic security for her.

This crime likely took hours. I don't know how these people could've slept through it all. The Ramseys failed to act before the crime and they also failed to act during the crime. That's what the grand jurors basically saw: failure to act -- negligence -- resulting in child abuse.

That's the case that could've been brought against the Ramseys.

[Recent example case](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/10/11/murder-trial-parents-daughter-death/1601270002/):

There is a Michigan couple that failed to provide their baby daughter with basic care. After the baby died, they claimed they loved her and had religious reasons. Nonetheless, it was determined that the baby passed away from  simple neglect. Had the parents provided the baby with basic care, she likely would have lived.

The State is taking both parents to trial.

Concerning the death of 10-month-old, Mary Anne Welch -- Seth Welch and his wife, Tatiana Fusari, were charged with **""felony murder while in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of child abuse in the first degree.""**"

It's space where it is physically impossible for anything to exist.

"The article reads like a paid piece. One misleading statement that annoyed me, too, is an assertion that if Amazon has remained on Oracle, they probably wouldn’t have experienced the problems they had moving to Aurora. In one sense this is true: migrating large databases from one vendor to another is going to result in unexpected pain. They would likely have similar pains migrating from Aurora to Oracle. Life isn’t simple with live production systems, large databases and legacy code/design. 

I’ve been using Oracle and DB2 at my job (as a software developer) for a number of years. They both have quirks in my experience, but I’m confident that both Oracle and IBM have had some of the top minds in data science tuning their respective databases. Similarly, many frighteningly smart people have contributed algorithms to Postgres that I’m sure I could never fully get my head around. I think it’s naïve to dismiss any of these top-tier databases (I include Postgres) as pieces of junk, or to universally believe one is inferior."

"Didn't he Dallas PD also throw out claims (almost instantly) saying he had a warrant, he had drugs, or weapons?  And then none of that was true?  I would think officers of the peace and justice would do their due diligence before talking to the media (almost as if to smear the character of the man that got gunned down?)

Why would they do that if they weren't trying to blow smoke into the situation?

EDIT: I had my details wrong, but here is what my memory failed to fully recall.

http://www.fox4news.com/news/search-warrant-marijuana-found-in-botham-jeans-apartment-after-deadly-shooting

https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/crime/article218333735.html

The warrant, which was signed AFTER his death, indicating that they were going to look for drugs, weapons, etc.  Then it's said marijuana was found.  If we take that at face value, then why does a marijuana possession need to result in summary execution?

If we DON'T take it at face value, then ask yourself why would they need a search warrant to look for criminal activity if it was initially indicative of fault on the police officer's part?

Then there is the story the officer gave, that she was going home, put in her key, the door pushed open, and she thought there was an intruder already inside a darkened room, a command to surrender, then gunshots.

The witnesses state that she banged on the door and yelled for him to open up.  The search warrant says she met him at the door."

Mais recentemente houve algumas celebridades que começaram a espalhar o estudo como se fosse válido (ex.: Jenny McCarthy) e tornou-se uma bola de neve ao começar a ser co-optado por grupos de conspiração contra chemtrails e afins.

Pouco demorou até teres muitos ""terapeutas"" e vendedores de produtos ""naturais"" a anunciarem tratamentos ou produtos (comercializados por eles, por coincidência) que combatiam os efeitos das vacinas e\ou serviam de alternativa.

É um bocado assoberbante a indústria que já se montou só à conta destas teorias da conspiração e não te recomendo procurar muito sobre o tema se não queres perder fé na humanidade."

"I loved it too. I was the credit/sos coordinator, its very rare that I find a job that satisfies my need for organization and creativity. I read the writing on the wall when they stopped the credit contests and got out before they eliminated the position. I miss the staff, my manager, and some of the customers so much. I had lots of issues with contractors, mostly if their escrow account wasn't paid properly ect. But in general we just really had issues with junkies and middle class homeowners. We had a contractor threaten to blow up our building once, cause we caught him stealing. Also had a junkie OD in our bathroom. I wish I could go back too, but I make more money now and have more job security where I'm at vs. A big box retailer. PS pricing coordinator freakin sucks. They trained me to cover and I told them there was no way. 😂 "
"Have you ever tried docking? It gets your boyfriend to shut up. He was being a loud mouth, as usual, until I wrapped my foreskin around his own. He was quiet then, as we both knew that we had made a special kind of connection, a connection  that we had never made before.
“It’s called docking”,  I muttered, staring deeply into his confused eyes.
“D...d...docking?”, he replied.
“Yes, just like a spaceship in Star Wars.”
Confusion left his eyes then. He understood.
“Docking”, he nodded. “Just like in Star Wars.”

"The caravan *is* politically motivated... but by *Honduran* politics, not US politics. Some tweets by @hondurassol, which is giving English-language reports of events in the country (and I don't guarantee you in any way these are 100% accurate):

&gt; This is circulating in various social media in #Honduras. It reads: “Large final victory caravan headed to #Tegucigalpa. We take him out or we emigrate” ... Several protests are planned inside country in coming week. How will the government respond? #HonduranCaravan #Crisis

&gt; Almost 1 year since the 2017 electoral crisis began, the Honduran Armed Forces delivers report to prosecutor’s office about crimes committed during protests. To date, only 1 police officer has been arrested for murder &amp; no other authorities have been held accountable #Honduras  
&gt; https://twitter.com/hondurassol/status/1054477836956758017

Honduras and Guatemala have closed their Agua Caliente border crossing to keep Hondurans from fleeing the country.  This has led to some rather dramatic events, like [this video of truckers breaking through the police line with Hondurans asylum seekers on town](https://twitter.com/SalvaPresidente/status/1053855406043336704).  There's also the government launching a disinformation campaign to discredit the caravans—reports that they are paying people in Honduras to claim they went on the caravan and turned back, and use them as propaganda.

For all that US news are talking about the big caravan in Mexico, they aren't really reporting events in Honduras.  But [Mike Pence sure is talking about them and spinning them to back Honduras' president](https://shareblue.com/mike-pence-trump-racist-attack-honduran-refugee-caravan-middle-eastern/):

&gt; Pence questioned “the idea that [people of Middle Eastern descent] would not be in this large throng,” **and claimed the president of Honduras told him that the caravan “was organized by leftist groups in Honduras, financed by Venezuela, and sent north to challenge our sovereignty and challenge our border.”**"

It's definitely not long wear and probably one of the most fussy, frustrating foundations I've ever used.

To argue the democrats have been even as close in terms of glorifying violence is out of touch."

"&gt; Turned out the GID for the user in question was set to 1089 which doesn't even exist on that server.. corrected it and now it works as it should.

That's a classic of network configuration, it happens all the time. Same group name, different GID. This happens with users also -- same user name, different numerical ID.

&gt; I seem to recall that you needed to go with arcfour or no encryption to get NFS performance.

No, encryption doesn't really affect performance because the process is I/O limited (when writing to storage devices). So no significant impact there.

&gt; What encryption are you using if any?

The usual SSH encryption. It's a common mistaken belief that encryption significantly slows transfers down. The advantage of using the default encryption is that you can transfer data across the Internet with a very high degree of security.

&gt; I fail to see how scp or rsyncing files between computers will save you any time?

Well, there's the backup issue. Rsync in particular is very efficient, because it examines two directory trees and copies only changed files. So after a slow initial backup, rsync is very fast for incremental updates.

And because of the increasing popularity of SSH, sftp has been integrated into, and can be used with, Linux file browsers to allow remote filesystem browsing with no setup required. Just:

       sftp://username@servername/path/

Two side-by-side file browsers, one set up as above, another local, and you can drag &amp; drop files and folders across the network. Particularly useful when the remote system is out somewhere in the world.

"My two aunts lived in the same house , one had been married for like 10 years and living there and other had been newly wed . For some reason they had misunderstandings going on between them .I was never the one to care about others' matters so i didn't care about anything .Anyways i went to visit them and spent most of the time with my cousins just hanging out and stuff , i'm a shy guy so i don't interact that much with everyone and no one seems to have a problem with me so everything went normal for the time I was there . Fast forward to a week later when I was at home my mom recieved a call from my other aunt , some real shit went down there after i came back home and then my newly wed aunt proceeds to tell my mom that I had showed her recordings of my other aunt talking shit about her behind her back , that i had recorded the conversations on my cellphone and then I had showed it to her when i was there, my mom asked me and ofcourse i had no fkn idea what she was talking about . That was the last time i went there ."

Or maybe it's just me not being used to such a general string type, and compiler will really optimize everything away. Anyway, it's worth moving `string_ref` into `std` namespace and perhaps making it a recommended handle for returning strings with unobvious ownership.

I guess, one can think of `status_code&lt;erased&lt;T&gt;&gt;` not as of some specialization (an erased kind of `status_code`s), but as of `status_code&lt;T&gt;`, where `T` is marked with `erased` marker type — both for documentation purposes and to enable some features in `status_code&lt;T&gt;`."

"&gt;The burden of proof is in the person who makes a claim, not those that don’t but into it. 

Burden of proof generally only refers to situations where finding out what the ""right"" answer is actually matters. Like proving where someone was on the night of a murder. Or proving that you do or don't have a disability for some sort of disability payment. When two people believe different things, the fact that one person wants to convince the other person they are wrong does not matter, and does not need burden of proof to be applied in a strict sense.

It also exists in a loose sense to guide discussion, though. It doesn't really matter then, but it's a good rule of thumb to make sure it's a productive discussion. Then, it isn't about ""who is making a claim"". You are both making a claim. He is making a claim that god exists, you are making a claim that god doesn't. Burden of proof isn't about which claim is more extraordinary, either. It's about who is challenging who. He isn't challenging other people's beliefs. Other people are challenging his. Therefore the burden of proof lies with him.

For what it's worth, I don't even agree with him. I'm an atheist. I just think you're using shitty logic and trying to look like you're intellectually superior, throwing terms like burden of proof around without really knowing what they mean. Kinda makes other atheists look a little dumber.

&gt;I give the probability of the judaeo Christian supernatural claims being about as likely as unicorns existing

To be honest, that's a disingenuous argument. We can pretty conclusively say that no unicorns exist, because we can say ""hey, we've been about in these parts and we haven't seen a unicorn, when we would expect to have seen one"". As opposed to believing in a god, who some people believe lives in heaven, some people believe in as more of a metaphysical thing or an ideal, or other weird shit that doesn't exist in reality. We have a lot more grounds to say unicorns don't exist than god.

A better example would be something like believing a coelacanth exists. Thought to have gone extinct at the end of the cretaceous period, it's speculated that it would have lived in extreme deep sea environments, and if it still existed today, we wouldn't know about it - and one or two fish have been caught that seemed extremely similar. So it's possible it could exist.

Well, that's what I thought anyway, because that's what I was taught when I was younger. Looking up how to spell its name, turns out they've gone from ""speculating"" to confidently stating it exists after finding many more. So that's something. Not really expecting the same thing is gonna happen with someone proving deity existence, but hey, pre-discovery coelacanth speculation is still a better analogy than the unicorn, because we didn't really have any basis for ruling it out."

"&gt; So if Toronto is 50% non-white, why aren’t we seeing more non-white candidates run? 

They do run, and they usually lose, often because of the disadvantage that they have compared to incumbents, or fundraising disadvantages when they come from poorer communities.

&gt; I’m also not convinced that reducing policing is something that strongly resonates with Torontonians — especially after the latest rash of gang violence this year. 

I agree with you, but when city council is dealing with issues like carding, it's important to have voices from the communities that are actually affected by those issues."

"I enjoy wandering around cemeteries.  It's fascinating and I find them so peaceful and inspiring, usually a lot of effort went into them - especially in Victorian times with all the ornate landscaping.

You see all these stones and you wonder who these people were, what their lives were like, how they were once just like you.

A lot of old Victorian cemeteries are very much still in use, modern stones opposite ones from the 1920s.  Two of my local Victorian cemeteries are still in use with deaths so recent I can remember what I was doing that day.

You get the occasional family plot with a very old stone, very archaic lettering and the original dates are from the 1950s, then you notice the bottom has been scrubbed clean and has the same archaic font spelling out 2016 or whatever.  Some sad things like ""Mary Bloggs - Died 1967 aged 46 years"" - and ""Her Husband Donald - Died 2012 aged 92 years"".  45 years without her."

It was usually coming back out from halftime when warming back up 
"You make no arguments, you're just saying that the diplo hit when separate-peacing a co-bell country makes the co-belligerent option useless. No, it does not. Choosing an enemy ally as co-belligerent in a war:

\- Allows you to peace out with the enemy war leader (single peace-out for the whole alliance) and take provinces from both the enemy war leader AND the co-belligerent ally at the normal war-score cost and without it costing you diplo points. Strategically, this makes most sense in a scenario where you have claims in both countries that cost less than 100% warscore in total.

\- It also allows you to separate-peace the co-belligerent enemy ally and take provinces for them at a normal war-score cost, whereas, were they not co-belligerent, provinces would cost double the normal war-score.

Hence, you are wrong in saying that the co-belligerent option has no use just because you take a diplo hit when you separate-peace the co-belligerent for provinces. If you separate-peace an enemy ally who isn't co-belligerent and take provinces from them, it will cost you twice the warscore, and you will be able to annex two times less development in the peace deal. Hence, choosing a country as co-belligerent very much has a use despite the diplo hit.

You could argue that there shouldn't be a diplo hit when separate peacing for claimed co-belligerent provinces, but on the other hand it could be a balance check to not make blobbing too easy. I, personally, am content with how it works now because I find blobbing too easy as is. Thank you."

"I also figured Fighting is long overdue and has a lot of potential. Heres my ideas,

Also potential for Mega Medicham, Mega Heracross, and even Mega Lopunny. Hericross could get a new figure, thats actually useable.  

Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, and Hitmontop are all yet to be released, which would be awesome to have and a badass ex trio.  

Team them up the a new EX Machamp. He derserves a better piece. 

There plenty of other new figures that could be released, in Throh and Sawk, the Conkelhurr line, Scrafty, Mienshao, Passiman, Crabrawler, and possibly Moletta.  

And personally, id love to see a bit of a buff on Riolu. He extremely difficult to evolve, which then makes Lucario a MASSIVE threat. His saving grace is his shockwave, which has saved more from a surrounded goal point on multiple occasions. Id up his attacks to 50 and 40 damage, and add to his ability never having wait. As it stands, Riolu's inner focus prevents him from having wait, but only when hes on the field. If he could come right out of the P.C. and never have wait on the bench as well, its go a long way. Im a huge Riolu/Lucario fan, so i really want this buff."

"Wasn't 1.3 the result of yet another world tier and gear score added that pushed NPC values through the roof? At least from my memory, there has bee no one that said ""we need higher TTK"" in 1.2. Tbh, I think it is highly unfair to blame anyone on 1.3 except maybe Massive that should have tested it before. Then again, they were just trying to quick fix SMGs and gear differences due to unbalanced Dark Zone.

[https://youtu.be/tX7QLm5D\_5Q?t=3508](https://youtu.be/tX7QLm5D_5Q?t=3508) Basically all Youtubers agreed on the state of the game in 1.2, the DZ was unbalanced.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://youtu.be/yXR7NM\_tZ34?t=3412](https://youtu.be/yXR7NM_tZ34?t=3412) Also here, Marco directly states that Division is unplayable for casual soloplayers in 1.3.

&amp;#x200B;

I read your comments on 1.4, and I think you just lack the ability to see that your opinion is not the sole truth, also you only seem to focus on the Youtube that you didn't agree with, although other content would even be directly in line with your thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, 1.3 was unbalanced for soloplayers, but there is 0 reason to blame Youtube for this, it was just the next step up in world tier that crossed the line of balanced PvE cause of stat scaling.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe 1.4 was good for you, but for Skill Up and me and the people I played with, it was more of a disaster than 1.3 was. Apparently it started raining loot out of nowhere, I was done playing for all my builds in 3 days or so. I have been bored and stopped playing till Challenging Incursions and Legendary missions were added way later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Massive just didn't anticipate on people playing solo I think, they took way to long to implement group scaling, so obviously when you compare someone who stays on top of TD1 in a group like Youtubers will have a different experience from a casual soloplayer."

"For me, they could leave nearly everything else exactly the same as long as the world itself got the attention it deserves.

I posted this as a response to someone lower, but it is an answer to your prompt too so I figured I'd copy it as a top-level comment too:

&gt;For a realm that's supposedly been settled (by the current owners, anyway - more on that in a moment) for two centuries, there's apparently been shockingly little expansion. One city, and a small fishing town - how can they alone sustain the economy that Gransys supposedly has? How much fish can Gran Soren possibly need, and what is Cassardis getting in return, considering everything there seems locally made? Where are all those traders on the roads going?

&gt;Second point: we need way more worldbuilding/lore. Yes, DD does have its share of rather complicated lore, but it's all focused on the dragon cycle, with the general setting getting very little love. Gransys is beautiful, with lots of things to see and discover - yet most of them are essentially meaningless and devoid of any real context. Who built Aernst and Heavenspeak? As decayed as they are there's no way they were constructed in the last 200 years... yet from the sound of things they're not anywhere near as ancient as Bluemoon - different civilizations? Likewise, there's not information - even pawn chatter - relating to the fascinating remains of the cliff dwellings on the road to Bluemoon.

&gt;And then there's other seemingly important points of interest that got the same lack of treatment - Conqueror's Sanctuary, Bloodwater Beach and the surrounding area comes immediately to mind. As do the Proving Grounds - like what even is that place? A giant arena under the Shadowfort, but seemingly not related since it's not connected (other than by goblin tunnels), and on the map it's bang on center of a clearing in the mountains past the fort. Maybe originally intended to give the player access to the frontier itself?

&gt;I'm not (usually) the sort of person who needs ""all the answers,"" but when a game (or any other fictional setting) acts as if there's not even a question to be answered it just feels like such a waste of potential"

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

For the past year, my current roommate has been splitting a 2 bedroom basement apartment. I was kind of desperate for a new roommate as my old roommate bailed with minimum notice. So, I chose her to fill the room. She brought two dogs into our tiny apartment (one of the dogs is big). She seemed to be a good person after our initial meeting, so I decided to accept the application. After learning more about her, I now know she is crazy. She has had a tough life, but plays the victim to the fullest degree.

We have had two severe altercations over the past year. The first one she was definitely in a mentally ill state. I was on the computer in my room (door closed). She threw a shoe at my door but of nowhere. I went out and said ""what the hell?"" Of course she immediately started screaming and telling me I poisoned her water and was sneaking into her room at night. Didn't end in anything serious except a shouting match. Since then I have tried to have as little contact with her as possible while trying to maintain the cleanliness of the apartment (she is the dirtiest human being I have met on top of having shedding dogs). I have learned that logical solutions such as compromises do not work in her head. She just starts screaming. Or just won't hold up her end of the bargain.

Fast forward to last week. I get off work late around 1:30am from a gala dinner. I walk into the house and take off my shoes. I then walk to the door in my room and step in half cleaned up dog vomit. Frustrated, I take off my socks and walk into the kitchen. Immediately, I step in what looks to be dog piss on the tiled kitchen (later find out it's dog bile...which is supposed to be better). Now furious, I text her to clean up the vomit and piss in the kitchen (she had been home all day). She responds with the text ""I already did."" I then text her back saying it was half cleaned up and she didn't even try to clean the kitchen. I then confronted her in person and told her this was not acceptable. She immediately starts screaming at me saying ""not now!"" over and over. It turns into a shouting match, even as I remain calm for the majority of the screaming. Finally, I lose my control and aggressively lunge at her with my hands raised, yelling at her face. It ends there, but now I feel like I crossed the line (with my own standards). She brings out the worst in me. I haven't yelled at someone like that since highschool. I can't leave the living arrangement until February (I'm leaving the country on a work visa, can't sign another lease agreement). I do control the apartment in a cleanliness and utility fashion because I have to. I would live in filth otherwise. I can't talk to her reasonably so I ignore her. Am I the asshole? I just don't feel like I have any other options and I can see why she has been abused in the past.

Choice is useless when you can't afford any options at all. As it happens, we still have private health insurance options, so the choice is still there if you want to pay extra.

"Imma go at this keeping in mind that you are a Christian man and are having trouble with the grief of this time. 

My dude, it sounds like you were in love with that little baby as soon as there was a hint of his/her existence. Most people think that’s a given but it’s not, a lot of people freak out or regret the pregnancy. Sounds like you both  jumped right in with enthusiasm.  That’s some mad unconditional love right there. That’s some God-sent miracle based love right there. 

Not enough of that in the world. So, give yourselves pats on the back for loving another being you never met so much you feel grief at the loss of them. 

What happened to you and your lady is awful, it really is. No matter what anyone says about how “early” it was or any of that, just ignore it. Ignore any crappy advice/comments thrown your way.

Your pain is pain. You have to grieve however you feel you have to grieve. It will take time, it sucks to hear that but it sucks worse to FEEL that reality. The only advice I could offer is to maybe (when you are ready) is to reach out to your pastor (or any local church you feel comfortable with) and ask to get some personal counsel.

"I own a 2008 honda odyssey, I spent a month in it, Its tight but doable. Id kbb the value of the van your looking at though. I got mine from craigslist, for 3000 at around the same miles, with all the bells and whistles. But I guess it all depends on location too.

I vandwelled during the summer for about a month. I used a portable ac unit for cooling while not running the engine. (You'll need a shore power location though.) At first the way the seats lay flat doesnt leave the floor completely flat. Which if you dont have decent bedding can be uncomfortable. (I had a thick foam single wide matteres pad that worked well enough. But you may want to use a board or something to help level the floor out more. I had a 300w inverter and a 250w inverter. To keep laptop/phone charged and to run a 19in tv. My phone was a wifi hot spot for my laptop/tv viewing.

 The van while idleing seems to use up alot of fuel, so overnight idle isnt recomended. And a 10,000btu portable ac unit bearly kept the van cool in the shade, with full tinted windows, during the summer. 

Ive owned the van for a few years and the only real issue ive had with it was an evap error, that for the life of me I cant fix. I tighten the intake and it goes away just to come back later... I replace some hoses, same thing. I'm currently trying to find out where the ""small evap leak"" is coming from now, with little luck. (Might be mechanic time)

"My parents got taken for a ride by their ISP and it drives me mad.

Years ago I was in the process of helping them find a better internet deal as their service was terrible and their contract was about to run out. Then dad received a phone call from a telemarketer who duped him into a ridiculously expensive and poor quality ADSL2 plan, despite fibre optics being available in his area.

Years later this contract runs out and we start the process again.

Another telemarketer rings up and sells my dad a ridiculously expensive plan bundled with a deal basic cable package. Almost two years later and they don't even use cable. 

I suggested my dad revert to a basic internet package and get Netflix. His ironic response was ""when do I have time to watch TV?"".

My poor dad. Hard working man. Always provided for his family. Suffered so we didn't have to. Started at the bottom and never got a free lunch on his short trip up the ladder. Watched his kids grow up into successful adults with families of their own. Couldn't keep up with technology and got duped by a salesman making an unsolicited call. I know it embarrasses him too. Makes my blood boil."
"I think he said it was most likely the 3rd, but he couldn't remember the actual call. 

Here's my basic point:  the only apparent purpose of the call was or could be to verify information about Teresa's car.  But there is no plausible reason for why he would be doing so if he was looking at the car. In that event, he would be lying for some nefarious reason, but there is no reason that makes any sense.  Leaving the conclusion there is no reason to think he was looking at the car or doing anything other than what he said.

I just figured to post this so that people under 10K, and others around my number, know that they aren't all lost in the system or anything like that.  I can't guarantee anything, but only say that I've had success emailing HelloOCS, and they let me know my order status.

"&gt;I think you need to work on your reading comprehension.

Ouch, glass houses, buddy.

The dictionary definition of a ""supplement"" is *""something that completes or enhances something else when added to it.""* By that definition, anything you eat is a supplement since your diet is comprised entirely of multiple components that complete your diet when combined.

The definition of a ""dietary supplement"" is *""a product taken orally that contains one or more ingredients (such as vitamins or amino acids) that are intended to supplement one's diet and are not considered food.""*

So either the person was using the literal definition, which would be superfluous since *anything* you eat could be classified as a supplement (even real meat), or they were using the dietary definition, which would be incorrect."

&gt;That's like you saying you don't want me to wear a yellow shirt, because bees are yellow, and you have trypophobia. In reality, the yellow shirt will not trigger your trypophobia.

And my whole post is about the fact that you can not tell me what does and does not offend or harm me.  You are not the arbiter.  They are the arbiters.  And the black community, as a whole, has said, time and time again, please don't wear black face in costumes, even if you just want to be lando. 

This is a commonly understood social reality.  They asked you not to.  It doesn't matter if that doesn't *seem* like the ""same type"" of black face to *you* because you are not the one *for which black face was designed to wound and dehumanize*, so you really to don't get to decide the classifications of black face and tell people which one is OK and which one isn't.

Black face is painting black makeup on your face to resemble a black person.  It doesn't matter if you're doing it with the express purpose of doing a minstrel show or to be Barack Obama.  It matters that you did it, as a white man, knowing the history, knowing the implication.

"Do some research into people that have bought or tried to buy OTP in the last 2-3 years (particularly Melb/Syd/Perth). There is a number of stories about people who have signed a contract to buy apartments OTP and come time to settle the bank values the actual apartment well below purchase price (a large glut of extra apartments whos approvals to build all went through at the same and the buildings were all finished about the same time is a major factor in this, falling property markets of course will be another). 
The buyers are then screwed as they don't have the funds for the agreed purchase price and risk losing their deposit due to breach on contract. 

Personally I think you should wait it out and keep saving that deposit. Ideally 20% of final purchase price but even more would be better. Good luck OP"

Open a channel of communication with her so that she knows that even though you love her very much, this does affect how you view her.

Be supportive about listening to any root causes of the weight gain BEFORE you mention anything about how you view her. When a partner is floundering like this, it’s important to make it known that you can see it and that their well-being is being considered. People always want to jump to fixing the symptoms but this is your life partner - helping her deal with the cause of the problem will likely improve your relationship as a whole. "

&gt;I don’t say that because I’m particularly liberal and want to shift the whole country to the liberal agenda. I say that because I’m particularly American and I want to put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy and politics. President Trump has spent two years attacking our best values — truth and trust — and I believe that Democrats getting a lever of power is necessary, but not sufficient, to reverse that.

Because there is a basic respect for truth, science and decency in the Democratic caucus and because I know that two more years of the G.O.P. holding every lever of power and blindly following Trump’s basic disrespect for truth, science and decency will make it impossible to elevate America’s best values.

&gt;Truth without power today is just background Muzak to the march of the Trump administration.

&gt;You see, I can write that it is vitally important for global stability and the protection of journalists everywhere that those who executed and ordered the murder of Khashoggi be punished. But if Democrats do not control either the House or the Senate, I fear Trump will try to avoid any meaningful U.S. censure of Riyadh or its top leaders, if they are proven culpable.

&gt;I can write that the president, by telling us that we must weigh a $110 billion Saudi arms purchase against taking a moral stand on Khashoggi’s murder, is literally telling us the price of our values — about $333.33 for every American. (Your check is in the mail.) But if you think, as I do, that countries that sell out their core values for financial gain suffer in the long run or if you think that such a country is not the America you want us to be, and that the world needs us to be, then you need to vote for a Democrat for the House and the Senate.

&gt;I can write that a president who praises a U.S. politician who body slammed a journalist for politely asking a valid question — and who is utterly indifferent to the plight of jailed democracy advocates and journalists from Egypt to Turkey to the Arabian Peninsula to the Philippines — is giving license to thugs all over the world. But that criticism will never have any impact if Democrats control neither the House nor the Senate.

&gt;I can write that it is unconscionable that the president of the United States simply dismissed as political spin the latest report by the U.N.’s team of climate scientists — warning that if we don’t undertake immediate carbon emission reductions to prevent global average temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and not let the increase hit 2 degrees, we will be condemning the next generation to a world of environmental hurt by the end of the century.

&gt;I can even quote The Economist magazine’s summary of that hurt: “Arctic summers could be ice-free once a decade in a two-degree world, but once a century in a one-and-a-half-degree one. Virtually all the ocean’s coral might be irreversibly wiped out in a two-degree world, rather than 70-90 percent if temperatures rise by less. Sea levels may rise an extra 10 cm, washing away the livelihoods of millions more people. Permitting a rise of two degrees could also see an extra 420M people exposed to record heat.”

&gt;But not a finger will be lifted to prevent any of these devastating outcomes unless Democrats control at least the House or the Senate.

&gt;I can write that the growing tribalization of our politics, the notion that members of the other party are not just opponents but “enemies” who must be crushed, is being fueled by a president who has no desire to be president of all the people, but rather only his base, and who delights in dividing us and insulting people, thereby debasing his office. But it will be impossible to impose any accountability on Trump for his toxic behavior and reverse the tone of incivility that has overtaken U.S. politics if the Democrats do not control either the House or the Senate.

&gt;I can write that it is impossible to have a healthy democracy when our president spews a steady stream of lies every day, has denounced the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, refused to take seriously Russian interference in our elections and still has not revealed his tax returns. But this president will continue soiling our institutions and his office unless Democrats control at least the House or the Senate and can impose penalties for such corrosive behavior.

&gt;I could write that one reason the Saudis probably thought they could cross a red line with their depraved murder of Khashoggi was that Trump never appointed an ambassador to Riyadh — relying instead on his and his son-in-law’s personal contacts with the Saudi ruler — and because Trump regularly denounced journalists as purveyors of fake news. Why Trump never sent an ambassador to Saudi Arabia needs to be investigated, but it won’t if Democrats do not control the House or the Senate.

&gt;In sum, words today are not enough, investigative journalism is not enough, television special reports are not enough, documentaries are not enough, endless columns and editorials calling out Trump are not enough — even an audiotape of Khashoggi being killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul may not be enough — because the truth is just not enough today — not as long as we have a president who has no shame, who is backed by party that has no spine, that controls the House, the Senate, the White House, the Supreme Court and, indirectly, a major television network that has no integrity.

&gt;One day I hope the truth will be enough again. One day I hope great journalism will be enough again. But today only a lever of power — the House or the Senate — will make it so. Facts, science and truth — without power — are just leaves floating through the air in the age of Trump, scattering aimlessly without impact.

&gt;**So, this year: No third party, no Green Party, no throwing up our hands and saying, “They’re all bad.” All of that’s for another day. For today, in these midterm elections, vote for a Democrat, canvass for a Democrat, raise money for a Democrat, drive someone else to a voting station to vote for a Democrat. It’s the only hope to make America America again.**

"I'm sorry like I said I'm in two Discord groups and I've never seen anybody besides myself with issues. The only thing that I have issues with is the fact that I Can't Get Enough gifts to send out to people. Both my Discord groups understand that I live in a rural area and they send me gifts all the time, and whenever I'm out like I said in my other comment, I wish I had enough gifts so I could return the love. And that's insane, I knew that you were going to take that one point that I had about it being easy and run with it... That's not what I'm trying to say, the game isn't even that easy. Like I have been playing since October of last year and I finally just got a kobra for the first time. I still have 5 pokemon until I complete the Kanto region of my Pokedex. And I'm a pretty decently hardcore player I would consider myself. But to me the fact that you're saying this is remotely easy, whenever they specifically give past like the Celebi and Mew task that are intended to last for a long time. Like literally what do you want? It's not that big of a deal. What do you even want to be harder about it? You're not even specifying anything all you're saying is that specific things got easier but what do you want to be hard LOL? I'm sorry but if you're going to say anything about catches, as a real player that only has a limited window of time to go into town and get a specific about a balls, I think it's bullshit that I have to throw for Ultra Balls at a Turtwig getting an excellent throw every time. Like literally unless you're a rural player or ever have been, you really don't have any room to talk. Like I don't want to hear it, I'm a mother of a 10 month old and I still found the time to walk into town in like 40 degree weather and it took me about 45 minutes to even get there, and it took me about an hour and a half to get to 5 pokestops and 4 gyms. Like I literally bust my ass to go Pokemon hunting, I have to find rides to get into town, and if I don't then I walked. The fact that you're literally just Downing every single rural player is amazing to me. I bust my ass man and nobody's going to take that away from me."

You can also set the monitor to 1:1, so the 1080p image will be display in the center of the screen with black bars on top and bottom. This results in no scaling artifacts, but the viewable window is smaller.

"Thanks for the ideas, everyone. Unfortunately, the problem isn't solved yet.

Increasing the closing force doesn't help, even at the max setting. I have reduced it to a very low setting for now.

When I disengage the opener and manually operate the door, it stays within an inch or so from where I leave it -- whether that is halfway down, fully down, or fully up. It is level and not loose or wobbly. For the most part, it's not difficult to open or close. The only thing I notice is that, when closing the door, each time a pair of rollers reaches the curved section of track, there is a moment where the resistance increases quite a bit. Once the roller passes into the curve, the resistance returns to normal."

"&gt; Any reasonable person doesn't listen to Trump and think, ""I should body slam a liberal today."" Any reasonable person does not go to a baseball game and shoot republicans because of health care. Any reasonable person places the blame on those individuals and not the parties they are part of.

I’m in partial agreement with you here, but when one’s leaders are constantly pointing at a perceived enemy, and excusing and encouraging and supporting violence against that perceived enemy, then I have reason to suspect that maybe that leadership had a hand in violence against this perceived enemy they are painting.

Maybe they cultivated, through their words, less than reasonable people to commit acts of violence.

Notice I never said Trump is definitely responsible for these actions, I’m sure we’ll find that whoever made and distributed these bombs has more than one loose screw, but doesn’t Trump in his position have a responsibility to use his platform in a way that doesn’t encourage acts of violence? That doesn’t echo the words of authoritarians of the past? That doesn’t paint his opposition as violent, destructive agents hell bent on ruining the country?

Not to excuse some of the rhetoric that comes from very left wing news outlets that print very divisive rhetoric about the republicans or not to excuse the rhetoric of partisan followers who say these sorts of things in chat rooms. 

&gt; Trump is of the rival party so you're willing to read more into it. It's like watching a comedian that's vaguely edgy, laughing and laughing and having a good time, and ""hey man, don't be offended, they're just jokes, we can lau- uh... did he just make a gay joke? This motherfucker just made a gay joke and gays are oppressed in this country and suddenly these are statements and not jokes!""

Except I have no reason to believe Trump is joking about any of the above statements.  If Trump is an edgy comedian than his 5 minutes is full of “jokes” which aren’t jokes but excuses to say harmful divisive things and then turn around and say “what? I’m a comedian.”  Except most of the audience isn’t laughing, most of the audience is disturbed and frightened

And I’ve asked you provide more sample rhetoric from “my side”, preferably a pattern of behavior from an individual, that would show me that the left is engaging in similar rhetoric in the opposite direction.  All I see is one Nancy Pelosi quote against a plethora of Trump quotes.  

I think it’s interesting you claim:
&gt; Trump is of the rival party so you're willing to read more into it

But can the same not be said in the opposite direction for you? Trump is of the same party so you’re willing to read less into it?

I’m not trying to claim that other republican leaders and elected officials at the same level of national attention are engaging in this rhetoric - I’ve seen many current and former republican officials renounce the rhetoric.  

So, again, while Trump isn’t directly responsible for these bombings, he has a history of rhetoric which serves to potentially motivate and encourage these less than reasonable individuals that can’t be ignored.  It’s circumstantial, and we’ll probably never be able to pin Trump’s rhetoric to these extremists actors, but let’s not pretend there’s no way they could be connected. "

I was using small apples because they had an awesome explosion when they hit their mark!

Someone with even remote training with the weapon, with multiple summers of practice and nothing better to do when watching the flock than to sling rocks around could I'm sure could get extremely accurate with one. I think it's just hard to imagine until you see it happen. 

Like pole vaulting. Without knowing it's possible, it would make no sense for a human to propel themselves 15' in the air with just a stick, but high school boys all around the country can do that. And pro athletes records break the 20' mark.

"That's been my complaint in PCars2 as well... but then you gotta realize that it's a double-edged sword. 

My thinking was enable the damage so that the fools and morons will wreck themselves in the first lap or two and then the rest of us can have a nice race. The problem with this is that the fools and morons really hate wrecking only themselves, they always try to take more people with them and what you could end up with is half the field getting crashed out by some fool in T1 and it destroys the race for these people. Leaving the damage off at least lets everyone complete the race, yes you may still get crashed out in T1 but at least you can go on after that.

Ideally yes, I'd love to have fully realistic damage always on but it can really be a pain depending on who you are racing against. I'm usually pretty comfortable turning on damage for my racing vs AI, but in multiplayer I'm still undecided..."

"That you ""scientifically"" usually have a phenotype that can be described broadly as either male or female (Let's ignore intersex people for now) is cool and all, but that is different from gender.

Gender is the social construct that we have built up partly around these phenotypes, but what constitutes ""Man"" and ""Woman"" is culturally dependent. In some cultures it is manly to have long hair, in some it is not, in some it is manly to do certain kinds of work that are not gender coded in others, same for clothing (Trousers were initially dismissed by the Romans as girly, now they're unisex after having been the strict domain of men for some time). Since gender is societally constructed and denotes culturally defined roles, such roles could theoretically be infinite in number. Third genders have traditionally existed in some cultures, occupying a third niché in these culturally defined roles. "

"Alright, I'm going to try to provide one emotional answer, and one logical answer.
I'll start with emotion: If you've ever seen footage of an abortion, you'll know how hellish the whole thing is. When all is said and done, there's a half formed human on the operating table. It's limbs ripped up, it's brains sucked out. Dead. It's dead. It was going to be a person but now it's dead. And the would be parent has to live with that for the rest of their life. It's horrible. Often necessary, but horrible. A woman should be able to get therapy for that kind of thing. They should be treated with love and respect, not yelled at, or called a baby killer, or shunned from society as many people who get abortions are.
Now for the logical argument: In america you either hate abortion and think it's the devil, or love abortion and want it everywhere. Any other compromise or position is ignored. You have lobbyists from both sides fighting viciously over who wins. They fight so much that a stable system really isn't possible. When the democrats are in power, you can get an abortion. When the republicans are in power, you can't. So your ability to get what you need is limited based on what year and state you're in. We need an unbiased system that has the ability to look at each case and decide if an abortion is okay. We need compromise. We need compassion. We need middle ground. We need support."

"Wouldn't one prefer someone who is honest about why their feelings are changing, as opposed to him finding other outlets to satisfy his sexual pleasures.

Yes only caring about the gap is pretty dumb but if the gap is his many point of attraction, wouldn't it be better he be up front about it. Different people have different fetish/attractions. For some it's height, for some weight, for other it could be feet, for him it's the gap. 

An honest person in a relationship is better than someone who holds in his feelings and starts cheating because they have to find a sexual outlet."

"All the attempts failed... this guy must be really really dumb to not understand the political implications and pushback. Also dumb enough to not be able to build a detonating bomb. That's a pretty high level of stupidity on many levels. Yah it's possible.

It's also possible that someone intelligent sent out these fake bombs without hopes of harming anyone in order to rally up the troops into voting Democrat in the midterms. The timing makes me think that this is a more likely scenario but of course this is all speculation at this point.

If the bombs are shown to be intended not to detonate, I think we can safely say it was a false flag by an an anti Trump/ republican activist. It's not like there is a shortage of these activists. The media and social networks have people in a constant moral panic against the Trump administration. 

This is not an unlikely scenario that should just be discarded, nor should it be believed immediately. It's just an important angle to consider. I think the timing is far too important for this to be considered just a stupid irrational act. If the FBI acts slow on this and we don't receive important details before the midterms... people are going to suspect democrat participation in these actions."

Is this really one of the biggest problems? I would argue this is *a* problem. A much bigger problem is the inability of new housing production to meet the demand of an increasing population.

I agree with this, and think this would be a much better solution (see Measure W).

"Kia ora, Mr Speaker. Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou, kia ora.

It is absolutely disgusting that Māori land can still be forcefully acquired by the crown. For too long, Māori have suffered injustices at the hand of colonialism and the government of New Zealand. Māori land is, and always will be, Māori land- the land of our tangata whenua. More than 90% of the land Māori once had has been stolen, placed into the hands of colonial oppressors. In the modern day, I’m sure many Kiwis don’t think that a civilised society would let this happen. But today, the government and the Crown still have the power to forcefully take our taonga promised to us in te Tiriti- our Māori land- from us.

Mr Speaker, I am glad to be bringing this bill before the house both as the Minister of Māori Affairs.  Māori land has been passed down by whakapapa for generations, continously- it is akin to a sacred tradition. We cannot allow the Crown to continue forcibly taking land from Māori, and that is why this bill is before us today.

Thank you, Mr Speaker."

Sure prices are a really important economic signal that supply is low (and that goes for supply of goods or services) in an ideal situation price rising signals to everyone money can be made selling that good or service, supply goes up to full the gap then price falls due to competing supply. When price controls are in place the signals aren't accurate supply can be very low with prices staying low causing shortages, or supply can be very high as well as price signaling there's money to be made when there isn't causing companies to overproduce something with no need.

If you were to bring it up now, I think it would be extremely discouraging to her. If you would have expressed all of this before her weight loss journey began, it would have been a super shitty conversation, but maybe a better time."

"If you’re interested to know the motivation behind treating subtraction as the addition of a negative, well, if you start from “group axioms” then you only have a single operator (which you can make an “additive group” with if you treat that operator as “addition” in which case we *need* to define subtraction in terms of addition because addition is the only operation we have! Seperate to that but also one of the requirements of it being a group is the axiom of “associativity” on the operator. To exemplify this with addition, “7+(8+9)” could be rewritten as “(7+8)+9” but “7-(8-9)” could not be written as “(7-8)-9”, so addition is associative but subtraction isn’t, so we can have an additive group but not a subtractive group. On top of having an “additive group”, addition is “Abelian” meaning you can swap the order of operands and the result is the same; “3+4” is the same as “4+3”, but “3-4” is not the same as “4-3”, BUT... “3+(-4)” IS the same as “(-4)+3”!

Most likely, there is either an issue with the GPU driver or it's faulty. [Get DDU](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) and do a complete removal of the GPU driver before downloading and installing a fresh one from AMD.

Just like a flat 2d being can only see and move through a small part of the 3d world. So if you could travel through time, you would control the 4th dimension in the same way we control the first 3. And then maybe the 5th dimension is the probability of events occurring, and if you control that you're God."

"[Phil Spencer is down with it](http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/03/xboxs_phil_spencer_is_still_open_to_banjo_and_kazooie_appearing_in_super_smash_bros)

From a more logical standpoint...Microsoft is very, very clearly losing this generation of console wars.  They have nothing to lose by getting exposure on the other platforms.  If there's a chance Banjo-Kazooie in Smash could get more eyes on Xbox, Microsoft, and its other properties, they would be crazy not to do it."

"There's no question that the countries the US attacks are dangerous, and the leaders they depose are horrible, but doing that always makes things worse, not better. Was ISIS better than Saddam Hussein? Decades of US interventions have helped to keep these countries permanently fucked up and dangerous, and haven't achieved the political changes or stability the US leaders *claimed* to want.

Though if what they *actually* wanted was to make work for defence contractors..."
Why would Trump do that? It's pretty obvious that he prefers doing business with them over caring about human rights. Bringing the family to the US would just put more pressure on him. Trump probably just want this story to go away.

"The ESPN app is nigh unusable during the world series.

"You are correct. Libertarian free will is difficult to describe, and it’s even harder to describe a world where it was the case. If I were to try to describe such a world, I would have to describe a world that defied causality. Causes would be disconnected from their effects, and you likely couldn’t use the past to define the present or future. 

Now, if this was the case, the causes of your actions would likewise be free from the past. While this abides by the libertarian definition of free will, it would also mean that *you* would not cause your actions. Your thoughts, desires, your decisions, all could not, by definition, result in the actions you desire. In other words, anything you did wouldn’t be because *you* wanted to do it. It would just happen.

If I asked random people what they meant by free will, I likely wouldn’t find anyone who thought free will meant that your own thoughts and desires could not influence your actions. Among family members and friends in a college ethics course, that was the result I found. I’ll assume that, Generally, people will hold that, at the very least, their thoughts control their actions, but people also typically hold that they have free will. If this is the case (it might not, I haven’t asked that many people or seen any surveys with this question) then I would posit that most people, consciously or not, subscribe to the compatabilist definition of free will. Either that, or most people are hypocrites unknowingly.

And, hey, maybe it’s the latter, and the world is full of hypocrites. But I don’t see the libertarian definition as particularly engaging, because the world it describes does not look like what I (and I assume most people) would describe as free will. I think that if most people took the libertarian definition of free will to its logical conclusion, they would realize that it is not the best definition of free will. But if you’ve already looked as it and decided that it fits your intuition of free will, then there’s not much I can do to change that except ask why."

"When? In 1971—Baltimore and Pittsburgh? We've had 8:00 starts regularly for almost 50 years.

It's the finishing times that have changed since then, sure, but my point is that this is not the worst thing to come of longer games. With the games stretched out—and more anemic offenses, with everything down except home runs, strikeouts, lengthy replay reviews, and commercial breaks—it's boring stuff for a lot of people. How many casual fans are excited at the prospect of a four-hour, nine-inning game, even if it does start at 7? (It's ending at 11 anyway! And once you get into extras...)"

She was so bad that eventually, like 50-70 students in the classes she taught went to the dean and she ended up getting put on forced leave.

So, if your professor is significantly impeding your ability to learn and pass a class, and it’s clearly affecting many people, then I’d go to the dean. Often times it’s because they’re genuinely assholes or just don’t care. "

Very fitting
"I would strongly suggest you attempt to learn about electricity. There are many different levels on which you can understand it. You basically need a level beyond that of your primary audience to appear mostly convincing. I would get a used Physics textbook that is one or two editions out of date for like $10 online. Skip to the section on electricity and magnetism. After that, I think it's important to try to learn the basics of electrical circuits. Understanding this stuff yourself is going to give you many more options creatively. With basic understandings of this stuff, you are going to be able to write something that is far more compelling. It will help you define the character's abilities and ways that those abilities can be creatively used. It will help you avoid missed opportunities. I'm sure you are aware that superhero fans get very up in arms when a character can do something and then randomly elects not to do that thing in a situation where it could have easily solved an otherwise terrible problem.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were you, I would make it so the character can create graphene within his/her body. Graphene is a up and coming super material made entirely of carbon (same thing we are mostly made of after water). Scientists and engineers are still trying to figure out how to make it cheaply enough that it can be used more widely. It's insanely useful and versatile. The properties of the graphene depend on the atomic level crystaline structure of it. By definition graphene is a sheet of carbon that is one carbon atom thin. If the character had layers within their skin that could turn into forms of graphene it could make for a very interesting character that could create all sorts of electrical components within their layers of skin. With this black box you can let super nerdy engineers figure out how your character did a particular thing. The one thing that you need to respect to do this is power (watts). Just say that they are the result of an AI that was allowed to genetically modify human DNA to create the next level of human evolution ;) They don't understand how they do it, but their body to do these things. If I were you, I would make sure the character understood electricity as little as possible. Make it so they've learned that they can do very specific things. This helps guard you against nerds who want to know why the character didn't do something within their abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as the physics [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law) tells us how much voltage is required to gap a certain distance. A 1 meter gap takes 3.4MV (3,400,000) through air -- 31,000 times wall power! (This is complicated stuff. I don't really understand it yet myself.) Luckily at that level it couldn't take much charge to do damage. Amperage is what kills/hurts people -- it's just that it requires a certain voltage to push the amperage deep into the body to stop the heart and very little current to do it. Power is just voltage times amperage. Energy is power times time. By controlling the AMOUNT of charge that your hero uses, it would affect if he stunned someone or not. For this reason, your hero would be much more effective the closer they were, and using power at a distance would require more and more effort on their part. Your hero could also have backstory where it took them a long time to be able to ""up"" the voltage high enough to do things like gapping across air. With this atomic level of control over carbon structures, you could allow them to produce an armor layer around their body that was stab/bullet resistant. The impact would still be felt like they were bludgeoned with a blunt object, but it could resist actually being puncture. So, internal damage would still happen to some effect with powerful guns or a close range.

&amp;#x200B;

With all this control, they could probably pick up on analogue signals and hear sound from them because analog electrical signals are waves and sound is air pressure waves. They could tune into AM/FM radio that wasn't digital (in the US I believe most/all FM is digital now, not sure about AM). Most electronics use digital signals, but when they interface with audio or movement, those signals are converted into analog signals, which your protagonist could manipulate. However, producing sound would be very different than hearing it or ""playing"" an analog signal they got from somewhere else. Producing like ""speaking"" in someone else's voice would require complex intelligence to synthesize those sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, after writing this obscenely long post in response to your question, and then deleting 80% of it, I would recommend going with graphene based ability (modern, trendy, blackbox of explanation) and keeping tract of energy (power \* time). Read up on how many watts are used by certain things. Remember that a watt is power PER second. So if their power source is a wall outlet that can handle 1800 watts (power) and they charge up for 5 seconds, they have 9000 watt \* seconds (9000 Joules). [wolframalpha.com](https://wolframalpha.com) is your friend. Type in ""1800 watts \* 14 seconds"" and it will tell you how much energy that is. You can have a little ledger of how much energy they have and how much they use. Google specific things to find out how much power it takes or energy. A light bulb takes a certain amount of **power** per second to light, but you can also say that lighting a light bulb for 10 seconds takes a certain amount of **energy**. Power is the **rate** at which you are using energy. **Energy** is the amount you have or have used. Think of it like a water tank. It might take 2 gallons per hour (**think power**) to drive at 60 mph in your car. If you drive for 4 hours you have used 8 gallons (**think energy**). So, it might take 3,400,000 volts to gap (the horsepower of your engine to get up a hill), but you only have to move a little bit of charge (you could think of each electron as an individual car). So, you maybe only move 10 miliamps (nearly deadly). Type this into [wolframalpha.com](https://wolframalpha.com) if you'd like to see how it works, ""3.4 megavolts \* 10m miliamps"", which is 34,000 watts. That means it takes 34,000 watts per second to send electricity 1 meter. To figure out how much energy it takes to do this for half a second , type ""34000 watts \* 0.5 seconds"" and you get 17,000 joules. Now type ""17,000 (watt \* seconds) / 1800 watts"" and you get 9.44 seconds -- this is the amount of time they would have to charge themselves through a standard outlet to be able to send electricity 1 meter for half a second. To calculate the amount of voltage needed use [https://www.vcalc.com/wiki/EmilyB/Paschen%27s+Law](https://www.vcalc.com/wiki/EmilyB/Paschen%27s+Law). Under pressure, select the units and change them to (atm). This is pressure measured in units of normal outdoor pressure -- 1 atm is normal room pressure. (Be an overachieved and calculate it based on temperature and altitude: [https://www.mide.com/pages/air-pressure-at-altitude-calculator](https://www.mide.com/pages/air-pressure-at-altitude-calculator)). Set the ""Secondary electron"" thing to 1 (it is often 1, and changing it with the range of values it could be has VERY LITTLE affect on voltage required). Then select the distance you want to find the required voltage for. Bam. You are now more realistic than you could have ever expected to be.

&amp;#x200B;

When ever you need to calculate something, just google the thing and put ""calculator"" at the end. This is how many engineering students get past homework when they have no clue what they are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

I recommend reading ""Introduction to Electronics"" by Earl Gates. It's a ECE 101 textbook for the first term of collect for students who think they want to be an electrical or mechanical engineer. It requires knowing Algebra, and that's about it. Some people in my class googled it; I bought it used for like $7. You only really need the first few weeks worth. Chapters 1 through 11. I would recommend chapers 12 through 18, and 27 as well. That's less than half the book, and almost none of the complicated stuff. It's designed to be an intro crash course in how electricity works.

&amp;#x200B;

"Favorite Expansion pack: Get Together, and Cats &amp; Dogs. I do not own Seasons yet, but that would probably replace Dogs &amp; Cats when I get it due to the amazing holiday calender system, and having changing weather as well.

Why: I like the clubs system, themed club parties, and focus on getting outside of the home in Get Together. Pets have always been a big part of my life, and even though we only get dogs, cats, and a few very minimally interactive small pets, I always want them to be an option in the game. It just makes everything feel more real, in a good way, to me.

"I can see what they were going for, but yeah, I don't think it worked that well. That being said, he was very minor character used for a very specific role, so it's not that big of a deal. What I'm a bit disappointed about is that they didn't do more with Claire Mahoney, who was similar, but much more developed character with a lot of potential, but she just vanished never to be seen again, like a few other characters from season 4. I guess with limited number of episodes in the final season there was just no way/point to try to bring every relevant character back."

"It's tough deciding on what to do for the rest of your life when you really haven't even lived.  If you were my kid, this is what I would tell you.

1.  Take some classes at a local junior college.  Declare any major, general studies, or just take classes that float your boat.  This will give you time to experiment and try things at a much cheaper price than at a 4 year institution.

2.  Join the military.  If you have had an interest in the military, when your young is the time.  If you don't like it, just do your 4 years and go back to school with a bunch of money to pay for it.  You'd still be pretty young by the time you did 4 years in the military and 4 years of college.

3.  Find a job.  Put yourself out there and try to find a job, any job.  Pick a company that might sound kind of cool to you.  Bonus if the company has a tuition assistance/reimbursement program.  Put some time in the company if you like and try a few different jobs.  If they will pay for school and you like it there, bonus!

As he told me, rats are smart and know not to spend time in dangerous settings. Only one trap was tripped, but it did not catch anything. The exterminator told me that the rat would not likely come back because the trap sent the message not to come back. I never saw a trace of the rat again."

Being polite or using the name YOU PICKED to be displayed to the world as who you are represented as in this environment... and turning that around as a con on the person who is just trying to start a conversation with another human is asinine. 

If you don't want someone to use your name of username THEN DONT DISPLAY IT.  

Use someone's name, be polite and a decent human. If they decide to not talk to you because you simply used their name, then you dodged a real bullet there. Why would you ever care to know anything about someone who gets upset by using their name.

However, the followers must be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.

&gt; [represion001](http://cosecharoja.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/represion001.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt; Mientras adentro del Congreso comenzaba la sesión para debatir el Presupuesto 2019, afuera la Policía salió de cacería.
&gt; 
&gt; Hubo represión con balas de goma, gas pimienta y palos. Entre los casi 30 detenidxs confirmados por Correpi hay trabajadores de La Garganta Poderosa y Télam, entre otros medios de comunicación.
&gt; 
&gt; En las redes se viralizaron videos del momento de las detenciones. El que está tirado en el piso, con la rodilla de un policía sobre la espalda, inmovilizado, es Francisco Pandolfi, el Rifle, periodista e integrante de La Poderosa.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; El que está en el piso es Francisco Pandolfi, el Rifle, compañero de [@gargantapodero](https://twitter.com/gargantapodero?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Con él trabajamos a diario coberturas sobre violencia institucional. En un vídeo de Crónica se ve cómo un policía le planta el caño al lado. Esto es lo que está pasando en [\#Congreso](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Congreso?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) &lt;https://twitter.com/cosecharoja/status/1055194744501035009/video/1&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; -Ahí está Nacho Levy, referente de la Poderosa, dice.
&gt; 
&gt; Las manos detrás de la espalda. La mano del oficial sobre el cuello. La cara pegada al piso.
&gt; 
&gt; -¿Cómo te llamas? Pregunta el que filma y recién ahí El Rifle grita su nombre.
&gt; 
&gt; No es raro el gesto en él. Nunca es el protagonista. A Francisco lo conocemos hace años. Estudió en DeporTea donde ahora da clases. Fundó con otrxs pibes Nos Digital. Trabajó en la redacción de Tiempo Argentino. Es parte de La Garganta Poderosa desde que salió el proyecto del barrio Zabaleta. Es nuestro contacto con la organización.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; La Policía de la Ciudad le planta una barreta a uno de los compañeros de La Poderosa detenidos, y las cámaras reproducen la mentira. &lt;https://twitter.com/gargantapodero/status/1055184211747987457/video/1&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; En un video de Crónica se ve claro. Mientras un policía lo mantiene a Francisco inmovilizado, otro se acerca con un caño y se lo pone justo al lado.
&gt; 
&gt; Este año armamos la cobertura sobre el juicio contra seis prefectos que torturaron a dos pibes de la organización, Iván y Ezequiel. Los detuvieron ilegalmente y llevaron a orillas del Riachuelo. Ahí los desnudaron, les pegaron y simularon fusilamientos. El caso iba a quedar impone. ¿A cuántos pibes torturan a diario en los barrios?
&gt; 
&gt; La Poderosa impulsó una causa que llegó a juicio oral. El día que condenaron a los prefectos, vecinxs y pibxs festejaron frente a Tribunales. Francisco estaba ahí. A un costado. Sonriendo. Fuera del foco de la cámara.
&gt; 
&gt; Esa noche hablamos con él. “Muchas gracias por el abrazo. Por el aliento”, contestó. ¿Francisco con un caño? No, esto tampoco va a quedar impune.

"Sponsored by Head and Shoulders. Problem is proposed and researched by Head and Shoulders. Answer is Head and Shoulders. They don't even say what about their shampoo is effective.

Ad.

Edit: ok I'll be productive. [Here's an old ad for Listerine claiming mostly the same thing.] (http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jKQXA9ZSwac/U-GL7jcGPBI/AAAAAAAAFsQ/HI3AMdbm-l8/s1600/listerine+ad+1926.jpg)

Listerine had an ad campaign where they researched bad breath and concluded it was a disease called halitosis. I think it's safe to assume they did the same with this dandruff ad but I want to use the halitosis example since I know more about it. Halitosis was revealed as something discovered using unbiased research, but was a problem proposed and researched by Listerine and solved by using Listerine. Neither Listerine or Head and Shoulders gave a solution that doesn't involve buying their product. Both examples start from an area of truth (bacteria causing bad breath or dandruff), but I say they're ads, because the answer is to buy their own product of undisclosed makeup.

So if this campaign was going today and Listerine did a paid sponsorship where a person goes to a Listerine lab to talk about how bad breath is caused by a disease called halitosis, and showed Listerine killing the bacteria, and said the answer to bad breath is to use Listerine, would that be an informative video, or an ad?"

Right, this and other comments on this thread may have answered my question:  it seemed clear to me that an unplanned shock would be pretty disastrous, but if you think that a calmer exit is impossible (and of course see the EU as a massive danger to the future of Britain), then the ""Flight 93"" approach makes more sense (to borrow a phrase from Trump's election)."

Italy, Bulgaria, Greece, Iceland, Maldives ... all had referendums asking **only** about the continuation of monarchy. All declined.

But this is just an example, I dont want to debate here about the republic. The problem is that we were asked too many questions at once, so people never had a chance to create a real *consensus*.

So these ""rules of democracy"" that you refer to,were never negotiated by society as a whole. And.. what a surprise some people dont like them!"

"Well you have to get into said college before you gain that college credit. We had much different college experiences.

Obviously but rent is typically higher than a mortgage (especially where I am in New England) so are they also not saving any money?

"[There’s also this little cultural thing](http://chsabina.tumblr.com/post/149648631235/stereotype-much) 

Yeah, it’s an opinion someone wrote but I pretty much get where they’re coming from. Their relationship was pretty much confirmed for me. People are expecting some big confession from Gray when he’s literally just not that kind of guy and we all know this. His actions speak a lot louder than words and it’s always been like that with him... in my opinion it should be obvious and Mashima threw that last tsundere moment in there just to appease the people who still don’t think their relationship is real. But the people who still think that are also the ones who expect a big confession from Gray when truly his character is not that type and we’re not gonna get it. They lived together, he was willing to die twice for her, they committed suicide together (which culturally means a lot), they worked and trained together, their magic was super compatible, he protected her as much as he could in battle, and he made the distinction of her being more than a comrade to him as she was dying. All this was clear. For someone who is in a relationship with a man who doesn’t show many emotions, this relationship in my humble opinion is most definitely canon. 

Edit: The same thing of not having a big confession goes for Natsu and Lucy. Natsu isn’t the type of guy for a huge confession either. Both characters show what they feel for Juvia and Lucy through their actions, not their words. We need to take it in context of the characters and who they are, part of Gajeel’s character development is that he became a lot less closed off and more sincere, plus Levy is the kind of girl who expects that confession, she gives a lot of importance to words, thats what her magic is all about, which is why the moment warranted it and Gajeel knew it. Neither Juvia nor Lucy need that type of confirmation, and neither Gray nor Natsu are the type to outright give it. Although it’s obvious Lucy got a bit upset in the last episode when Natsu didn’t share in her sentimentality in the way she expected him to. "

Hell, there are times *I've* engaged in ""duty sex"", not to mention non-bedroom instances of doing things that made my partners happy, that I personally didn't really feel like doing (does anyone out there actually like eating dinner with their in-laws?) I do believe that sometimes you have to grease the wheels of your relationship, so to speak, even if it runs counter to what you'd rather be doing. 

I suppose for me, the baseline would be whether the partner at least seems *comfortable* with what's going on. Some of the descriptions I've seen here read as if the LL partner is *very uncomfortable* during sex. If you're in ""this person is clearly forcing themselves"" territory, it's time for a step back, IMO. "

"From an outsider's perspective, it seems like your direct comparison of each of your family members visits and the amount of time you spent with them vs his time spent with your sister aren't quite the same situations.

You, an extrovert, who works from home (not an ideal extroverted situation) spent lots of time with his family members who you also said were helpful and pleasant. 

This, you are comparing to your sister visiting. Your partner is an introvert, working at a job (most likely around people all day, not an ideal situation for an introvert either) who then comes home to a house with your sister who sounds, for arguments sake, less pleasant of a house guest than his family. He comes home to a house with both of you girls and wishes to do what introverts do best, be in a quiet, possibly empty, place. (his/your room)

You spending time with his family would have been energizing and pleasant (most of the time) for you, while him coming home, doesn't seem to have that recharge time since he's on the other end of the extrovert/introvert spectrum. So when he gets home, he's spent from being around people, i'm assuming, all day, while you were being charged by being around people.

&amp;#x200B;

After all of that though, he probably should make more of an effort, i just wanted to bring those facts/opinions about your different situations so you didn't feel like he was being TOO selfish.

Maybe you could request his participation in specific situations after explaining that you're going to ask him to play/talk/interact at different times for the last week of her being here, and that you understand that you're in different situations, and he has different social needs than you. Try talking to him from a place of understanding, and maybe explain a short version of what you posted above to put it all in perspective for him.

Best of luck!"

"“Are you sure that is wise? If he attacked you, as you say, and you were simply defending yourself...” Telvae sighed, stabbing the hilt of her spear into the dry sands below. “...Then simply being here would put you in danger, and I fear he may attack me on sight. This is an issue, of course... Being that he has possession of something I need, and I may have to heal him to see it safely delivered.”


She pursed her lips, scanning across the corsairs arrayed before her. “Could you tell me *why* he attacked you, at least? What exactly happened? If I am to meet with him, it would benefit me to know how and why he fights. For my own safety.”

I think that if it were me, I would do the lowest contribution. If I knew that the pension would get the same returns as a Roth IRA then I might max that out. But even if you were getting a match on a 15% contribution into the pension, I get the impression that many of them are ran so conservatively that you very well may still end up ahead with a Roth IRA over that matched 15% pension. I also wouldn't even count the pension toward your 15%. Max out the Roth and use a traditional IRA for the rest. Remember the retirees of Hostess.

"What's funny is I've always considered myself a far better pitcher than hitter. I've thrown a perfect game against the CPU at 79 ego and regularly shut out human opponents, so I wouldn't really say I suck. After the update things have definitely changed. It seems like any pitch that's within the zone has a much greater chance of being barreled up, whether it's a mistake pitch or not. I've also noticed a sharp increase in bloop hits since the update. All these things, combined with the apparent reduction in the accuracy and power of pitchers, really make it harder for the defending team."

"What this person is missing here is that, for a lot of people, gender is a synonym with sex.  Quite a lot of people don't define gender to be personality, or any other trait besides your genitals and/or chromosomes.  If that was the case then they would have a point; but many of the people that don't believe in individuals being able to change their gender at will, do so because they don't think it is anything more than what you're born as.   
    
Obviously some exceptions to the norm occur when children are born with both male and female genitals, genetic boys have their y chromosome inactive so they develop like girls, or defects like Klein felters, etc.  But the legal definition the US government is seeking is designed to take that into account, and eliminate possibilities of being gender-fluid, because (again) many people don't consider gender to be a personality, only what you were biologically born as.    
   
The essence of this persons argument is that there exists a ""societal sex"", which is not necessarily the same as biological sex.  This is **not true for most individuals**.  While I support the freedom of people to choose to have a societal sex (whatever that means. People who support this idea don't actually have a consensus as to what defines a societal sex, and the poster this post links largely glosses over that, as they ask the question but don't answer it) that may or may not line up with who they are biologically.  But quite a lot of people don't see others in the light of having a gender and a sex characteristic, because to them there is no difference in the **definition** of the two.   
   
Put simply, some people don't see a ""societal gender"".  Which means that, to them, this whole gender debate is pointless.  They might be sexist and believe that your sex means you can't/shouldn't have a certain personality; or they might not be, and say you can choose to have any personality regardless of what sex you were born into.  But the point remains that the whole idea of socially transgender people **depends** on the ideology of there existing a ""social sex"", which many people don't accept.   
    
EDIT: grammer and I restructured it to (hopefully) be easier to read.

But LEGO games in general for all systems, one game I would love to see a sequel for would be Legoland 2 -  really loved the first one

A second could build up (no pun intended) on the previous game and add a lot of new themed attractions from new lines/series that have been made since then over the years - and nice throwbacks to older ones too

But on that note, although I don’t mind franchises getting games, but it would be nice if we could get more original LEGO styled games again in the vein of those like Creator,Sports,Chess,Racers, etc. (and whatever other lines I can’t remember off the top of my head)

Also it would be nice if we could expand on series that were in LEGO Dimensions to get standalone games (Adventure Time,Sonic,Portal,Doctor Who, etc...) a lot of those series would work pretty well translated into full games, I think..."

Animals are just less complex and they still do annoying things and you have to pick up after them for as long as they live and you get no payoff apart from the fact that it likes you because you give it food and affection.

You don't even know how balistic missiles work and how MIRV works.

So let me explain it to you like 5.

1. MIRV after launching LEAVES proper atmosphere
2. In upper atmosphere it reaches 20 000 km/h or more
3. It travels in less than 30 minutes to any point on planet
4. When it reaches destination it reenters proper atmosphere
5. Then it splits into several to many nukes depending on MIRV model.
6. Each of those nukes target single city and single MIRV can cover most of larger cities in medium size country like France
7. None of those nukes or MIRV itself can be intercepted, they are simply to fast for any tracking system
8. Many such MIRVs will be used in attack.

This is what MAD is and why it works. If you shoot missiles then i shot mine and both of us will go to hell.

Full salvo of MIRVS is enough to completely make go back country of size of US to stone age.

And we were 2 times very close to such situation:

1. Cuban crisis
2. When Russians detected US attacking them one guy halted MAD because he didn't believe system."

"Ditto, fellow INTP (from your comment above). I'm only 2+ years on this path, but my path to Jung was so crazy, magical (after the fact), and mysterious (at the time). It's like my unconscious was grasping at things I'd need for later, to recognize them when I later discovered that Jung was pulling them all together. My rational, scientifically trained mind was suddenly pulled to yoga, mythology, archetypes, hermeticism, alchemy, the occult, hinduism, the conscious and unconscious, buddhism, the bible, dream journaling, lucid dreaming. 

Once I found Jung it all clicked. Now I am devouring his words and seeing a Jungian analyst who has helped me to uncover previously hidden-to-myself truths.  

It's like my unconscious led me right where I needed to be, ""**You will listen to me** (the unconscious) **this time**!"" Meanwhile my consciousness was tricked as to the reason I'd decided to see a Jungian analyst, ""Oh, you're seeing this therapist because you're so into Jung, you can talk about his theories with her!"" (As if it was just an intellectual curiosity.) When in reality my unconscious was like, ""There's some stuff here you need to address, and you're gonna need help to see it. I'm going to go get us that help.""

Crazy but beautiful stuff. My unconscious is my friend, even though I still run from it in my dreams lol."

Tbh, you're the type of religious zealot that makes the rest of us look bad. Mental illness exists, it always has. However, we have modern science that can help rather than force ""just believe and it will go away"" doctrine down people's throats. I believe in god, yet I suffer from major depression and have since I was a child. No amount of prayer will make my depression go away, nor my neurological disability.

Hate to burst your bubble Susan, but what you're doing is turning people AWAY from god. Why? People put their whole being in to prayer to no resolve, and lose faith. Mental illness is physical, it causes physical, measurable changes in your brain AND body. It's not just ""oh no, I'm sad."" Some people actually NEED medication BECAUSE of the physical changes in their body. Sometimes faith helps people, sometimes it doesn't. But preaching that faith is the cure is incorrect and spits in the face to people who have either tried religion and failed, or to those that are still religious and struggle. You're putting the blame on the sufferer and telling them ""well you didn't try hard enough."" You think anyone wants to be depressed? Anyone likes it? No, mental illness is no one's fault, and you're not any less of a person if religion isn't your answer.

- Sincerely, a person of god who understands what actual mental illness is like."

"I don't agree with that assessment at all. So you'd rather have Josh McCown at the vet minimum than Russell Wilson at fair market value? And that's the ""only way to win in the NFL?"" Nonsense. Acquiring an elite player and paying him exactly what he's worth is *far* better than ""neutral,"" and acquiring a subpar player doesn't ""pay off"" in terms of helping you win even if he's dirt cheap.

The two best free agent signings the Cowboys ever made were Deion Sanders and LaRoi Glover. Both cost a lot of money, but they were elite talents. They helped us win far more games than if we'd gotten bargain basement knock-offs instead. By your logic, those were both ""neutral""? Nobody who watched those teams would agree.

Moreover, you're ignoring the expected probability of any of these outcomes occurring. Drafting an elite WR in the first round might be possible, but it's really hard to do -- only 40% will even achieve an 800-yard season within their first 3 years. Meanwhile, we already know for certain that Cooper isn't an absolute NFL bust on the level of Charles Rogers or Breshad Perriman, whereas lots of first round draft prospect are. 

&gt; So we made a trade with a small upside but big risk. A draft pick has a small downside but a very big upside.

I disagree. The upside is roughly the same in each case (acquiring an elite player). The draft pick has some additional financial benefits, but at the cost of it being far less likely that you'll actually achieve the upside.

The risk is also roughly the same in each case (wasting a first round pick and missing out on a better player you could have had), except that if Cooper's a bust he can be cut with no dead money, whereas the draft pick can't. And again, the probability of a given first round pick being a complete bust is far, far, higher than the probability of someone who's already made multiple Pro Bowls being a complete bust. "

I don't think they're done with RPGs. I'm fully expecting there's still a dark fantasy action RPG in the works that may be Bloodborne 2 or a new IP. In my mind it would make a lot of sense for Sony to commission BB2 for a PS5 launch but that's just a guess.

I don’t see any scenario where Bell is franchised again next season. Most likely he gets a transition tag, but he’ll still end up with a long term deal somewhere. "

 I'm not saying I sit down in the bed and immediately start demanding but if I'm there forever yeah they can feed me, I'm always nice but I will ask,  same goes for blankets, meds ,drinks...its not like I can get them myself,  In my experience your attitude determines how you will be treated.

 Like I said I've been In the hospital a lot this year and especially after I'm admitted I always am friendly with the nurses and more importantly with the techs because they are the ones that really can hook you up; extra blankets, extra pillows, stop by on their way out with magazines,etc.

I hate being in the hospital but except in very isolated instances my care has been superb,  I'll be in a room with a person who has the same nurses and techs as me and they will complain and tell their friends or visitors how horrible the caregivers are meanwhile I'm sitting next to them in my bed eating chocolate covered strawberries the nurse brought me lol.  And it has nothing to do with money I'm on Medicaid.  All about your attitude.  Even when I was literally coming off of life support, scared and in pain, I didn't bark at the nurse,

"Yup. When I went to college my social anxiety was so bad I could barely make eye contact. Started seeing a great therapist and luckily college afforded me a lot of opportunities that arose naturally to work on social skills. A year later I was quite gregarious and had become a student leader in a variety of ECs/campus positions. If you're looking to make that change later in adulthood it may be harder, in the sense that you will have to seek out opportunities to develop your social skills (instead of them falling in your lap like in college), but if you can do that it'll help a lot. Meetups, professional networking events, striking up conversations with strangers, etc would all be beneficial."

It'll send you text messages saying, ""it's super busy"" three towns over and tell you to go there and dash while you have 4 stacked orders.

It might be a bit difficult now seeing as the season is over, but I would suggest watching a few games to get an idea of the teams and maybe you'll get attached to a team.

Personally I reckon North Melbourne would be a good team for you to follow based on what you have described. They're a mid table team, always there and there about for the finals, and aren't too flashy like the Ravens."

Creo que es lo más triste que ví en el día.

"I think people skip disusing probabilities when its convenient for them and jump straight to the assumption that most likely of the probability is somehow already proven. 

Probabilities is the step law enforcement is acting on looking at capability &amp; various motive's. A discussion about what are all the motives, what percentage of the population is even capable is a normal conversation that should occur and its sort of centrist which just gets you attacked by both sides. In your example you would get just as much heat as someone who says Muslims did it if you say of the population that may of committed the attack X% or a large group Muslim extremists and its less likely others did it based on motive leaving a really low probability other members of the population did it. 

What I think is missing is unlike Europe where the probability kinda makes a safe bet next time a bomb goes off. The probability of a political extremist on the right ignoring the politics surrounding the midterm while doing a methodical attack that skews smarter individuals building bomb and time to reason though the repercussions that will hurt their own causes still exists but is much much smaller then anyone who is sure will admit. I don't discount that its still a probability.

I was big argument over  the black church that was burned down right before the 2016 vote that was also spray painted with ""vote trump"" on pretty much the same grounds. The crime of arson skews towards local arsonists, and it takes a real special person in the population to think ""vote Trump"" in that context would help. It wasn't a surprise to me that the arson was a regular member of their church and not a Trump supporter. "

"There is always, always, *always* a strong negative correlation between religiosity and the metrics we usually use to measure societal health. 


The less religious a society is, the better it tends to score on metrics such as income equality, social equity, literacy rates, crime rates - especially violent crime - education, healthcare....Far from there being no evidence that religion is required for or encourages moral behavior, there is *direct evidence* to the contrary.


Meanwhile, there are growing numbers of people who are leaving religion in traditionally very religious countries (e.g. the USA) and yet we are *not* seeing a commensurate increase in crime rates there as these hordes of newly irreligious people start pillaging, murdering and raping everyone.



I honestly don't know why this is still a topic for discussion. The fact that neither societies nor individuals become ""morally corrupt"" as they abandon religion is demonstrable."

Tbh, you're the type of religious zealot that makes the rest of us look bad. Mental illness exists, it always has. However, we have modern science that can help rather than force ""just believe and it will go away"" doctrine down people's throats. I believe in god, yet I suffer from major depression and have since I was a child. No amount of prayer will make my depression go away, nor my neurological disability.

Hate to burst your bubble Susan, but what you're doing is turning people AWAY from god. Why? People put their whole being in to prayer to no resolve, and lose faith. Mental illness is physical, it causes physical, measurable changes in your brain AND body. It's not just ""oh no, I'm sad."" Some people actually NEED medication BECAUSE of the physical changes in their body. Sometimes faith helps people, sometimes it doesn't. But preaching that faith is the cure is incorrect and spits in the face to people who have either tried religion and failed, or to those that are still religious and struggle. You're putting the blame on the sufferer and telling them ""well you didn't try hard enough."" You think anyone wants to be depressed? Anyone likes it? No, mental illness is no one's fault, and you're not any less of a person if religion isn't your answer.

- Sincerely, a person of god who understands what actual mental illness is like."

"Renly's hands trembled as he wrote his reply. He knew that his father had been distracted by his duties and the war, that he should have taken up the reins to make this match work. And yet he had not. *Women, how does any man understand them? How can any man keep their company?*

He resolved to have one last say, for such things do not die well in silence.

&gt; My Lady,

&gt; I admit that your letter has taken me by surprise, even if its message does not. You are right, of course. I have neglected you, even betrayed you. It is not easy for any man to admit his own failure in matters of honor or matters of the heart. I am no dashing knight, that is true. I have few honors to my name, and I do not expect that they ought to sway your heart. I hope that your generosity, my lady, is greater than my failure. Come to King's Landing and meet me, spend but an hour to know me and settle that which weighs upon your heart. Our match is the product of our fathers' friendship, it is the least we can do for them. If you should curse my name let it be cursed, but let me hear it from your own lips rather than your quill. I hope your father's health remains with him, I know it would lift my father's spirit greatly to see him as well. 

&gt; Your servant, 

&gt; Renly"

"&gt;Ive tried the workouts app and it is ok, I like how it will play my music while running. But the data management is horrible, there is no place to really see past data without looking at each run individually. The health app shows the total time but not distance or anything else so its not real good.

I don't disagree that Apple's workouts leaves a lot to be desired, but I don't understand this comment completely.  If you open the ""Activities"" app on the iPhone, all of your runs are listed below as workouts and they all list total distance.  Maybe you are specifically talking about exporting distance out of the health app data?  I just wanted to make sure you're aware of the workouts in the ""Activities"" app, that's all.  


I've tried a half dozen running apps, but all of that was before I got the Apple Watch.  My needs are extremely basic as I just want to know current pace, average pace, heart rate, and distance and the stock app does that for me easily.  But I'm not trying to do anything with the data or share it with anyone outside of the shared activities."

\-Warkite Marauder helps get through Doom Whisperer or aurelia and that's about it, so while that is nice I think there are better game plans, like countering them even if it means letting them land something smaller.

"Pasta from comment I made elsewhere

So I just woke up and saw this. In my emerging terrorism threats course , I did a presentation on domestic terrorism. My professor was profoundly offended that I focused on white supremacists as they are responsible for nearly all acts and attempted acts of domestic terrorism. He wanted me to focus on homegrown violent extremists, which according to him are domestic terrorists who are inspired by acts abroad, which was his thin excuse for telling us domestic terrorists are Islamic jihadists. I got a 50 because I refused to focus on his frankly racist belief. I feel vindicated and dismayed.

The idiots making policy are stuck in this circular trap believing that Islamic individuals are the ones committing acts of domestic terrorism. The truth is, hundreds or thousands died from KKK freedom rides, in which they'd hunt down black people, tar and feather them, hang them, or wait and hang them in front of *the entire town* as a form of *entertainment*. 

They did this from the end of the Civil War til the end of the Civil rights era. So, a good century of white domestic terrorism. Including attempted acts, the far right has performed about 120 acts of domestic terrorism from 2008 to 2016, with about 60 acts from Islamic Americans/legal residents. 

So our policy makers keep focusing on the minority, while the majority is the bigger problem. We need to face the fact that Conservativism has proven to be fertile ground for domestic terrorism for over a century. Trump has pushed suggestions of violence against the press, liberal politicians and civilians, and admired dictators for their ability to use state sponsored violence to enact policy.

This could be the Reichstag fire I've been fearing. Whether or not Trump is involved beyond inspiring domestic terrorism, I have no doubt he'd like to use this to both mock the recipients of the bombs and claim it shows liberals are hated by the good citizens though isn't it unfortunate people are forced to mail bombs as political protest against unpopular liberal ideas.

Vote. The alt-right is making attempts at assassination now. "

"&gt;They keep threatening to have me committed to a mental institution.

this is much more speculative than anything, but i would say another solid reason to contact cps about this would be to do what you can to prevent your parents from acting on these threats. while outright institutionalization isnt very common for minors, its not at all uncommon for parents to send their children to ""therapeutic boarding schools"" or other programs with similarly sugar coated names. ive personally witnessed dozens of cases where perfectly normal children were placed in these programs as a result of one or both of their parents' dysfunctions. if you are healthy both mentally and physically, and not engaging in self destructive behaviors, one of these programs would be absolutely unfit for you and would provide you no benefits leading into your adult life.

these threats are manipulative scare tactics, and constitute emotional abuse. threatening your child with institutionalization _is not normal_."

"Hi, /u/sadfishbird,

Unfortunately, we have had to remove [your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9r2g1x/-/) in /r/worldbuilding because it violated one of our rules. In particular:

Images and maps must include worldbuilding-relevant context *on the reddit post* (as a comment, in the text of the post or, in some cases, in the posted image itself—e.g. infographics). This is important to establish that your post is on-topic and to help encourage productive discussion.

* A post has enough context when a person unfamiliar with your world could understand what you're talking about and ask informed questions about it. This could include a summary of your world, explanation about what your post depicts and how it fits in your world, etc. (""What's a [proper noun]?"" usually doesn't qualify.)
* For maps, you could discuss economic and political situations, the different cultures, or anything else that gives the reader a wider view of your world than just its geography.
* Discussion of the artistic process or techniques used to create the map or image may be included, but does not count as “worldbuilding-relevant” on its own. Infographics that self-contain sufficient context to be understood do not require additional context.

More info in our rules: [2. All posts should include original, worldbuilding-related context.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/wiki/rules#wiki_2._all_posts_should_include_original.2C_worldbuilding-related_context.)

"Yeah, you're right. Women hate money. My bad.

The truth is people like you are exactly the problem. (Not what anyone on Reddit wants to hear, I know.) No, not overtly, though I don't know you so maybe. But here you are saying, ""Women don't want those jobs."" All their lives, women are hearing ""that's for boys"", ""girls don't want that."" (Yes it goes both ways, but I'm talking about the trades specifically.) And that creates an image of what femininty is. So just to start with, to get into these fields women have to overcome this feeling in themselves. 

But then they have to overcome these feelings in people like you, who think women don't want these jobs and if they're there, it's only because programs help her get there. 

Do you think the people that started these programs are the people who a woman works with day to day? They're not. She works with people who think like you. She works with people who think she got her job because of her gender and these programs. (not all the people, but enough people.) So she has to be not only as good as the average guy, but better. Not only is she often representing her gender, she knows that if she's just average, the men around her will think she took the job from other men. 

And then there's the overt sexism, and the benevolent sexism.

"When catgirls inevitably become real, it's not going to be some brand new species. It's going to be a human with cat features on it. The easiest way to make a catgirl is to take an existing girl and put cat ears and a tail on her using regenerative medicine. Thus, they are intellectually identical to the rest of us, meaning that they deserve the same rights. 

Even from a relationship standpoint, I'd never want to own a catgirl. I want a catgirl that stays with me because she loves me, not because of some fucked up slavery. I want a happy catgirl wife, not a slave. If anything, I'd prefer to be the pet in the relationship, but that's just my desire for belly rubs talking.

Be 17.
Be turning 18 soon.
Ask parents for Shrek themed party.
Just like the last 12 years.
Mom says I'm too old for Shrek
Tell her she better check herself before she Shrek's herself
Mom asks if I've taken my meds.
I say yes, then ask for an onion flavored cake.
Mom says no.
I call her a Farquaad bitch.
She sends me to my room and tears stream down my face.
Jacking off will probably cheer me up.
Pull out super dreck MLP Friendship is Magic DVD collection
Open them up to see five Shrek discs (including Puss in Boots) that my mom thought were in her room.
Its the 171st day of the year.
Today I am scheduled to masturbate to Artie from Shrek the Third.
Fap furiously when Artie appears and am finished in seconds.
Wipe semen off my chest with Twilight Sparkle stuffed pony.
Start to think about fight with mother again.
Get an idea.
Sneak out of room.
Mom is sleeping.
Go to shed in backyard
Grab the sharpest tool in the shed.
Stand outside Mom's door.
Too chicken to do it. I pray to Shrek for courage.
The scent of onions fill the room.
A green hand takes the tool from me.
""I'll take it from here laddie."" Shrek says.
Shrek plants the tool deep in my mother's body ogre and ogre again.
The stabbing went on for almost an hour.
Blood sprayed all ogre the room and on my body. Especially my hands and arms.
Shrek is finally finished with my mother and he looks at me.
I pull off my blood soaked clothes and poke my butt in the air.
Shrek picks me up with one hand and uses his Schlong to sweep the remains of my mother off of her bed.
Despite the carnage, it still smells like onions.
But now the smell of waffles and litter enter the room as well.
Donkey, Fiona and Puss are suddenly at my side.
All of them are just as nude as Shrek.
Shrek flops down on his back on the bed.
Blood pools around him as his weight squeezes it out of the mattress like a sponge.
He still has me in one hand.
He skewers me on his shrock and begins using my asshole to pleasure himself.
His slimy member provides lube, but it does nothing to stop the anal stretching as it flexibly snakes its way through my intestinal tract.
Princess Fiona jumps on top of me and I silently plead to Shrek that my small dick is enough to please her majesty.
Fiona slips my dick into her snatch and it closes in around my penis.
Her ogress pussy vacuums my dick with the frenzy of a Jack in the Box customer trying to get just one little taste of his ogrely thick milkshake.
It feels as if the inside of my woody is being sucked out my pee hole.
I am now in the middle of an ogre sandwich. An Ogreo if you will.
I motorboat her giant green titties and suck the onion juice out of her nipples.
All the while with Shrek's green anaconda still slithering inside me.
I turn my head to the left and gasp for breath.
As I do, Donkey stuffs my mouth with his schlong.
It quickly finds its way deep into my esophagus.
I am finding hard to breath with Donkey's ""little Donkey"" thrusting within, yet never receding from my gaping mouth as one of my nostrils is filled with snot.
Puss in Boots nimbly climbs up the others and drags his ass and balls on my face.
Puss turns around and I see his small barbed baculum poking out from his fur.
He examines my two nose cunts and thankfully chooses the one already filled with snot to jab his boner into.
It is the greatest moment of my life.
I submit myself completely to Fairy Tale Lands finest.
The amount of movement going in on inside of me is indescribable.
I am now 33% cock.
I reach around and claw at Fiona's rump, trying to get a chance to stick my fist in the greatest woman of all time.
Then, it happened.
Shrek and Donkeys foreskin meet together in my tummy.
Their tips lightly kiss one another, right before spewing a stew of cum inflating my stomach like a water balloon.
Seconds later, I spunk into Fiona's pussy.
My eyes roll back in my head.
I am breathing furiously yet only through one nostril.
It isn't ogre yet.
I release a lengthy stream of semen as I never have before.
Donkey and Shrek still seem to be filling me with their love like a hose of sperm.
I am pumping an inhuman amount of jizz into Fiona, when I realize that it must be Shrek and Donkey whose cum is helping to give me extra virility.
Puss's saw like wang is finally running out of mucus to drill out of my nose and it begins shaving off my nose hairs.
My nose bleeds a thick pink blood-semen cocktail courtesy of Puss in Boots.
After about a minute, Shrek and Donkey's ogresm is complete.
Seconds later mine is done too.
I am more satisfied and exhausted than I have been in my entire life.
But it still isn't ogre.
I look deeply and lovingly into Fiona's green eyes as Puss and Donkey retreat from my orifices.
She spills forth from her mouth a cascade of all our juices.
It drenches my face and I squint to see Fiona, Donkey, and Puss all looking down on me with adoration.
Between gulps, I gargle ""Shrek is love. Shrek is life.""
I fall gently to sleep with Shrek's penis still moving inside of me and mine still inside Fiona.
I wake up the next morning in my mothers bed to the smell of onions and waffles.
I am alone except for the unrecognizable corpse on the floor.
Shrek and the others must have licked the cum all off because all that is left was blood and a floury substance on my hand.
I go to the kitchen to find a plate of onion waffles waiting for me.
Finally I have a family who cares for me.
After eating the feast my lovers left me, I went to my room to tell the other brogres online about my Shreksperience.
I find a note on the door.
""I was thinking about your party, and I decided that you can have a Far Far Away party after all. It is your big day and it is up to you to decide how to spend it. I will bake you your onion cake and make brownies for everyone else. Even though you have grown up into a wonderful Prince Charming, you will always be my special little boy. Love Mommy.""

"&gt; Wages are rising at a rapid pace

Actually doesn't your own source contradict you? **though they are, as of now, only keeping up with inflation...But even the latest increase only just offsets rising inflation, each having risen 2.9 percent in the past year.** Inflation is same rate as wage growth, which means nominally / ""real wage"" is flat. 

&gt; Steel workers getting a raise

Because of steel tariff, while other industries that BUY steel are running short.

&gt; Number of job openings at record highs

&gt; Citing Tax Reform, GE Appliances Launches $200M Investment in U.S. Manufacturing, Adding 400 Jobs

Individual companies making noise, but isn't total job growth lower and slower than under Obama? https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001?output_view=pct_12mths 

Also job openings is nearly flatlined from Obama era https://www.factcheck.org/2018/05/trump-spins-rise-in-job-openings/

So with employment capping out so soon after Obama and job openings larger than those looking, isn't this a REALLY bad time for Trump to be cutting back and fighting immigration? Including legal?

&gt; However, we just collected a record amount of income tax revenue.

A receipt increase of only 0.4% despite the trillion and a half deficit and the what 2.9% inflation rate? AND a deficit increase?

&gt; 15 employers that boosted benefits in wake of tax reform

&gt; These companies are paying bonuses with their tax savings

So with the job growth as false and the job openings flat and the real wages flat, all we have left from the trillions in tax cuts is company bonuses. How confident are you that these outpace what would have been the gov spending?"

I'm going to make one suggestion (that I make to everyone with Oculus Rift), and that is: Don't hang it from the backstrap. The ""skull plate"" or (whatever you want to call it) contains electronics for the ears, and the right earphone is fed from the left side, across the back. The flexing that can be induced this way can eventually break those connections and knock out one or both ears. Plus, this also bends the main cable 180 degrees where it passes through the holder on the left side, and this is a common point of failure too. "

"None of that disproves: ""Women love don't give a fuck attitudes right up until it's time to buy groceries.""

Women want a man to take care of them, like your husband does. But, and there is a lot of scientific data behind this - women also like the bad boy. For example, did you know that women are more attracted to criminals when they are ovulating? Did you know that women that cheat are actually more likely to get pregnant from the man they are cheating with?

These are fun little quirks of psychology. And, it's ok to admit what turns you on - even if you made the right choices.

The bottom line is this - the dude in this example was always a dead beat. So, why does he have 3 baby mommas? The answer is what I already put down."

"I understand where you're coming from, but if even if she is a registered/licensed nurse or from a care setting background, she is completely overstepping boundaries. 

The responsibility of this child's long term management lies with her clinician and their team.  She has absolutely no right to make changes without discussing it with the doctor overseeing her care, and with her parents. If she has concerns about a hypo developing, she should be contacting the parents at the time and discussing her suggestions with them. Closer monitoring is usually required during a transition period and might be more useful than taking it upon herself to change routines without permission or context.

She has a duty of care to that child, and her professional conduct is absolutely appalling in this matter.  It is part of her job to know her role and responsibilities and to be accountable for her actions. It doesn't make her a bad nurse but she has shown very poor judgement here, and I can think of several ways this can go wrong and end up in an emergency situation anyway. 

When your actions put a patient's health at risk because you have stepped outside of your professional and/or legal remit, good intentions don't matter. Just my opinion, from someone who works in a clinical setting. "

Not good enough for me honestly.

Being limited to the weapons you spawn with is not acceptable.

From the moment I spawn into my very first match I want to literally have every combination possible that the game can give me. With Quake Champions I literally have every single option. There's none of these exceptions that you've just had to lay all out in 4 paragraphs and try to argue that they don't matter because everything is balanced.

I don't have to play the game to tell you that it's not balanced. Why? Because no game is balanced. Dirty Bomb could be the best balanced game of all time, and it's still not good enough to gate off options."

"They could just not be in a rush or waiting for the new fiscal year, but hoping to string along people they've already interviewed in the hopes of not having to start the process over.  Hopefully they'll eventually {soon} give you an answer.  

Is 10 weeks normal in your field?  In mine it's rare to have more than one interview, and you usually get a response back of some sort shortly after.  I've had interviews where the company was upfront that their hiring process would take a while and if I received a job offer I liked in the meantime I should take it.  I've also had another interview where shortly after I was told they were looking for something else but they would let me know if things changed.  I don't know if it's normal in every field - I'm in a large enough city but the industry feels fairly small {lots of parties so everyone knows everyone} so it helps keep bridges intact.  

If they never respond, perhaps it's a good thing?  If they ghost you before you're hired, would they care about you if you work there?"

Re*eEE****eE***

&gt;Where's the mentioning of Bonecrusher tanking / incapping for example, which is great for noobs if they can't handle headtracing for superfast takedowns?

Ew.

For noobs looking for solid advice, there's nothing worse than telling said noob that the best way to play KF2 is to use the cheesiest tactic in the world. Sure, there's no harm in mentioning it, but most of the time people prop up the tactic on a pedestal like it's a prophet or phomephing. Ph.

Ph's aside, the reason why skilled players give the best way to play is because we're assuming that the player wants to become good at the game or the perk they are playing. If they don't, then there's no harm in simply ignoring us. There is harm, though, in telling a player who wants to learn the meta or learn how to get better to just cheese their way through, as they'll end up learning the hard way that people were *lying to them.*

&gt;Or deraging FPs with parries?

*I literally see people mentioning this in beginner tip threads all the time*

&gt;You don't ALWAYS have to be a topnotch DPS with a Berserker. There's a tank-side to it as well.

The tank-side is pretty easy to learn. Keep your Parry up, you can stab a Bloat with a Zwei - or Katana! - to induce melee hit and follow it up with a light attack to decap, etc. I will make one concession, and that is that learning how to recover from a failed takedown and, now, an enraged Scrake, isn't taught all that much (it's all a matter of inducing melee hit or stumble without getting hit yourself, thus allowing you to retry a takedown as it you've done a riposte). And it should, as you aren't gonna be accurate with your takedowns all the time.

&gt;If the Crovel is workable, and the Katana is very similar to Crovel... then why is Katana so totally garbage while the Crovel is fine and dandy? Because you can't kill Scrakes/FPs with it superquick? Well... then don't use it against Scrakes/FPs, perhaps?

Because the Crovel can do Katana's job *and* take out HVTs safely. Katana can only do the former. Nailgun is practically a necessity at this point, so there's no reason to say ""well then just run Katana + Crovel.""

&gt;Well... cuz we survive and I took all the enemy hits rather than my team?

Again, how do you know that you're the one who took ""all the enemy hits?"" Not meaning to sound pedantic, but it's incredibly difficult for players to tell if they're hampering their team or not.

&gt;(Static Strikers and nades to EMP big ones when there's precision allies, Bonecrusher tanking when there's firebug+demo allies or when I need to tank in general, Katana+Evis in a kiting team or when going solo etc)

EMP is not a great incap. It's not a bad one, but it's not a good one. EMP causes panic for EMtrash, and although some still follow you while flailing madly, others will just run off in a random direction. Only helpful when someone is inches away from death. As for HVTs, EMP is smart against enraged Scrakes, if you ever need to run after one to protect an ally. But you do have to watch, though, because people cannot bash stumble an EMP'd HVT.

Bone Crusher is still somewhat viable against precision perks. Especially since you have to understand that *precision perks have stumble power.* Just look at Support with the pure stumble power on the guns and skills.

Again, Katana+Evis isn't great for a loadout entirely based around killing. If you wanna kill things easily, I'd take either a Crovel + Nailgun or, for your sake, a Katana + Nailgun.

&gt;That's totally fine, as long as the noob tactics are also told (which they haven't, not in this thread at least). At least, it doesn't have to come off as so smug and superior.

Tell that to all the people on this subreddit who give subpar advice and act like it's the best advice.

Now, to not sound like a dickhead, imma preface this with the following: I don't wanna copy that giant mathematical response you made.

&gt;""that mathematical response you made""

*Aw, for fucks sa-*

Jokes aside, Rango uses a bash cancel bind, so his ROF numbers are probably different from the doc. I also use his bind, but I don't think it's necessary to do well with the Zwei in terms of trash clearing. Still more control than the Katana.

&gt;meleehit vs. stumble

Sorry, I had to do it again. I hope you don't mind.

Yes, Katana needs like 100 stumble on the heavy hit. That would make it as good as, if not better, than the Crovel. Better because, again, its stab could be used to pop a rioter head, IIRC.

Adding more melee hit wouldn't really accomplish anything, because once Katana receives 100 stumble on the heavy hit, it becomes similar to the Crovel in terms of use vs. HVTs, except you don't have to bash the Scrake with the Crovel (because Crovel doesn't grant a parry stumble to riposte from).

&gt;But I find with Massacre and using primary fire, it does a good enough job to flinchlock lesser enemies to not hurt me at all, if not just outright decapping most of them.

That is the case for every melee weapon. Kind of a moot point if you ask me. Except, I will concede, the Katana *may* grant extra incap power to Husks, but they resist melee hit a lot. Maybe EDARs.

&gt;I'm gonna go out on a limb here and ask a question; Have you guys actually used the Katana with primary fire lately? Not an antagonist question, just an honest curiosity.

Of course. I used to use it a lot when I was leveling and I thought it was cool. And it is cool. But now, using Smash, it grants me a bit more control over medium Zeds with the extra heavy and headshot damage.

&gt;I hope you mean ""I"" as in Tripwire, yes?

Yeah. Well, kinda; the community has also defended TWI's terrible decisions, such as upgrades, the Railgun, the M99, the Doomstick buff...

&gt;I think you maybe misunderstood me when I mentioned Winchester? What I was saying was that the *Tier 2 option*(Xbow in this case) is not necessarily a weapon you skip as you are going through a long game when trying to get higher tier gear, since the Xbow is so different from the starting gun.

I actually didn't see that you mentioned the Winchester. I kinda just thought of that gun when typing and how it related to my point that, in my opinion, tier shouldn't be too big of a concern when balancing, especially with the upgrade system in place.

&gt;Winchester vs Xbow is a rather heavily different loadout. Winchester is decent for smallfry and mediums, Xbow is better used for mediums and heavies (can be used for smalls by shooting at a downward angle for easy arrow pickups, but this is not particularly viable on higher difficulties), so they compliment each other.

Exactly. the Crossbow has a good *use*. Its use is that it can one-hit stun Scrakes with a stun build, and you can still run an M14 with it.

The Winchester has great upgrade scaling, making it worthwhile to upgrade if you plan on rocking an M14 alongside it.

&gt;Pump Shottie and DBS are similar in this regard as well.

Except the SG isn't viable. It's both pump action and tube fed, which isn't a great mix. Plus it scales poorly with upgrades.

The DBS used to be your best DPS + incap option for dealing with HVTs. But that's gone now since the Doomstick does the Boomstick better and allows you to carry an AA-12. But yes, I get your point; it's a good Tier 2 because it's useful.

Also, the MP5 is useful because you can actually kill a Fleshpound on HoE 6P with one mag with maybe a few bullets worth of a margin of error, something that not even the Kriss SMG can do."

"I have some doubts and I am struggling to strengthen my faith.

Jesus taught that forgiveness is by obedience and repentance.

Jesus did not teach the doctrine of the Original Sin

Jesus did not teach the sin inheritance

Jesus did not teach that all people are born sinners

In Mark 10:13-16, Matthew 18:3 and Luke 18:16-17 Jesus taught that the children are not born sinners

Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it

I believe in the wisdom taught by Jesus but I have doubts about some teachings of Paul.

Most people do not follow the harsh teachings which urge us to obey God as taught by Jesus in Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Mark 12:28-34, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like:

‘We are saved by grace through faith apart from works’ - Ephesians 2:8-9

‘Even when we were dead in sins, we are saved by grace’ - Ephesians 2:5

‘A man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law’ - Romans 3:28

‘A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith’ - Galatians 2:16

‘For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse’ - Galatians 3:10

Most people do not follow the harsh teachings like If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away which is taught by Jesus in Matthew 18:9, Matthew 5:29 and Mark 9:47, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like:

‘God has chosen us before the foundations of the world’ - Ephesians 1:4

‘God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation’ - 2 Thessalonians 2:13

‘For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation’ - 1 Thessalonians 5:9

‘But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!’ 1 Corinthians 15:51

‘God has saved us and called us’ - 2 Timothy 1:9

‘we have been justified through faith’ - Romans 5:1, Romans 5:9

Pastors do not teach the true teachings like Matthew 10:8

‘Freely you have received; freely give’; they teach that it is o.k. to reap the financial gifts in exchange of the spiritual gifts and teach the attractive ones

‘And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified’ Romans 8:30

They try to make people feel happy by such attractive teachings in order to receive more donations.

“If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?” 1 Corinthians 9:11

The teachings of the original sin, the atonement, the sin inheritance, and the salvation by faith alone are not taught by Jesus but taught by Paul.

Jesus did not teach that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law; In Matthew 16:27 and John 5:29, Jesus has confirmed that God will reward each person according to his deeds; those are the basic teachings of the old testimony like the verses taught in Psalm 62:12, Ecclesiastes 12:14, and many other old testimony verses

Paul was not educated by Jesus, he appointed himself as an apostle and he claimed to be superior to the disciples. “I do not think I am in the least inferior to those ""super-apostles"" 2 Corinthians 11:5

Paul wanted to compete with the Disciples as written in 2 Corinthians 11: 5, 2 Corinthians 11: 13 Galatians 1: 7-8, Galatians 2: 6-8, Galatians 2: 11 and 1 Timothy 1: 7, Philippians 3: 2, 3: 19, 2 Corinthians 11: 22-23.

“For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ”.

2 Corinthians 11:13

“only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!” Galatians 1:7-8

“But when Peter came to Antioch, I had to oppose him to his face, for what he did was very wrong”. Galatians 2:11

“They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm”. 1 Timothy 1:7

“Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision; for we are the true circumcision”. Philippians 3:2

"I'm just saying  consumer expectations often get in the way of oversights. If maxsoft didn't market them as having the dlc, and boxes don't say it's included. Then they did nothing wrong. They sold a product as advertised. If you assumed you'd get it based on marketing for another region that's naive. The only thing they didn't do was comment on a confusing release.


I could blame them if they misled customers if the packaging says it's supposed to be there then yeah that's wrong but if it ain't listed  I wouldn't expect it to be in there."

"As someone who went to a large school and got trashed constantly, what happened with the friends isn’t that strange. My friends and I would go out and people would sometimes even “Irish exit” and just disappear. Every time this happened we all would just assume they went home and passed out if we were even sober enough to think about it. Getting kicked out isn’t that weird either. At those college bars they are kicking people out all night and if you stumble or spill a drink and you get unlucky with the bouncer seeing it you could get kicked out. Again, me and my friends would just assume they were going home and thankfully they were always in their bed the next morning. You’re right, sometimes it could be different with a girlfriend boyfriend situation and maybe they would leave with them but her sticking around with the other friends still isn’t all that strange. 

Many other aspects of this situation are odd but personally I wouldn’t get too caught up with the friends not looking for him etc.

Edit: Linguistically, it must be variant of the Lazio tendency towards using ‘li’ instead of ‘i’ or ‘gli’ for the plural pronoun. Combined with a sound change for final -i, suddenly you have no masculine plural. So you hear people say, ‘C’ho una fija e due fije maschie’ and the like. "

"Greek Mythology was more demiurge based than creator based. There were gods/things that existed and made the universe, possibly from themselves (although to be fair, so do creator gods they just phrase it differently).

What the first things were differ writer to writer, but it's usually Kaos/Chaos. Although I've seen that described as a mixture of matter, water or a gap.

- Hesiod: “In truth at first **Chaos** came to be”

- Ovid states “Before the ocean and the earth appeared— before the skies had overspread them all— the face of Nature in a vast expanse was naught but **Chaos** uniformly waste.” (sorry to break this subs rule about not mentioning Ovid).

- Aristophanes: ""At the beginning there was only **Chaos, Night**, dark **Erebus**, and deep **Tartarus**. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence.""

- Pherecydes of Syros: “**Chronos** and **Zas** always were, and also **Chthonie**”

- Apollonius: “He sang how the earth, the heaven and the sea, once *mingled together in one form*, after deadly strife were separated each from other”

- ""Apollodorus"": “**Sky** was the first who ruled over the whole world.”

- Homer: ""Since I go now to the ends of the generous earth on a visit to **Okeanos**, whence the gods have risen"""

"Dad,

I’m still close to my friends. By your comments, I assume that stepmonster didn’t tell you that she told me that my friends aren’t welcome here? They cause her too much stress, they’re bad influences, &amp; despite them bring their own snacks, she doesn’t want them eating her food. My friends are very upset at how stepmonster treats me. I don’t know how you’re able to turn a blind eye to it. They see it. But you’re told I’m not using the space or inviting friends over? Now it makes sense to me. Tell me that my friends aren’t welcome here, tell you I’m not using the room as intended.

Let’s make a bet. She’ll do over the room for A &amp; B, we know that. How many times do you think she’ll bring up to me that she’s repainting? You won’t be there, of course. But basically the last in the house that I have, that was done for me out of love, that mom, you, &amp; pawpaw created for me, has to be taken away somehow.

Btw, the jewelry conversation came up again the other day. That would be yet another time stepmonster goes out of her way to bring up that she owns mom’s jewelry to me. She’ll never say it in front of you, so let me bring you up to speed. Out of the blue, repeatedly, she brings up grandmom’s jewelry. And how much she’s looking forward to giving it to her baby girl. That it will be beautiful, starting a tradition of handing down jewelry from one generation to the next.
Out of the blue, dad. Knowing it came from my grandmother to my mom, &amp; was intended for me, &amp; then my daughters. You gave her the knife. She loves to twist it.

Stepmonster told me from the start that I wasn’t part of her family. From the age of 10, mere months after my mom died, when you were telling me she was my new mommy, she made sure I knew the real deal. Between the two of us, she was clear about how this would go down. You’re just not around to see it. You don’t know her like I do. You don’t want to, trust me. It’s much easier to believe it’s a stepmom stereotype, or I’m angry, or I’m acting childish, or I’m going through a teen phase. Otherwise you need to ask yourself why moving 2 toddlers further away from their parents is a smart idea. Or why this lovely woman is gaslighting your teen daughter when you’re not around.

They've been working on it for 8 years, and it's just a really really big deal. I'm not sure what else to equate it to in terms that non-gamers could understand. But I think it's somewhat equivalent to a partner wanting to watch the Super Bowl while on vacation or something like that. Except a more rare event. If he's anything like me he's been anticipating this day for years and years, and the ""1 DAY UNTIL RELEASE"" countdown on the subreddit for the game just went to ""4 DAYS UNTIL RELEASE AND IT'LL BE A WEEKDAY SO YOU WON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO PLAY IT,"" for him. I get why he was probably slightly more emotional than you'd have expected. It's like being a kid about to go to sleep on Christmas Eve and now you find out you have to wait until New Years or something. It's going to sting a bit.

I think it is totally reasonable to request that he wait a few days and not bring the console (especially since you want to play yourself). That is for sure what I would do if it was my anniversary. But I think it's also important to realize that this isn't just a big game, or the biggest game of the year even. It's much more than that. When your anticipation for something is built that much and you have to adjust your expectations, that certainly can lead to some vent off of steam and emotions.  "

"Matt Ryan isn't vastly outplaying Cousins. He's outplaying Cousins. Their stats are very similar, though Cousins has a much lower Y/A because Minnesota runs a lot of short passes. Disregarding Y/A, Cousins is 70% for 2165 yards and 14-3. Those are very similar stats, so I don't get how you think the difference is ""vast"". I'd agree Cousins is behind, and shouldn't be in the talks for MVP, but I have to correct the hyperbole. Cousins stats were actually, if memory serves, better than Ryan's when he was carrying the offense (pre Cards game)."

"Lots of sympathy, I'm from a place like this in eastern Canada and to keep myself moving forwards I got really into doing things outside and reading.

&gt;&gt;I got a cheap road bike for off of Craigslist and instead of driving I'd ride my bike instead (not so much midwinter). It gave me a lot of independence during high school when I had to rely on rides. When the weather was good I had fun trying to bike like two towns over and back in a day.. just pushing yourself to go farther and faster, it was cool to feel your body get stronger and I still think it's such a good way to spend time outside. You can learn to be your own bike mechanic, there's a lot of online resources for working on your bike, + parts are inexpensive.
&gt;&gt;My friends parents owned a canoe so we'd try to do like janky canoe trips up and down rivers and lakes in area, or on a hot day take the canoe out and swim/relax on the water for a while. You can build small sails/learn how to go out on your own, found it really rewarding.
&gt;&gt;Reading is a great way to get out of a small town lol.. I got really into reading books by Ryszard Kapuściński. but travel books, classics, basically just books from different perspectives than my own helped a lot.
&gt;&gt;If you like spending time outside camping is great, you can find tents pretty cheap (usually everyone has a spare too) and then just bring stuff to keep warm, drink, eat and you're fairly set.. lived in the country and on weekends me and my friends would just go camping in the back woods behind my house. I think my interest in camping and canoeing eventually helped me find a healthy, tight-knit and supportive group of friends (sounds really cheesy)."

Good evening lads. Today I’m selling my Swiss-made vintage Delbana Chronograph made sometime in the 1940’s. It is a 34mm case size and features a Landeron 48, 17 jewel chrono movement. It is keeping great time and the Chronograph fuction works flawlessly. I have provided two videos of it doing so. The dial is really cool and has aged very well and contains a mix of subtle reds and blues. The minute, hour, and second are all blued and more visible in certain lights. And the Chronograph counter hand is red. Whoever can guess (via PM) first try what car that shift knob comes from gets $10 off;)

Price: $295 USD obo PM if interested!

Thanks for your time and attention. "

"&gt;You literally just equated a vocal minority with the views of an entire movement while scolding me for doing the same. Okay.....

Yes...that's why I used that as an analogy...to point out how ridiculous it is.  I'm not saying I agree with it...I'm illustrating how it's wrong.

&gt;Of course they wouldn't see it themselves, just as a neo-nazi wouldn't see themselves as being racist or being anti-american. I've talked to Ex-MGTOW's on [/r/exredpill](https://www.reddit.com/r/exredpill) and they definitely see themselves as what outsiders would describe, and that is misogynist assholes spreading propaganda.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another ex-mgtow also described the subreddit as having ""cult-like tendencies"" and I checked their profile to see if it was some troll, they have over 1k post karma in [r/MGTOW](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW) that's alot....atleast for me.

These would be the people that have taken their stance on these issues to unhealthy extremes...and thankfully realized what kind of twats they turned into because of it.  It's just sad to think that they'd now be against the idea, just because they took it too far...rather than staying in the community and helping other people to avoid giving in to their personal frustration.  I've seen a lot of youtubers jump on and off various bandwagons, for a bunch of different reasons...not realizing that they're just switching their focus from one extreme to another, instead of simply calming down, and reevaluating the extent of their opinions.  

&gt; Just to Clarify, MGTOW's going on their own way is not ""extreme"" however their talking points are. They usually hold redpill philosophies, which contain misogynist pseudoscience, and about how ""women shouldn't vote"", stuff like that. 

That's the ""mansplaining"" part I was referring to.  That's a pretty broad brush...and also pretty negative.  You'd be right, if you were only talking about that vocal minority I mentioned...but saying that's what MGTOW is all about, isn't accurate.  Most MGTOW men are simply trying to break the stigma that if they don't have a woman in their lives, then there must be something wrong with them.  It's demoralizing...and it's why there are so many angry Incels out there that hate on women.  When your self-esteem is inherently tied to whether or not women find you attractive enough to date...a lot of guys are going to live very miserable lives.  They need to know that it's ok to be single.  Once they accept that, they can start to be happy...instead of just being angry, lonely people who think all of their problems would solved if only they could just get laid.  MGTOW is actually an effort to rehabilitate Incels...but unfortunately, a lot of them still have a long way to go, before they really ""get it"".  Hating on them for it, doesn't help."
"Untyped bonuses do explicitly stack with themselves -- though that's somewhat besides the point, since the ability isn't a bonus or multiplier in 3e parlance, and isn't subject to that limitation anyway. 

It's pretty clearly not what they had in mind when they made the action point rules, but per the language they used, it works. Moreover, the DM and I both agreed that it worked.

I'm not particularly interested in debating someone trying to rules lawyer something that happened in a game fifteen years ago where they weren't even present, so this is probably a good place to leave it, yes?

"Not likely. In their line of work, they have sex with all sorts of people with all kinds of looks, weights, ages, appearances, heights. 

Some sex workers don't even limit their services to sex. They will also spend time with you, holding, touching, even talking as an initial session with nervous clients. You can see whether you can find someone who offers this for an initial no-sex meeting.. and use it to see how she responds to you :) Even just a half hour. At the end you can even ask her 'Is it okay if I book you again, for more next time?'. I would be willing to bet you'll get a yes! And that might make you feel more confident when it comes to having sex with her, and you'll feel reassured that she feels okay about it."

Having played Runeblade, try to save your dash for when your enemies/boss commits to an attack. If you're battling a large number of enemies, there is little you can do besides burst them down. Bosses are actually easier since you have to just focus on a single enemy. I've also found that you can use short-delay Ground Mounts (Pillow Mounts are a good example) when your dash is down for quick extra movement speed."

"This is a copypasta from another thread I responded in.

 

&gt;The **Difference Between patriotism** and **nationalism** is that the patriot is proud of his country for what it does , and the **nationalist** is proud of his country no matter what it does ; the first attitude creates a feeling of responsibility while the second a feeling of blind arrogance that leads to a war .

[https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/patriotism-vs-nationalism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/patriotism-vs-nationalism)

​

So it's more complicated then good/bad, but in common usage, it is in fact ""Patriotism = good, and Nationalism = bad"".

Some quotes from the article I linked:

&gt;In U.S. usage *nationalism* is now perhaps most frequently associated with [*white nationalism*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/white+nationalism), and has considerably negative connotations.

\-

&gt;Some of us imagined that we dented the nationalism, hatred and racism that roiled the world in the first half of the 20th century.  
—Jeanette Friedman-Sieradski (letter to editor), *The Times-Tribune* (Scranton, PA), 12 Mar. 2017

\-

&gt;And while coded appeals to racism or nationalism aren’t new—two words: Southern strategy—overt calls to temporarily bar Muslims from entry to the United States or questioning a federal judge’s impartiality based on his Mexican heritage are new.  
—Jim Rutenberg, *The New York Times*, 8 Aug. 2016

From Huffington Post as an example of the modern perspective:

&gt;Nationalism and patriotism are two words which are often used inter-changeably. This is incorrect since there is a world of difference between the two concepts, in spite of a few shared ideals. While patriotism fundamentally means affection for one's country and willingness to defend it, nationalism is a more extreme, unforgiving form of allegiance to one's country. As opposed to patriotism, which involves social conditioning and personal opinion, nationalism involves national identity and the belief that one's nation and/or its government is supreme.

[https://www.huffingtonpost.in/sudhanva-d-shetty/patriotism-nationalism-a-\_b\_9354822.html](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/sudhanva-d-shetty/patriotism-nationalism-a-_b_9354822.html)

I would also read the George Orwell quote in the same article.

This seems like a good start."
Maybe the blades cause a bleeding DoT on enemies or something. 
"\-Don't be self-deprecating, it's cringy as fuck unless you clearly have some sort of elevated status you are trying to downplay.

\-Don't show outward signs of thinking you aren't good enough

\-Attempt to limit thoughts of being ""not good enough""  

\-Try not to mentally bully yourself  

\-Just generally try not be or seem miserable, because no one will want to be around you if you act miserable.  

  

That's pretty much it, but it's a tall order that requires some serious rewiring of your brain and habits, and you will tend to slip back all the time."

"when you're driving from the farmhouse bunker to the city, you're on the los santos freeway. If you stay on the road, you'll be right in front of the maze bank arena and around there is a little dirt road / jump right to the entrance of la puerta. I have sourced and sold cars from every vehicle warehouse location, and at la puerta you can drive very fast into the yellow circle without having to slow down. The distance to sales is shorter 2/3 times. Less player traffic aswell, but that isn't very important if you source in public solo sessions. Compared to la mesa it's also a nice change of roads / pathways / scenery. Same reason I moved my Chumash bunker to farmhouse, luxury.

Plus la puerta has a nearby pegasus spawn to get a cargobob, and also a very free entrance, making it easier to deliver cars with the cargobob and to land it. The highway access at la puerta isn't bad at all, you just have to open your eyes to see all the shortcuts rockstar has placed all over los santos. Sadly the gps would never tell you those."

While I hate the rise and fall (and BS articles) that go with crypto, the fact is AMD GPUs do a better job at handling the blockchain and it’s not a market that should be ignored.

"No one can truly know whether He exists or not until (I suppose) we die, so there's really nothing stopping people from believing. If you're saying He hasn't done anything \[for the *world\],* then you probably haven't asked Christians, or other religious people, what He has done for *them.* People have their own experiences and beliefs and perhaps a strong grasp of what/who God is, to the point where they don't care if there's no other form of 'real' evidence aside from their own experience. 

I mean, even in this day and age, 'God' is developing a more ambiguous identity within society. He has gone from being this sure-thing; a guy in the sky doing this, that and the other, to more of a philosophy: while not definitive, He is what made us, guides us to do things, etc., etc.. 

But either way, I don't think it's worth trying to disparage God's existence just because we can't see Him - we can't see a lot of things that happen.

"*""Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Miss Mizuka Lau!""*

The contrast between the excited crowd and the young woman who strutted onto the stage was as deafening as the applause that accompanied her entrance. The billowing blue fabric blended into the background, allowing the gold augments to glisten even brighter. The goggles on her head sat between two perfectly shaped hair buns, completing the steampunk fashion Mizuka had become known for in addition to her prodigious talent.

Smiling knowingly, she raised the violin to her chin, and an expectant hush fell over the crowd. After a tense moment, Lau began to play the first few notes of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. As she played, small pieces of gold detached from her outfit, fluttering like butterflies around the concert hall. They danced in time with the movement, enticing the crowd and allowing the music to fill their body subtly.

As she transitioned into the Summer movement, the shapes, rather than morphing into other creatures, instead sped up their motions. While the butterflies had earlier been flitting about aimlessly, they now dashed across the room, the spotlight reflecting off them to create a dazzling effect of morning sunlight as the piece proceeded into an impromptu crescendo before cutting out suddenly.

When the music began again for the autumn movement, the gold that had been flying now fluttered to the stage, like leaves falling from a tree. From a sitting position, the wings flapped in unison along with the beat. Lau danced around the butterflies, bow flying across the strings as she stepped lithely through the field of gold. 

All at once, the lights went out, and the crowd murmured in discussion. Then, the final movement began. A dim light rose, with Mizuka's head eerily floating in the air. Slowly, she played, a mournful dirge to the finale of the year. The gold began separating into small pieces that spun as she danced, a sparkling snow that elicited an oohing from the crowd.

The gold whirled around her as her fingers played a rhythm on the violin, melding itself back into the attachments that adorned her outfit. Once the last of what had been the butterflies had reattached, she slowly drew the bow across the strings one last time, and let the applause rain over her.

"I never found anything better than +1 Mithral Plate, though it's possible it's out there.  Getting shield on someone isn't very easy either, I don't think I ever saw potions or scrolls of it, so you're looking at an alchemist to pull it off most of the time.  Or maybe a splash of Magus or the like, though swapping armor would get annoying quick.

As far as killing power... the Strength doesn't do much better that I've seen.  The Dex builds tend to just put out more attacks to make up for the difference.  I was wrong on the bracers but just going by what I've seen with pretty crazy levels of gear:

My MC monk:  47 AC, 34 touch
Rogen: 45 AC, 19 Touch
Harrim: 40 AC, 16 Touch

This is before Haste, but Rogen does have his long duration defenses up.  Also Rogen is using medium armor, Harrim is plate and shield, though obviously more optimized towards being a caster than a front liner.

Also shield does not count against Touch apparently.  Rogen has mirror image, but it doesn't last too long when every attack never misses (and basically all attacks in end game are Touch).  He does... basically the same damage as I do, though my chance to hit is waaaay higher than his.

Anyway, it's an issue with the game system at the end of the day more than the game per se.  Though the game does cater better towards Team Dex in itemization.  Getting +8 Bracers is a given.  Getting good Mithral Plate... well I never saw any.  Lots of Adamantine stuff though.

If I wanted I could fairly easily push my Touch AC up to 40 with an item swap. If I wasn't a Monk I'd probably do it.

Still interesting discussion.  Really the issue is that the end game caters heavily to a high Touch AC (as in basically everything uses all Touch Attacks all day long).  And you can't really burst down 10+ dudes with 200+ hps, so that ability to persist is very relevant.

Edit: And yes the game is ""basically over"" but its an entire Chapter/dungeon of this crap.  So it's pretty relevant.  Also the encounters are insanely over your level.  Like multiple CR22+ encounters vs a party of level 15-16.  So when your whole frontline vanishes in a round or two, it kinda matters. "

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle\_doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine)

&gt;A castle doctrine, also known as a castle law or a defense of habitation law, is a legal doctrine that designates a person's abode or any legally occupied place (for example, **a vehicle** or home) as a place in which that person has protections and immunities permitting one, in certain circumstances, to use force (up to and including [deadly force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force)) to defend oneself against an intruder, free from legal prosecution for the consequences of the force used.

Sort of like how Larry Nance Jr was a great player for the Lakers in the years he was here, but you can obviously see that he's overjoyed to be playing for his dad's team, the Cavs, now, which I'm guessing was his favorite childhood team growing up. Same thing happens with Tatum and the Lakers. I'm sure he still likes the team deep down, but there's no way in hell he'd acknowledge it while he's wearing the green."

"Fair enough, I figured he wouldn't like it.  A huge part of it's appeal is involved in playing with the ""generic fantasy setting"" and subverting expectations/showing how fucked up things could be, so someone who doesn't *like* standard fantasy settings probably won't notice or appreciate it.  It's not meant to be an original universe, it's meant to be a different take on a generic universe.

I'm just glad he gave it a real shot.  I read the podcast thread before listening, and thought people were overreacting, but Woolie really was being uncharacteristically Pat-like about it, ""watching the mess"" and implying that people only like the show because it has rape and violence in it.

To be honest, I'm pretty sure goblin slayer spends more time trying to make you laugh than it does trying to disturb you.  The first episode/chapter sort of serves as a warning for how bad things can get, and the rest of the story is actually pretty upbeat with occasionally delving into dark territory.  If people really are watching because they like rape and violence, they're going to be sorely disappointed.

It's really not like berserk at all, I wouldn't even call the world in goblin slayer dark, goblins are just the darkest part of it, which is why it's meaningful that GS himself willingly fights them over and over again, if the whole world was just as dark, there'd be no point in trying to fix his obsession and the plot wouldn't really work.

There's a bunch of rad shit later that he'd probably like, and literally the entire plot is about gradual character development, but if he already has to agonize through the episodes he won't ever like it.  I just hope people don't bug him about it anymore, because discussion about goblin slayer is usually super vitriolic on both sides."

"No, applying at a US consulate and waiting for a visa is exactly what immigration should look like. Showing up at the border and expecting to be allowed in before everyone following the normal process isn't what people should be doing.

If we can increase quotas we should do so - and let those who have been waiting the longest in first. This isn't about letting 5,000 people in or not, this is about *which* 5,000 people should be let in.

Now, if your goal is simply to help as many people as possible, the cost of living is much lower in their home countries - aid would go much further than bringing people into the US. Frankly, helping central American countries is the least we could do after the problems we've caused in the past propping up dictators."

I’ve been around long enough to know that each generation has its artists who are trash and that’s okay. I am by no means a purist who believes that their generation was the best generation. Even the 90s, which is hailed as the best era of hip hip, had plenty of trash.

Are you taking CHEM 101 or CHEM 107 this current semester?

However, it’ll leave such students to 8 science credit hours (CHEM and PHYS), and the UCC requires 9. Other than that, I have no other information regarding next semester’s schedule."

"Ussop isnt goint to die. Everyone bases this off the ""Ussops lies always come true"" but Ussop doesnt lie about dying. He either states that he thinks hes going to die (because he is being a coward) or when he states his dream to become a great warrior of the seas. Luffy has also said several times that wont let anyone die. He wont let Ussop die."

"&gt; WoW's team needs to finally accept that they made extremely stupid and regressive decisions that make the game less fun to play. Yet they still remaining unflinchingly stubborn, keeping steady with their bad concepts and poorer execution.

Isn't reverting those changes gradually an admission of their faults? 
The fact that they're taking a step in the right direction is good, and should be recognized. They could well have just kept right along going with what they were doing, but they aren't. They're listening to feedback and making changes based on that feedback, isn't that what we want?! "

4. Democrats openly support BLM despite it being the ideology that led to some policemen being murdered by a supporter of it.

What does ""consistent pattern"" mean? Again, if you don't define that, then nothing will satisfy you. If you can find a period of 2 months where nothing happened, you can say say the pattern was broken while Trump's pattern was consistent because he only broke it for no longer than 1 month, or some new arbitrary distinction like that.

You have to objectively define your rules before you start evaluating them. Otherwise you can never get any conclusion except what you already wanted to begin with. If your rules are so narrow that nobody else can fit them, then sure, you'll be right, but only in a narrow and unimportant way.

EDIT: I didn't notice before, but you're trying to form a description unique to Trump. That's trivial because every president will have their own unique pattern of behavior. Yes, if you make a detailed enough list of rules, you can certainly choose them so they fit Trump and nobody else. But so what? It doesn't make him worse than anyone else, just different, which is always going to be true anyway, so it's completely uninteresting.

In science, this is called hypothesis fishing. Here's a graphic demonstration of how you can make your favorite political party look like the best:

"The idea i had for Ninten would be a **""semi-clone"" of Ness**, but with a TON of moves from many other characters in Smash. He would really be the Frankenstein monster of the series in that regard.


Since Ninten doesn't use Yo-yo's, he would have **Lucas's Down and Up Smashes**(maybe make his Up Smash much faster but also much weaker to keep that unique ability to Lucas), but he WOULD however, have his other equipment from EarthBound Beginnings.  His **Forward Smash would be Ness's**, but he would also have a boomerang and a sling shot. And well? We do have chibi-like characters with boomerangs and slinshots in Smash, so why not use it? **His Forward Special would be Toon Link's Boomerang**, and his **Back and Forward Aerial would be Villager**'s slingshot.


Then we would also have his other 3 Specials: His **Neutral Special would be Brainshock**. It would use the same animation Lucas uses when he uses PK Fire and he would shoot a projectile that dazes the opponent(the same effect caused by Mewtwo's Down Special, Disable).


Now his **Up Special** would be functionally identical to **Zelda's Farore's Wind**, being called 4th Dimensional Slip. a tear in space would show up where he is, he would enter it, and then another tear would rip the sky where he would come out.


His **Down Special** would be **PK Shield**, and it would be similar to Fox's *Reflector*, but it would be in the shape of a diamond. In fact, all of his PK effects would be diamond-shaped, just like Ness's attacks are circle-shaped, and Lucas's attacks are hexagon-shaped.


I have no idea on what he could do as a Final Smash, so i willl leave that open.


Lastly, i think Ninten should keep **Ness's old Up Aerial** since he has a new(bad) one. He could also have **Lucas's Down Tilt, Back Throw and Down Throw**, but have a version of **Ness Forward Throw** whose knockback actually scales up. This could be his Kill Throw.


All the moves i didn't mentioned would be identical to Ness's."

"Only a little bit. 

I think it's mostly a combination of ""the grass is always greener"" and assumptions about ""what comes naturally"". 

There's a lot of... ""Men act, women are"" in culture. And so a lot of men feel like they are not allowed to ""be"" and women feel like they are not allowed to ""act"". So men and women are both kind of ""pleasantly surprised"" with comments on the ""other's"" side of the grass. It's kind of how compliments work in general, they become less valuable with abundance.

Personally, I rarely get told compliments on my appearance, and I kind of get the idea of just feeling like you go unnoticed and unseen because of that. It can be hard. Similarly, I do get a lot of compliments on things I say or things I write. Which start blurring together unless someone is particularly enthusiastic after a while. It stops really feeling like ""a nice compliment"" and starts feeling like the ""way people talk to me"". 

This is even mirrored in how other people expect things of me too. I have had professors be *annoyed* that I would consider *not* going to grad school. Like some insecurities about my expected performance were the most irrational thing to ever come out of my mouth. 

It begins to feel like ""pressure"". ""If other people do X, it's okay. But you, Eager_Question, are supposed to be good at this. So I better not see anything below an X+2!""

And this can touch on toxic masculinity and how men feel so pressured to be ""fine"" and do everything and ""be a man"" in the face of adversity that... They don't seek help if they have depression or anxiety. And they don't *get* help if they seek it, sometimes. And their problems get worse, and their lives get worse, and they suffer.

So... imagine if you suddenly started getting the compliments you want... Do you really think they would keep their power? Or would you get used to them after a while?"

"Not sheet music, that's for sure. I've collected so much of it over the years and it sits on a shelf not being used. The sheet music I don't use turns to clutter. The sheet music I do use, the paper wears out. Seams crack and it gets torn. Pages turn yellow.

Last year I went through it, organized it, and recycled the songs I didn't want. Now I put a lot of my sheet music on a tablet now. You can download it or screenshot it and keep a file of it. A tablet doesn't necessarily last a long time considering how quickly electronic devices become obsolete, but you can hang onto the files for a long time and most importantly it doesn't create clutter.

"&gt; PvP has its own community which does tournaments of its own and teaches the newcomers how to body each other.

Our PvP is a joke and the game's not even balanced around it. There's no class in the game that can kill a healer in a 1v1, period. Not even other healers. PLD is almost as strong simply because they have a self-heal, but since the problem isn't about self-heal potency so much as mana efficiency, PLD eventually is unable to restore mana fast enough to keep their health up. 

Like, our PvP can be fun because fun is subjective, but our PvP is not well-designed. Design is not subjective."

Maybe she doesn’t want to bother or distract you from your college life or maybe she has things on her own going on that she doesn’t want to bother you with. Just because you aren’t as close and don’t speak as often as you once did or would like to doesn’t mean you have to end the friendship. If you are drifting away and she doesn’t want to talk about it then just let it fade and leave it at that,  but don’t deliberately end it if there isn’t a solid reason or if you guys aren’t on the same page.

"You want to unl8ck all kingdoms first, then get all to lvl 3 (no higher than 5). Then focus on one kingdom at a time. Hey the 5 magic bonus kingdoms leveled to 10 first as that will help you the most. It's silverglase, and then the other 4 are all in the bottom left quadrant of the map. 

Remember that this game has been around for years, adding content along the way to keep high level players interested. It can be overwhelming for new players because you want to do everything. But you really need to focus on leveling your kingdoms and completing all the kingdoms questlines (This will give your hourly income a boost so you have more hold to level with).

Focusing on these first will get you to a better place, you will get new troops from finishing questlines as well. 

Arena is also really great for new to mid-level players,  every one is basically on a level playing field and you will get to play around with different cards to see how they work. Plus you get a good amount of gold and souls from it. "

People that dress alt are signalling that they don't give a fuck, they don't care about being broadly appealing or approachable to most people. I'm not sure you understand that about the styling. If you don't give a fuck, if you want to use your clothing as a beacon for people with similar aesthetic taste or if you see yourself as a living art piece go ahead and continue dressing this way. But here you keep saying you want to be better liked and fit in better and be more approachable and that is at odds with your current aesthetic, you're gonna have to dress differently to get the effect you want.

"FFG manage it pretty well with their games so I don't really think GW has a great suite of excuses for why some basic things, including entire armies (GK, Termies, landspeeders) remain unadjusted for so long. They've been pretty good at patching certain decried things, but they definitely miss stuff and are less on top of it all as a whole. 

Moving to the app away from print published points values will be pretty huge I think. Xwing 2.0 has moved to an App for points values, and I think that's a great solution.

At FFG, they do closed testing groups with their most enthusiastic fans and faction/internal balance is clearly a focus. GW seem to look at chapter approved as a product with lots of extra stuff added, rather than an essential balance update. Perhaps a key difference."

"I've been watching too long to give up on the show, but I was honestly ready to throw it out after eps 1&amp;2. Rosa saved it a little but I'm still so mad about the lack of character and relationships for the companions and the Doctor. They don't interact well for me, and they don't bounce off each other in the timey wimey conversations. They just all ask questions. All the time. Without answers. And they like to repeat the entire plots of episodes so far when a development is added just to make sure we fully understand what we've already been told a hundred times. 

But I've seen a lot of praise for the series so far so if they give the companions real relationships to each other and characters of their own sometime soon I can see myself getting into it. I'm still very sceptical about Chibnall not having a series arc, it's always really tied it all together before and given a goal. And a little bit more of the Doctor's character coming through in Whitaker's performance/writing would be nice - I'd like a good angry speech from her, we haven't really seen a great deal of dark brooding Doctor and that's really helped define the character since it began.

"Materials and Diff Eq should be fine.  Some variation in difficulty is possible between professors, but neither are particularly bad.
Statics isn't conceptually difficult, but has a lot of homework.  Keep up with it and try to attend the live lectures to keep yourself in that rhythm.  
Numerical Methods with Mei is legendarily bad.  I don't know anything about the new guy, Brooks, other than he's fresh out of his Ph.D. (from here), he's not Mei, and he's teaching it now.  While it is possible to skip this and take MAS3114 instead, I do not recommend doing that.  Regardless of professor, you're going to learn some basic methods in Matlab that you'll use for the rest of your career and it's probably better to do that in a class than on the fly.
Physics lab is a joke, just read the instructions and get your prelabs done on time.
Physics lecture, on the other hand, is taught the exact opposite of the way it should be.  Go to class for clicker points, but be ready to use outside resources (MIT OpenCourseWare, Studyedge, SPS tutoring, etc.) to make up for overstuffed lectures and overworked TAs.

Bottom line:  This is doable but may be difficult wrt time management.  If you have to drop one, I'd recommend EGM3344.  Better to finish critical tracking early so you don't have to worry about it.  Keep in mind it's a prerequisite for EML3301C (MoMLab), EML4312 (Controls), and a few other labs and required electives.  They are further down the line, but always keep prereqs in mind.

But yeah I noticed somewhere along the trippy Ass way there, that I no longer gave 2 shits about alcohol. Could talk about it, walk through the beer isle, joke about it - didn’t give it a thought much less a craving lol. So if nothing else, if I can hang on to that, this was worth it!

Nice job dude. thank you for this.
"**Castle doctrine**

A castle doctrine, also known as a castle law or a defense of habitation law, is a legal doctrine that designates a person's abode or any legally occupied place (for example, a vehicle or home) as a place in which that person has protections and immunities permitting one, in certain circumstances, to use force (up to and including deadly force) to defend oneself against an intruder, free from legal prosecution for the consequences of the force used. The term is most commonly used in the United States, though many other countries invoke comparable principles in their laws.

A person may have a duty to retreat to avoid violence if one can reasonably do so. Castle doctrines lessen the duty to retreat when an individual is assaulted within one's own home.

***

**Deadly force**

Deadly force, also known as lethal force, is use of force that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death to another person. In most jurisdictions, the use of deadly force is justified only under conditions of extreme necessity as a last resort, when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed.

Firearms, bladed weapons, explosives, and vehicles are among those weapons the use of which is considered deadly force. The use of non-traditional weapons in an offensive manner, such as a baseball bat, sharp pencil, tire iron or other, may also be considered deadly force.

"Got the skull key at the beginning of summer and repaired the bus early instead of upgrading my coops and barns so I can get iridium quicker.  
  
After that, I just went down the skull mines every day and mostly killed those big purple slimes. When they die, they either give you 3 slime balls or split into smaller slimes. And those small slimes have a chance to drop iridium ore, iridium ingots, and diamonds. So I just farmed those every time I went down the mines; with all the time I spent in the mines, the slimes probably gave me enough iridium for 14 ingots, the rest were the ore vein themselves. Then it was just a matter of reaching Level 9 Farming to be able to craft the sprinklers, and voila. I also placed Lightning Rods as early as I could to get enough battery packs."

"**(Part 2, because Reddit doesn't like me)**

&gt;But on the other hand, picking up a Nailgun when you also have the Crovel is a good pick as you go through the waves, since the two weapons are so very different. They compliment each other, rather than compete for almost an identical role.

The Nailgun is not meant to clean trash, at least not how I use it (I rarely use it, but when I do it's for pesky Cheeseburgers and Fleshpounds). Katana + Nailgun could feasibly work, if only Katana had enough stumble to perform a takedown with it.

&gt;So while a SCAR + FAL (or AR15 and Bullpup if you will) might seem redundant since they can fulfill similar roles, they still help each other out, since you get a bigger ammopool.

The FN FAL is more used to kill HVTs than it is used for trash.

&gt;While buffing the Katana could make it objectively a bit better than the Crovel, could it be buffed enough (useage-wise / economy-wise) so you don't just outright *still* skip the Katana and head for the Zweihander?

If it was buffed to be as good or a bit better than the Crovel, there would be a reason to buy the Katana rather than the Zweihander: you want to use the Katana.

Yes, even us ""meta elitists"" give concessions in this manner. IF the Katana was alongside the BC/Sister Fisters/Crovel, then it'd be given the same treatment as those options. If you don't wanna use the Zweihander, there are still slightly worse options for you. Keyword, slightly. And given that the Katana is Everybody's Favorite Bad Weapon^(TM), it'd also increase the amount of players being effective. Win-win.

&gt;Just to make a slight point here; Imagine if the Katana instead was a Ninja-to (or at least had the same feature I'm about to suggest). The Ninja-to is similar weapon to the Katana, but its sheathe sometimes had a couple of small hidden throwing daggers (among other things, like a poison vial at the end of the sheathe). Then, what if, say, the reload-button let you toss a recoverable dagger (which you'd max be able to carry two, maybe even poisoned?)? That'd give it a bit of change with a potentially massive impact in playstyles and options. Even if the Katana otherwise remained intact (maybe with that buff to altfire stumble though?), it'd at least offer something truly DIFFERENT to the Crovel, and might make it worthy to pick up along the way.

I do not like that suggestion. I think the difference between the Crovel and Katana would be the same as the Katana and the Road Redeemer, being that one would be slashing/piercing and another would be bludgeon. That's enough to create a paradigm of preference, no need to get complicated tbh.

Speaking of which, I think if the Road Redeemer had 100 stumble, it too would be as good as the Crovel. Not better, as unlike the Katana popping a Rioter head would require a light attack and not a stab.

... but I do think that throwing stars or throwing knives would be hella fun."

"As far as Anxiety/Depression goes I'm sure people just described the symptoms without having a name for what they were feeling.

PTSD is a little different. Soldiers have always suffered from PTSD but it just wasn't recognised as a medical condition more than someone simply going insane.  The prevalence of PTSD was also correlated with the emergence of artillery. Artillery is loud, devastating and can hit you anywhere on the battlefield. The constant threat of being bombarded and the stress of being on high alert for an indefinite period of time is what wears on a persons mind. 

In the days before indirect artillery soldiers fought face to face and knew when and where the threat was. They formed up, marched to the battlefield, fought for a few hours at most and marched away afterwards. Where as with the advent of indirect artillery/air power a battle could last for months since 2 armies didn't need to be within sight of eachother to engage."

"I work in mobile games. In order to be profitable you have to get about 5-25$ dollars per install on average (the variance depends on device type, game type, and ios vs android).  A game could charge that amount up front and not have microtransactions, but they would get significantly less initial installs due to the upfront purchase cost. So at the end of the day they company would get less money. The market for games is simply following the consumers desire not to purchase a mobile game up front for say 20-60$ at the same volume as the same volume as the same game free. "
