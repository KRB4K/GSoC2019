Well that's not helpful at all. I think we have a political violence problem if anything. Especially when people choose to ignore their side of the street.   That's frightening that you think that way.  I'm gonna assume you didn't support the mass shooting of Republicans but now I'm wondering about others in this post

"I, too, have locked myself out of my room on at least two occasions. 

1) High school trip to the Soviet Union; someone banged on my hotel room thinking another classmate was staying with me. But I was only wearing a towel when I took a step too far to point out where our classmate was staying. Being a high schooler, he laughed his ass off and walked away as soon as we both realized what that “click” was behind me. I had to go down in the elevator with just a towel, and got yelled at by the concierge all the way back up for my inappropriate behavior. As if I’d done it on purpose, lady. Just look at the KGB tape! I’m sure they saw what happened!

2) In my twenties, driving back home to Michigan from Florida in the dead of winter, I stopped at a motel to get some sleep. I realized I’d left something in my truck, so I ran out in just my boxers to get it. However, the door to my room was heavier than I thought and flipped out the chair I was using to prop it open. Luckily I had a pair of shorts in my truck, so I put those on, and then hustled barefoot in 35 degree weather back to the office and woke the manager up for the second time in twenty minutes to get a new key. 

I am now so paranoid I won’t shut the hotel door without the key physically in my hand. "

Gender by definition has two meanings. A biological definition and a social/cultural the reason for the ladder is because enough people have accepted that its socially acceptable to refer to a man becoming a woman as female thus creating a need for two definitions. As far as multiple genders being added to that definition will rely on if society embraces the notion

"Well you can do your own assessment to some extent without a lot of effort:

Download and run MBSA on your server since it's Windows:

https://www.computerweekly.com/tip/Microsoft-security-tools-MBSA-and-MSAT-explained

Put nmap on a laptop and if your server is public facing either VPN out of the network or do the scan from home:

nmap --script vuln IP_ADDRESS

You can also download a free version of nessus I believe and run a scan on the server. If possible do this as a credentialed scan to get a more in depth look at your server. It doesn't hurt to scan your router too and any switches you have. Scan everything with nmap or nessus or both.

Do you have a web site? Download OWASP ZAP and scan it. Burp is better but the free version doesn't allow for an active scan.

Ask yourself if your defenses are layered. Can your network survive a click? If an end user clicks a phishing link and loses their credentials or downloads ransom ware, how far will the threat travel before something stops it? Just the compromised work station? The network share? Other work stations? The server system partition?

You need layered defenses, not just AV on workstations and backups but also a local firewall properly configured. Your server should also have AV and a firewall. I am guessing you don't have a logging solution probably but you should. This might be a step beyond your MSPs ability but you can set up a free Splunk server as long as your log volume is under a certain amount daily. It shouldn't be on your SBS server, but a raspberry Pi could handle it, and outside of labor maybe cost $50 if that?

Ask your MSP about DNS. Where are your systems pointing for DNS? Is it a safe server that will block known malicious requests? Ask them the click question too. How far would an attacker get? What happens if ransom ware gets on your server? How long would it take them to restore from backups after cleanup? How far back do your backups go and how frequent are they?

If you want to grasp the basics, find a CompTIA Security+ study guide. You don't have to take the test, just go over the study guide to grasp the basics. That will help you shape some better questions to ask your MSP and hopefully they can answer them right. PM if you have more questions. "

I'm not sure what your asking. Does it come with the 4k textures on the install disc? Unlikely as there's a bunch of people buying the game who won't need that. Until disc space gets bigger I see that always being an additional download  If you're asking if the x enhancements are ready for launch then yes. Game is confirmed to run in native 4k and doubt they'd launch without that.

First year law is really popular though, so you'll have plenty of like-minded people whatever hall you get put into.

Really good advice 
"The story is good from Ch.1, in my opinion, but do yourself a favor and finish the first two chapters as swiftly as possible. And finish Ch.2 by salvaging, not by trying the side quests. Don't worry about things becoming more complicated, and take the story as it comes along. It's fairly easy to follow, but I'm sure you've noticed a lot of discussion and fanfare surrounding the game. There's of course a reason for all that. Just don't expect things to be too complicated from the get-go, it's all about character *development*, so just get to know them as you go.  
  
There's a natural tendency for JRPG players to try to avoid rushing the game, but you want to kinda rush those first two chapters. Even though the game lets you go off an explore before (at the start of Ch.2), you really probably shouldn't.  
  
The (ch.2) story events and difficulty won't really require you to grind for anything, and IMO the side quest route is more so meant to teach you about coming back to things anyway.  
  
You won't miss out on anything by not exploring solo (in Ch.2). The game's mechanics/combat are based on a team, so there's no reason to try to solo anything (in ch.2). A lot of the mechanics are even locked til further on anyway (past ch.2).  
  
A couple of the most common complaints/posts for advice are ""why's everything killing me?"", and ""why does it take so long to kill anything?"", and they're almost always from the beginning of Ch.2, while trying to explorer with Rex by himself.  
  
After you finish Ch.2, and have your initial team, you can then explore and do whatever you want to do at your leisure (or dismay, because you're going to be killed a lot as you learn about your surroundings).  
  
You asked about how long the story takes to ramp up, and how long it takes before the combat becomes fun, which is a *horrible* way to start things (I mean... you haven't even started). However, both the games story *and* the mechanics of the game will continually grow over time.  
  
But since you've raised warning flags, I'll go ahead and reiterate some additional advice: **don't just skip through those easy 1-2-sentence tutorials**, because everything is eventually going to stack on top of each other. They're not too complicated, but you're not going to remember them if you never learn them, and you're not going to ""just know"" how everything works later on."

"Would the climate change due to pole shifts? It's my understanding the climate is different at different latitudes because of the different exposure to the sun, not because of magnetic poles (and if your geographic poles have changed, I'm not sure there'd be any humans left alive).

Edit: There is some material online about the *strength* of the magnetic poles affecting amount of rain falling, but the first few results I found were from sources that seem like climate change deniers, so I'm not sure they hold any weight.

Another question is, how did those sea levels get lowered? The melted sea caps imply a *higher* ocean level, so I assume some science fiction went down and stole large amounts of Earth's water. This would be counterproductive to rainforests, as they require a lot of rainfall to maintain such growth."

"{Kentucky} 23, Mizzou 17

No team has scored more than 20 against the Cats this season and I think that streak continues on Saturday. Lock has been a very average QB against SEC defenses and Kentucky’s defensive strength is in its experienced secondary (who have all started and played multiple years against Lock) and a strong pass rush led by Josh Allen and Boogie Watson. If Mizzou wins this game it’ll be because they were able to run the ball well against us and hold Benny to a lower than usual rushing total. 

Our passing game struggled against A&amp;M and was pretty much abandoned against Vandy due to the high winds and a couple shaky plays early from Wilson. If Wilson is close to 200 total yards (rushing and passing) then Kentucky is going to be a hard team to beat this year. If not, then we’re going to be playing a lot of nail biting games

"Apologies for the late response.

Jesus [AS] was ethnically a Jew. The Jews were Hebrews who descended from Judah. Judah was the son of Jacob, and the father of the tribe of Judah (one of twelve Jewish tribes).

We believe, as Muslims, that all people are born in a state of submission to God - a predisposition to believe in, and submit one's will to, God. The one who submits their will to God is called a Muslim.

Jesus [AS] was born in this state of submission to God. He was born a Muslim.

I do not believe we know the name of the religion Jesus [AS] grew up in/with. We do know that he kept the Law given to Moses [AS].

Jesus, during his short mission, taught the Law given to Moses, and this would make him a Muslim - even by the common modern standard/post the prophethood of Muhammad [PBUH]. Those alive pre-Muhammad [PBUH], who followed what Jesus [AS] taught, are considered as Muslim as those who follow Muhammad [PBUH] today. The same goes for those who followed what was taught by Moses [AS] pre-Jesus [AS], and so on, so forth. These people will be judged in the same way the Muslim today will be judged for following the prophet Muhammad [PBUH]."

Even then there are plenty of arguments that this law would violate 4th amendment privacy against unreasonable searches and the 5th amendment's privilege against self-incrimination, which provides protection for the privacy of personal information.

Or, how about WA's constitution, which the WA Supreme Court declared, ""it is by now axiomatic that article I, section 7 provides greater protection to an individual's right of privacy than that guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.""

"From my experience, it works for a first blood kill when they don't even bother looking at your runes, or see them and think ""meh whatever"" but then go ""wait, what's going on... this isn't how my early is supposed to go!"". After that either the Jayce knows what to expect and plays smarter, or plays very defensively and doesn't even uses melee form until he gets dirk and hammer.

Though I can't say I have used approach velocity with glacial augment since the ones I use it on are melee."

"What are you currently good at?

What keys are you pushing?

Are you in a guild/dedicated group?

If you're not pushing high digit keys then most any tank can work, the hardships of individual class balance aren't seen until you and the group you're playing with are all at a high level, which I assume you're not because you're asking us what the FOTM would be when any decent tank will tell you to not worry about it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To answer the question for anyone else coming into this thread, Death Knights, Demon Hunters, and Brewmasters aren't picked because they're numerically the strongest...it's because they have an insane amount of utility to bring to a fight. Self heal, mitigation (especially from magic dmg), and strong CC means you will stay competitive unless Blizz nerfs you to the absolute floor which is unlikely.

Warrior is missing the mitigation needed to be competitive in the absolute highest levels of play but the vast majority of players won't be there so if you like your Prot play him.

Druid is the only tank that should be benched if you have any interest in getting groups b/c the inability to access your utility from Bear form and no consistent ""Oh shit"" abilities makes them the weakest tank this patch. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even with that I've seen those dedicated players who love their bear absolute beast mode (pun intended) runs. Mastering your class should come well above whatever the patch favorite is."
"Both have some history with being considered. To put long stories short, Mach Rider was originally considered for Melee's retro rep before Ice Climbers, but was cut due to Sakurai having difficulties planning a moveset around the motorcycle. As for Chorus Kids, there is evidence suggesting a Rhythm Heaven fighter was planned for Smash 4 thanks to some leftover data in the files. Considering the only other planned fighter was Chrom, and both him and the Chorus Kids were the only loose ends in the infamous Gematsu leak, they got a decent following from that. From what I can gather, they recieved a decent sum of votes in the Smash Ballot."

"If your niece/nephews had genetic testing that was positive (and identified the specific familial mutation in the TWIST1 gene that is present), then you would need to determine if you were tested for that specific mutation. It's highly unlikely that 23andMe/Ancestry chips cover any meaningful number of true mutations in this gene.

Single mutation targeted testing would be the best way to go-- you just need a copy of your niece/nephew's genetic test result, and a genetic counselor can order it for you from a medical grade laboratory. It's important that the lab doing your testing has a copy of your niece/nephew's result so that they can confirm that you are absolutely being tested for the correct mutation, and that they are technically able to detect that mutation. But this is something where proper medical grade testing would be needed, not a DTC chip.

"I can agree in part to this, but you have to also admit that the role of an Asian man isn't really her place to play.

I personally think that we would be better off if the movie went forward, but our main concern was one of representation. It's like casting a white person and putting them in blackface instead of casting a black person instead.

Employment discrimination is such a real issue facing our community, and instead of casting a trans man to play the role of a trans man, they got a cis woman. This not only pushes trans people out of the industry, (if they won't cast a trans person for a trans role, then when will they?) but also has the underlying mindset that trans men are 'actually' women. Which is transphobic and counterproductive to our cause. 

Anyway, there are a bunch of reasons the community was displeased. Whatever I personally feel, I do think there are some valid concerns.

"Right now I'm trying to convince myself that they are fake, but I'm more inclined to ""team leaks are real""

And if they are in fact real, I kinda like them...

I  made  thread a while ago about how hilarious it would be if the show ended up being way more gay than we expected but with none of the ships people wanted, and if these are real, that's kinda what happened, with the ""bonus"" that Allurance won't be endgame as well so no one is happy and we can all be miserable together xD

&amp;#x200B;

So about Allura/Allurance:

I reeeally hope Allura doesn't die, despite what the statue sugests.

The shot with her and Lance looks like a goodbye, which makes me believe that she will have to leave with her people, for new Altea or Oriande or whatever, because she has a responsability to them. And here enters Lance ""romance arc"".

From very early on, the creators implied that Lance had a romance arc, but said that he wouldn't get what he wanted, but rather what he needed. Many of us took that as meaning a person, so he wouldn't be with Allura but rather with Keith, or Pidge or whoever your shipper's heart beats for.But maybe what it meant is that in the end he will choose something else over romance.

I thinks he likes Allura, and right now she is realizing that she might like him too, I believe they will at some point next season confess their feelings, but then it turns out that Allura has to leave with the Alteans, and Lance realizes that he can't leave with her, because he needs to stay on Earth with his family and the paladins. So they say goobye, cry, maybe kiss, and go their separate ways.

And I don't think that this is bad character development for Lance, it's actually pretty good. The ""lover boy"" realizes that there are things that he needs to do more than getting the girl.

""But what about Coran? Why didn't he leave with Allura then?"" It has been established that Coran is one of the ""less magical"" Alteans, it might have something to do with that. It might also be that he stays behind as some kind of embassador, or that when all is said and done and Allura grows into her role as Altean Queen/Empress, he may decide that his role as his protector and his promise to her father have been fullfiled, and ask to stay behind.

&amp;#x200B;

About LGBT representation:

Even if people are complaining that it's rushed, Shiro marrying a dude on screen, kiss and all (be it Roy or Adam that turns out to be alive) 100% confirms him as gay for anyone watching. And if he's gay at the end he has also been gay the entire show, he's been an awesome badass character who happen to be gay with no room for doubts. And that's pretty good in my opinion. Could be better? Sure, but its way more than we usually get. (apart from Steven Universe which is basically just a show about lesbians)

Adding to that, one of the most recent leaks shows Keith with the Blades, handing out suplies to refugees, and in the background there's Ezor and Zethrid helping him, which means they didn't die afterall. So there you go, space lesbians, one more canon LGBT couple

And who knows, we may still get VeronAcxa  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  (jk xD)

&amp;#x200B;

About the ships:

They are all dead, and seriously, that's what this fandom deserves.

If the leaks are real, Sheith is definitly dead, so no more arguing about who's a pedophile or a predator, or if they're contributing to negative gay stereotypes. Keith is legal but it doesn't matter anyway because Shiro marries another dude so case closed.

Allurance happens but then doesn't so no need to fight over it as well.

And Klance? Well Klance is canon king obvioulsy... (jk)

There's nothing in the leaks that indicates that Klance can be canon, so I'm preeeetty sure it won't be as well. Good, no more arguing about klantis or the level of toxicity of Lance stans.

It's over, no one's ships were endgame. The End. No one gets to ""win"", no one gets to boast about being ""right"", we all ""loose"", we can all cry.

"&gt; It’s madness to say ‘there’s no evidence it’ll work, but I’m just going o assume it will’.

Well, shit, is it madness for a depressed person to stay alive? I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think this way about faith.

It is OK to assume a thing is true **without a solid reason** if you meet some criteria. 

1. It is not going to worsen other peoples lives. 

2. It is going to make you or someone else happy/satisfied in some way. 

3. You’ve made the decision yourself.

In your own words, if a thing has a heavy (negative) impact on people, it’s not OK to assume it is true without good reasons.

&gt;Wouldn’t your faith have a strong impact on how you vote on these issues?

It depends entirely on how you choose to interpret your relationship with God. If it includes believing that abortion is murder, okay. It doesn’t have to. Those views say a lot more about you and your character than they do about the validity of faith in God. I think what worries you is how people choose to express their faith, whether they let themselves fall to bias and vote blindly in line with how the church/media tells them to vote. If you’re not making the decision yourself, it’s not really okay, especially if someone will suffer for it.

Faith is about one thing and one thing only - do you believe? Tick yes or no. Everything else is added flavour, and I mean *everything*.  Even the “god is benevolent/omnipotent/omniscient/aware of humanity in the first place” part is optional if you personally believe that to be the case. You can believe God is Azathoth if you really want to. You are completely allowed to hold that view and anyone who says otherwise is full of shit, the most they can tell you is that you’re not Catholic/Christian/whatever. Which is fine, labels exist for a reason.

Faith is fundamentally an internal decision, believe if you think it’s good for you, if you don’t, then don’t. It’s not okay to use it as an excuse to do evil or misguided things (obviously). Whether you express your faith constructively or destructively is down to the individual."

Basic — a pejorative for conforming to a standard. Being just another face in the crowd. For example, frat bros are basic because they challenge no expectations. People who wear Gap clothes are basic because the look is indistinguishable. Back in the day we used to say “generic.”

Extra — a pejorative for trying too hard, doing more than is needed. Perceived as showing off. If there was a spectrum, “extra” might be at opposing side of “basic” — yet both are still a pejorative. 

Perhaps this is horseshoe theory for kids?"

I based the teams and their cities based off of the stadiums in the game. I gave all of the stadiums a location and the cities that the teams are from are around the locations of the field. The closest stadium to Denver would have been swagger center or red rock. I already had two teams at swagger and two at red rock. only one spot left in the division and that went to the only team that plays in colonial plaza which is the Mexico Cheetas. So there is room for me to add some cities/states that people suggest but unfortunately Denver doesn't really fit in

"Lmao you think your points were so good that I need a white flag to surrender to your superiority…you must have been called special a lot as a kid, huh?

Alright fine. I’ll give you your explanation. I’ve got time. Not gonna make it long, but I’m curious as to why you think she’s easy. 

1. Mindless.

Not if you’re playing her effectively. You need situational awareness, ult tracking capabilities (moreso than other heroes as you can actually do something about it), coordination, and timing. 

2. Low skill floor/highly effective and high impact/low effort.

This is the same point twice. I’m guessing you just used four to make more text so you could look smarter because there’s absolutely no objective value from including this twice.

Hack is easy and ult is easy. Her primary fire is hard. It has wide spread and low damage. Knowing how to use her abilities is also very hard. That could go under mindless as well.

3. Anti fun.

Not really. You can still move at least. Better than any other CC in the game.

I look forward to your explanation. Or your white flag. Probably the same thing considering what I’ve seen from you so far."

I was thinking like jump rope for 500 jumps then bear-hug carry a sandbag around the outside of my gum (maybe 200-250m?).  3 rounds or something.  The hardest part of this might be keeping track of jumps up to 500.

"The removal of the overcharge drain ulti combined with the removal of any form of hp on ranged feels to me as if BW isn't as great as everyone is making her out to be.

Pyro is pretty much dead not for the same reasons. Being able to spam magic was way too excessive, but now there's overcharge and that's that. No hp from ranged so you can't even vent without turning to melee very often. The hp talents on pyro are weird as well.

The lingering DoT seems good on paper, but after many runs and many experimentation, it's not as good as you might think. The harder your party goes, the worse contributions of BW become. You CAN set groups of enemies on fire, but before your DoT comes anywhere close to scratching the enemy, your team mates will have likely killed them already.

It is still good against hordes, but... hordes. Hordes were never a problem in this game.

RV is still good and VERY much better than any fire mage is. So is the huntsman provided you have ""good"" aim (1/3 headshot for sustain). BH still works out somewhat. It can at the very least outperform any fire mage in terms of elite killing.

They should add talents to the fire mages that give them health on ranged damage/kill/crit whatever, so that there's a chance to vent often enough. Sienna's melee weapons are sub-par compared to anything else the other 4 heroes can bring so it's not quite fair to give her the same health talents.

Heat sink is completely useless now, so every mage is going to run TE. But even with TE, on BW, you overheat very, very quickly. You can kill a few elites with a fireball staff before having to switch to melee and wait (provided they are clumped together).

I get that the fire mage looks more like it did in VT1, but VT1 doesn't even have a fraction of the enemies that VT2 has so staff-uptime is pretty important. Also, VT1 had that bolt staff that could lock on enemies 1-hitting a SV."

How's your social media presence? Any drunken or naked pics on your Facebook profile? Employers use social media as a reference too. Might want to make your accounts private. I've turned away potential recruiters for having indecent pics on their profile and Linkedin pages.

If you are looking for government specific work -- it's going to get tougher closer to elections. Things tend to slow down. Especially given that this is a provincial election and no one knows what's going to happen post May.

maybe have someone look at your resume? it could be that you worked with someone who had a poor reputation, or high turn over or you aren't applying for jobs that you are qualified for. Revamp your resume and add details to match each job you apply for. If they ask for a cover letter, include a well written one that highlights your skills. Maybe your resume is too long - or too short.

Also make sure you are following their instructions for applying. Companies do this for a reason to weed out those who don't follow instructions. It could be as simple as not naming your resume correctly or sending to the wrong address.

More often than not - companies already have someone internal lined up but they still have to go through the hiring process of reviewing resumes and interviewing to make it legal.

"Ma'am,

First, I am very sorry that you're in this situation.  This is difficult, for many reasons.  No, I don't pretend to know you, know you're husband, but bear with me.

I don't think you should be trying to seduce your husband right now.  I'd come at the problem from a different vantage point than that.

Many men are problem solvers.  I'm assuming he loves you, loves his family etc.  If there were a problem with one of your children or a problem where he works, he'd dig into it, work on resolving it etc.

Well, you are his wife, his lover, the mother of his children.  I'd suggest talking to him (not in the bedroom, maybe on a walk or just outside in the yard) and letting him know that you look forward to the rest of your lives together and that you want break out of the doldrums.  4 children, bills, jobs all have a way of simply taking over one's lives.

People need to be intentional with things they do otherwise inertia takes over and it's like one just begins to go through the motions.

I can't imagine that if he genuinely knows that the woman he loves, the woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with is unhappy, has a problem that he won't try to address it, work on it etc.

There are many ways to compromise in life, at work and in a marriage.  There are things he likes and wants and there are things you like and want.  Sadly, none of us get everything we want in life.  But from what you've written, it seems like he is getting his way much more often than you are in terms of sexual intimacy with him.

I wish I could tell you that it would all work out.  It very well might and it might not.

I am a strong proponent of trying, of changing things up, of peeling back the layers of the onion.  I don't like when one simply says ""I'm trying"".  What are they trying exactly?  I'd have a piece of paper and I'd write it down, create an action plan etc. but that's just me.  You have to do you.

Why do things need to be changed up?  You're slowly dying on the vine.  You're withering away.

You already feel down, depressed, sad etc.  But, the way you feel now will feel much worse a year from now with no change.  It will feel much worse two years from now.

Changing things up might need lead to the result you want, but remaining in the status quo won't lead to the change you want either.

So, your choices are to do nothing and hope for improvement or you may be intentional in trying break out of the doldrums.  Is it easy?  No, it isn't and there are no guarantees.

As for me, I'd rather go down swinging, while having a chance than sitting there and doing nothing.

Nicely let him know you love him, desire him and that you want him to try and meet you in the middle, to compromise.  Ask him if he wants to do that, if he's willing to do that, if he will do that.

You know him, I don't.  Will he just reflexively say I will, of course I will honey and then do nothing?

If you know he responds this way or has in the past, gently ask him to stop and think for a moment before responding to you when you ask him if he'll try to meet you in the middle, to improve things.

&amp;#x200B;

People have to choose to remain in love with their partners.  If they don't, life becomes stale very quickly and they just go through the motions.

It's apparent that you WANT to shake free of the current status quo so you should be willing to to try and engage in things to do just that, shake things up, break the two of you out of the current status quo.

Does he work too long?  Is he stressed?  If so, talk to him, ask him for ideas to change some things up so he'll have less stress.  Offer some ideas to him.  Many people become overwhelmed and they think a problem is too big so they don't even begin to tackle it.

I say just take one bite at a time.  You don't have to eat it all at once.  Just make one small change each week and before long things will be much different.

Or don't make any changes and remain in the status quo.  I don't think you should do that.

So, die on the vine while slowly withering away or fight to make changes.

Come at it from the perspective of love, of wanting to be happy and vibrant, of wanting to sit together with him on a porch swing when you're both in your 70's while watching your grandkids playing in the yard.

Let him know that you intend to fight for your happiness (his and yours as a couple I mean).

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck."

Series 1 and series 5 are good places to look. 

For series 1, the first 5 episodes weren't great. There were a lot of flaws there. But Dalek is a great episode. Only to be immediately followed by The Long Game, which was awful. Series 1 didn't get going until its final stretch. 

Series 5, however, got into its groove in its 4th episode. The Weeping Angels two parter got the season in its groove, with Vampires of Venice being the only subpar episode after that. 

Now, how long will it take series 11 to get into its groove? When will the series get its first great episode? It's hard to say. Some would argue that Rosa was great. But I have watched some shows that I didn't really get into until the season finale. "

"No I think plenty of builds can achieve 2k 

But very few people are going to bother because .. why?

It's such a big grind that most people couldn't achieve even if they had a good build with infinite currency at this point in the league. It's not that their build can't do 2k, it's that it's too deep they don't have the time to get there. The people who are at 2k currently most likely multibox for sulphite (I know havoc did), and play over 15 hours daily. That's just not possible for 99.9% of the playerbase.

Firstly... The health insurance and dental is ONLY free if your active duty. If your reserve or national guard (I recommend reserve) then they provide TRS (Tricare Reserve Select) which is like 47$ a month or something. I forget... they keep lowering it. It use to be like 49$ a month but any who... the dental is 11$ and some odd cents. I recommend going air force but you will need to score a high enough ASVAB. (It's a simple test that you take during MEPS and MEPS is basically in processing into the military)

Not going to lie, there are MANY benefits to joining the army. One which includes GI Bill which paying up to I believe 3.3k in tuition if memory recalls. Plus there's TA (tuition assistance) which helps pays for school books but that one you HAVE to not be flagged for. Flagged meaning not doing annual medical, dental, and not passing PT exam. (PT = 2 mile run. 2 min push up. 2 min sit up) ALSO if deployed or did i forget how many years of active duty... but if certain requirements were met you can be eligible for Post 911 which replaces GI Bill but provides more $$ for tuition. Also even if you don't use the GI Bill or Post 911 as long as you do at LEAST i believe 4 years you can pass it along to the kids.

Joining the reserve or national guard would allow you to still do full time job or full time schooling, etc. They normally only drill two times a month and they majority of the time will be on weekends. There is an AT (annual training) that lasts normally 2 weeks but all these ""drills"" will get you exempt from work and they pay well. Plus military experience is great for resume. Businesses get benefits for hiring military personal and military experience is now starting to be seen as work experience too. Example; if you work in the finance section in the air force for 4 years. It's considered 4 years in finance in civilian work related field too.

BUT PLEASE DO KEEP IN MIND. Joining the military means that you are agreeing to be deployed and that you are willing to fight for the USA and be an american soldier. Most people will get deployed at least once in their life during a 6 by 2 contract (total of 8 year contract) There are instances where you don't but don't go in with the mindset of not being deployed.

The reason I recommend reserve than National guard is because in the national guard contract (I don't know if it's in all NG contract) you can't move to a different state. The moment you do move to a different state before your contract ends you have to pay back the GI Bill that was provided and any bonuses given. Plus the Guard is state wide so their funding is a lot lower than the reserves where it's not state wide. The pay is the same but for example AT in the Guard is usually transportation via driving in homvee while AT in reserves is usually transportation via air planes.

Hope this helps. If you have any additional questions shoot away."

"Before I go on, I want to say that you countering my points is perfectly fine. There's no need to worry about disagreeing with my opinions. These types of discussions are fun.

&gt; What I see there is a diatribe about evil, not necessarily a warning about physical danger. Karina's rant all boils down to one capability: Cutting the Colossals loose on the world.

I think it's more than that. Gabi seems to be under the impression that Reiner was subject to cruel and awful treatment during his 5 years spent on Paradis ([Chapter 94, pg 19](https://i.imgur.com/6ANn63g.jpg?1)). She believes that all of the people on the island are devils that lack any human decency. She was even ready to bash Kaya's head in with a rock as soon as they met her because she immediately perceives anyone there as a threat that would harm them simply because they are incapable of kindness and compassion. 

&gt; so why give the Paradis folks reason to cut loose with their ultimate weapon if it's possible to lay low and wait for rescue or a chance to escape? 

But that's the thing, going back to Gabi's argument with Falco in chapter 108 ([Here](https://imgur.com/a/GWtLFhB)), to me, this shows that Gabi has given up all hope of living for very much longer. But more importantly, she wants to die with her pride intact, which is why she refused to take off her armband. For her entire life, she has been fighting to prove to the world that she and the other Eldians in the internment zones are good people that the world can trust. But now she's lost her home, her friends, and she believes that soon she will lose her life. Her pride is the only thing she has left.

&gt; She's less feeling cornered and more doesn't give a f%# about her situation, therefore bye-bye self-preservation and hello familiar old feelings? That'd fit.

I think that it's both. Because she feels like she is cornered, she's lost all fucks to give. Like I mentioned in my earlier point, she's lost everything, even her hope for survival. All that she has left is her pride, and as a ""virtuous Eldian"", she's going to let those devils know what's what if they speak out of line.

&gt; I think I may be misunderstanding you here, but: Wouldn't laying low and trying to blend in be the best way to ""trick them"" and ""catch them off guard""?

Yeah, it looks like I may not have worded that in the best way. I was talking about Kaya. Gabi believed that Kaya was trying to trick them into letting their guards down so that they could do awful things to them, like the ""devils"" they are."

"Italian used to be considered ""not white enough"" by WASPs in American history. Same with Irish, because they were the wrong type of Christian (Catholic) and were considered lazy, dirty, bringing foreign ideologies (anarchism and Catholicism, look up Sacco and Vinzetti). They weren't treated like black or Hispanics but they were at the bottom of the white totem pole and were targeted by the Klan in places with negligible black presence. Their was a short lived political party that sought an end of immigration from Italy and Ireland, called colloquially as the Know Nothings.

There is a reason Columbus day is a holiday, it was originally an attempt to shove Italians into the American foundational myth and thus be more acceptable to other whites. They were white but not white enough to be let into country clubs, private schools, or marry into for a segment of the White American population. Again no where near other oppression in the USA, but they weren't assimilated whites for generations after landing. "

"My mistake, the term and idea of the multidisciplined specialist, ""the criminalist"" is not found much anymore. These days a criminalist specializes in one or a few specific types of analysis: questioned documents, firearms and toolmarks, hair and fiber, etc.  One who does all isn't what  is looked for so much anymore.  So if you're looking for jobs and you search ""criminalist"" you might not find what you're actually looking for, but if you search for a forensic specialty you have a better shot.

Since op was inquiring as to what degrees would be useful in undergraduate studies, a hard science would be best especially at a school with no forensic science program.  

It's also possible that my professors and advisors made a mistake in saying that ""the criminalist"" was a disappearing breed of forensic scientist.  It's also very possible that I'm an idiot."

"I think for that one it got to the point where even they couldn't deny it. You'll notice that there are quite a few arguments that seem to have died in the past couple years, presumably in response to people debunking it.

So to answer your question, there's a couple reasons. For one, the re was a very good reason for that hole to be there. They create the hole when they put the blood in. They also knew who broke the evidence tape around it, it was when they tested his DNA to exonerate him in the rape case. So the defense at the original trial didn't even use it in court, it was just MaM being incredibly dishonest.

The other reason is the EDTA test. When you have blood in a vial like that you have to put a preservative in it to prevent it from clotting. The preservative is called EDTA. So by testing the blood left at the crime scene they can tell if it came from the tube. They found no EDTA, so it had to come from Avery's body directly. That's why Zellner is forced to propose that ridiculous ""blood from the sink"" theory."

Granted the regime are idiots and are just going to fund terrorism anyway, however they could become integrated with the world economic system, including establishing deals with russia and other enemies, develop knowledge of nuclear technology, and know exactly what to expect in 15 years so if they waaaanted to develop weapons it would be so much easier for them."

Thats the capital in capitalism.  401ks, IRAs, mutual funds, etfs are all a product of capitalism. You can consume your income/wealth or you can invest it.

The broadly based accountability of people is going to drive better results than the gov't directed control of industry, call it fascism, communism, or socialism. If it were up to me companies would have ESOPs built into them and primarily be owned by vested employees, but I'll take current model. "

Excessive Lethargy. If sleeping pills are used intentionally, it will put people to sleep. Users of these drugs use the medication a lot often and must be able to differentiate the normal sleepiness from something else.
Breathing Irregularities. Overdose victim of sleeping pills might exhibit dysfunctional or slow breathing. This must be monitored the closest of all. You can administer life-saving CPR once breathing ceases or once consciousness is lost.
Abdominal Pain. It is possible that appetite loss or constipation could happen. And this is considered as the most infrequent symptom when it comes to sleeping pills overdose.

Forget the Pentagon, whats going to stop the Military is the NCO dance.  Reality dictates that it won't actually  do anything to stop the Military Industrial Complex and does fuck all for you ever getting a large subset of the population from ever voting left.

"Trying to explain it will just make it worse. You will never be able to get through to these people. They just aren't on your frequency. They are emotionally driven. Logic and emotion are almost always in direct conflict. What few people ever realize is that 9 times out of 10 the positives are the first thing on the table, and only thing on the table. 

Everybody loves to throw out positives, while *completely ignoring the negatives.* 

You point out the obvious and they call *you* negative. I get this all the time. ""You're a pessimist."" ""You're negative."" ""Blah blah blah, glass half full.""

I slammed into the door, busted the latch, and then nailed the brick wall on the other side.  Busted my nose.

"Here it is! The most disingenuous post on this sub. I knew this echo chamber was bad but, this is just downright shameful. Saying we have a ""right wing"" terrorism problem when GOP senators and congressman have been shot on baseball fields, harassed and screamed at dinner, mocked and ridiculed online and social media. Not a single one of your messiah Democrats condemned these attacks but, were quick to turn the narrative against Trump (surprise surprise.) The fact this has been upvoted so many times shows it's pointless to try and debate so just shut up and listen. While myself and fellow Trump supporters would defend you from being assaulted, you would not say the same about us. Trump condemned and called for unity EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THE BOMBS WENT OFF. No democrat was injured and yet, here you all are screaming we have a terrorist problem. We definitely have a domestic terrorism problem and it's being caused by Antifa/White supremacists. Nobody is taking you seriously. Nobody cares who you want to blame. Facts and reason will prevail as will the GOP in the next few weeks. I encourage you to downvote this, which will only confirm what everyone already knows about this sub. "

"&gt;In other words, having total adoration for one (dogs) and having near indifference for another (pigs) shows an inconsistency in morality given that there are no morally significant differences between the two.

I've struggled with this thought before - that I care more about dogs in particular over other animals - and I do think there is some kind of significant difference, in that dogs have been living with us as companions and we have been evolving together for literally tens of thousands of years. They are our friends and companions - they have an instinctual love for us, and most humans have an instinctual love for dogs back. 

I feel like if you think that at least there is no logical inconsistency with the fact that most humans care more about other humans than animals, that there it should at least be within the realm of reason that there might be no logical inconsistency with caring more about dogs than other animals; we have an instinctual bond with them because they have been our companions since before human civilization, before hunting and gathering gave way to agriculture. We care about their suffering more because they are our friends.

That being said, I also care about pigs, cows, sheep, etc.. Just not as much as dogs. Just like I care about you, but not as much as my wife."

"Standard form of a parabola is (x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k). The focus is (h, k+p) and the directrix is x= h-p. So for your equation we need to move he 1 over to the y side, and we’ll get y-1= (x-4)^2. With that, we can change the left side to 1(y-1) so it better fits the model. We can now determine the focus. The H in the equation is 4, the k is 1, and the p would be 1/4 ( b/c in 4p=1, p=1/4). So the focus would be (4,5/4). Then the directrix would be x=4-1/4, which is 3 and 3/4. "

* R7 2700X is the best AMD offers for gaming
* 16 GB DDR4-3200
* Combo of the best value Samsung Evo SSD and fantastic value Seagate 3 TB HDD
* GTX 1080 Ti, I know this won't take advantage of Freesync but quite frankly you won't need Freesync with this thing
* IMO a really cool looking green and black tempered glass case
* Excellent PSU

Here's an i7-8700k build that will perform even better, but more expensive:

That build would be a beast in the short term, but one caveat: as AMD's Ryzen line moves up in generations, you won't have to replace the motherboard, but with Intel, you will almost definitely have to replace the motherboard if you want to upgrade your CPU in the future. Just something to think about."
They are already starting: http://magaimg.net/img/6jox.png
I feel like most women feel this way about autumn 
I almost bought a vintage citronaut hat from eBay. One of you other bastards must have got it
"Let's back up for a second and consider WHY the BSM mis-prices options. Then we'll get closer to why the traditional put-call parity method doesn't apply as strictly as people like to think it does.

&amp;#x200B;

The BSM assumes a risk-neutral framework. Risk-neutral means that you would be indifferent between two choices, given that they have the same cash flows. There's a huge amount of theory here (which I'd encourage you to explore), but the gist is that you can replicate the payoff of a security (e.g. stocks) by combining a risk-free instrument (e.g. US bonds) and another instrument (e.g. an option). If the payoffs don't match, then an arbitrage opportunity exists. So how do you know how to price the option? According to the Black Scholes model, you plug in the volatility assumption, use a log-normal model for the returns, and back into the option price.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings us to: **C + PV(x) = P + S**, which is the Black-Scholes risk-neutral put/call parity equation.

&amp;#x200B;

This basically tells us that *given* a certain (correct) volatility, the distribution of stock returns should be normally distributed around the forward price. But what if stock returns *aren't* normally distributed? What if there's fat tails on the downside? What if the majority of the time, stocks go up? What if stocks tend to go down faster than stocks go up? How do you capture this aspect of reality in a model that forces you to assume symmetric stock returns? 

&amp;#x200B;

This is how vol skew happens. Whether you realize it or not, the implied volatility you're quoted by your broker should be footnoted with ""black-scholes implied volatility"", because that's the only model which makes that price work. What if the market's forecast assumptions for the stock have a greater probability of upside than downside? That's not reflected in the ATM measure of volatility, because you can't bifurcate upside vs downside in a single symmetric measure.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately what you end up with is a model with unrealistic assumptions and a simplifying ""best guess"" at what the actual growth rate should be in order to make the math work. Knowing this, a reasonable person would find that using the ATM Black-Scholes implied volatility for all options chronically under-prices call options and overprices put options during periods of growth (for reference, SPX has grown at an 8% clip since inception). Hence the need for a volatility surface (implied vols at each strike and expiration), which allows for these assumptions, unlike the BSM.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't surprise me that you found ATM calls were underpriced and ATM puts were overpriced (using a theoretical BSM price or other lognormal model), since the market goes up on average. It also doesn't surprise me that, in hindsight, using implied volatilies don't reflect the actual price moves of the underlying, therefore most options are mispriced. So the major takeaway is to understand what the parameters you're using actually mean, how to apply them, and know when they break. In this case, you're basically discovering that the BSM only works in textbooks, and a better, more accurate model of put/call parity is needed."

"I’ve had some luck with precedex on patients with pretty bad pump head post operatively, and when used in conjunction with fentanyl I’ve seen pretty good sedation. But I did a small bolus of precedex once and I will never make that mistake again 😰"
"I really like Wendy’s design. Thematically, playing a scrappy orphan who saves the world is really fun. Mechanically, Wendy poses interesting challenges and tests player skill. Her ability causes a lot of interesting decisions (is this worth a redraw? What card to pitch?), as does her unique asset. Both of them are pretty strong.

Wendy is an excellent solo investigator, but I don’t consider her particularly great in high-level multiplayer, which is the format I tend to play these days. Her ability is good, but her stat line and card pool hold her back. 1 Combat / 3 Intellect is a tough combo and makes it relatively difficult for Wendy to advance the Act deck. The Survivor/Rogue card pool is not the best for that either.

Of course, Wendy does have some tricks to leverage her stats better, e.g. Lockpicks. I’m not saying she’s hopeless. But I think it is difficult to play Wendy in a 3 or 4 player Expert game and really feel like you’re pulling your weight on the team. That’s been my experience. 

That said, her strong theme and interesting gameplay make her really fun, and I think Wendy is probably my second most-played investigator out of all of them."

"The original purpose of the Guildhests was to teach you ""basic mechanics.""

**#1** - how to make specific pulls from mobs that don't link, and how to handle mobs that do link.
**#2** - how to handle adds spawning during the fight. (sadly, the fight is so easy you can ignore the adds, so this doesn't work, and tanks don't learn.)  
**#3** - how to have patience when the dungeon is throwing you at forced wall after forced wall and piecemeal pulls, and how to ""throw the lever.""  
**#4** - some mobs have special mechanics! don't kill the turtle! **Stop! Don't kill the fucking tur--**

#DUTY FAILED

**#5** - how not to stand in bad stuff. Don't worry, that's the healer's job.  
**#6** - how to handle waves of adds while keeping damage up on the boss. The only problem is there is no punishment for not keeping damage up on the boss.  
**#7** - how to handle diverse debuffs *while* adds spawn at the end. Sometimes, focusing the boss instead is more important than the adds.  
**#8** - how to stop certain mechanics from actually happening. Focusing the boss at one point, but really, it's killing the balls.  
**#9** - how some fights have area effects that influence the fight, and how to stage them and stagger their influence.  
**#10** - how to pay attention to your area while dealing with the boss. Can you avoid an aoe that you can't see? It's about moving around the battlefield. Tank doesn't move and more often, the healer has to heal everything.  
**#11** - how to handle frustration when the healer doesn't use Esuna, how to recognize that different mobs have unique mechanics.  
**#12** - how to read. Literally. That's all it is.  
**#13** - there are THREE bosses! ... a boss gauntlet, with 8 people! You can practically solo this.

Now, there are certain types of mechanics that are fairly commonplace in new content, which likely deserve some special content to express how to deal with them. But some of these show up in the level 15 series of training hall effects. What remains are all the other effects that we now see that are problematic and difficult to teach, because people are prideful."

The only thing that gets me is her saying his name before he starts taking off towards him and sounding almost.. hesitant/nervous/anxious but not in a distraught way.

I'm trying to list out the usages. I'm not prescribing what they can and can't use. Correct me if I'm wrong. Tell me if I've missed any. 

Here are examples:

 1. (to mean confidence) I have faith that my wife will be home tonight.

 2. (As evidence) I take it on faith that the accounts of jesus coming back to life are true.

 3. (to mean religion) My faith is that of christianity.

Tell me which one of these is incorrect in that no theist has ever said it, or that I've mis-categorized it."

"I can’t disagree with you. But it’s meant to just explain why it’s so frustrating to some of us that they changed this in the way that they did. That’s ultimately all my point was.

It’s hard not to make it sound like a bigger deal than I think it really is. I feel strongly in my negative perception of the situation but I know it’s not like the end of the world. But for a platform that I’ve spent a lot of time on, invested plenty of time into, it’s just a let down for it to have turned out this way.

If I’m not watching as much of it for this reason, then there are definitely others. I don’t know numbers so I won’t begin to presume how many, but that’s still people moving away from Twitch. I’ve read that several times. That’s one less person willing to explore for new streams for each person who doesn’t like the ads they now have to deal with. That’s a lost opportunity for those small streamers because less people are looking for them. A loss of a potential viewer is hard to quantify as a streamer since you didn’t know them in the first place. But it doesn’t mean it isn’t a lower number of people that might come across your stream.

I only watch people I’ve already followed at this point and don’t search for new streamers on Twitch. Judging by others comments I’ve heard since this announcement I’m not the only one.

Edit: I am very long-winded today. I apologize for the lengths of these comments. Especially the last one."

"Here's what it said:

&gt; Every fan down in Smashville liked hype a lot…

&gt;But the Grinch, who lived somewhere in France, DID NOT!

&gt;The Grinch hated hype-ing! The whole pre-release season!

&gt;Now please don’t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.

​

It could be he was sick of all the fake leaks.

It could be, perhaps, he could not wait 6 weeks.

But I think that the most likely reason of all,

Was he knew Verg’s roster was two sizes too small.

​

Whatever the reason, the size or the wait,

He stood there on Wednesday, ready for hate.

Staring down at the banner with a sour, Grinchy frown,

At unreleased characters – shit’s about to go down.

​

For he knew every fan down in Smashville online,

Were caught in a drought, just passing the time.

“And they’re talking about Skull Kid!” He snarled with a sneer,

“Next month is Ultimate! It’s practically here!”

​

Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously humming,

“I must tell them somehow, they won’t see it coming!”

For each day he knew all the smash boys and smash girls,

Would cling to new leaks, it might make him hurl.

​

And then! Oh, the posts! Oh, the posts!

Posts! Posts! Posts!

That’s one thing he hated! The posts!

POSTS! POSTS! POSTS!

​

Then the fans young and old would talk and they’d guess.

And they’d guess! And they’d guess! And they’d GUESS!

GUESS! GUESS! GUESS!

​

They would guess there’d be Waddle Dee, and Minecraft’s own Steve.

Which was something the Grinch couldn’t stand to conceive.

And then they’d do something he liked least of all!

Every fan down in Smashville, the tall and the small,

​

Would all come together, like fish on a string.

Having taken the bait, oh to the threads they would cling!

His phone would ding! It would ding! It would Ding!

DING! DING! DING!

​

And the more the Grinch listened to his phone go ring ding,

The more the Grinch thought, “I must stop this whole thing!”

“Why, for 231 days I’ve put up with it now!”

“I must stop these fake leaks from coming! But how?”

​

Then he got an idea! An awful idea!

THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFULLY AWFUL IDEA!

“I know just what to do!” The Grinch laughed in his throat.

And he broke out his laptop and started to gloat.

​

And he chuckled, and clucked, “What a great Grinchy trick!”

“With this promo poster I have, they’ll know it’s legit!”

“All I need is a platform…” The grinch searched around.

But since the fanbase is large, no new ones were found.

​

Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply yelled,

“If they can post on 4 chan, I’ll make one myself!”

So he took out a pan and took up a pad,

He wrote, and he wrote, the fans won’t be had!

​

Then he added some cuses and some deconfirms too,

“There’s no new playable Pokemon, oh no, boo hoo.”

Then the Grinch yelled “It’s done!” and so he clicked,

It was posted online, but soon he was ticked.

​

The board remained dark. Quiet posts filled the air.

All the fans disregarded his post without care.

He read the replies, of which their were few,

“This leak is fake! This guy has no clue!”

​

He stared at the screen, clenching his fist.

Translating from French to English was hardly a synch.

He needed hard evidence, that much was clear.

But a photo? Too easily faked was his fear.

​

He thought and he thunk, about what he should do.

A video might cost him his job, that much was true.

“These characters,” he grinned, “the public must know!”

He knew it was time to put on a show.

​

He looked round the room, to make sure none could hear,

And he took out his phone, with much newfound cheer.

“And now!” grinned the Grinch “I’ll put them in a slum!”

He took out his phone, then took out his thumb.

​

He was swiping through apps, to decide what to use,

When he heard a loud sound, like the honk of a goose.

He turned around fast, and he saw the night-watchman,

It was Jack, oh how he hated this Scotsman.

​

The Grinch had been caught by this large man of honor,

Who’d seen the light left on, but the Grinch was no goner.

He started at the Grinch and barked, “Oh Eric, why,”

“Why are you taking pics of this banner? WHY?”

​

But you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,

He thought up a lie and he thought it up quick!

“Why my sweet old friend Jack,” the Grinchy Eric lied,

“There was a rip in this banner messing it up on one side!”

​

“So I was asked to stay late and fix it, my dear.”

“I’m texting the boss about the new one right here.”

And his fib fooled the watchman. Then the Grinch shook his head,

“You’re keeping me from my work,” he said.

​

And when Jack the Scotsman went away in a huff,

The Grinch took out his phone and loaded it up!

He lined up the evidence onto a desk,

Opened up snapchat, and thought of something grotesque.

​

He started recording the leak right there with his phone,

Writing “fuck you Nintendo lolllll” now all would be known!

He sent it along waiting for a response,

Someone screen-grabbed his snap with no nonchalance.

​

It was a quarter past midnight, some fans still in beds,

With dreams of Shantae and Elma in heads.

The Grinch he just sat, he sat, and waited.

Happy with the silence he had soon created.

​

Safe and anonymous, thanks to snapchat,

He’d surely put an end to speculation chitchat.

“PoohPooh to the fans!” he was Grinchishly humming.

“They’re finding out now no more surprises are coming!”

​

“They’re just waking up! I know what they’ll do!”

“Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,

Then the fans down in Smashville will all cry boohoo!”

“That’s a noise,” Grinned the Grinch, “That I simply MUST hear!”

So he paused. And the Grinch refreshed pages with cheer.

​

And he did read some words, flooding into the site.

It started out light, then his eyes widened in fright.

The words aren’t sad! Why, they sounded merry!

It couldn’t be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!

​

He stared down at Smashville and the Grinch popped his eyes!

To his core he shook, what he read was a shocking surprise!

Every fan down in Smashville, both casual and hardcore,

Were cheering and cheering! With no surprises in store!

​

He hadn’t stopped leaks from coming, they came!

What’s worse, he found out, they'd discovered his name!

And the Grinch, with his grinch-ears ringing with dinging,

Stood puzzling, and puzzling, “To what are they clinging?”

​

“It came without Directs! Without trailer posts!

It came without Sakurai, Reggi, or treehouse live hosts!”

And he puzzled and puzzled, till his puzzler was sore.

Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn’t before!

​

“Maybe hyping” he thought, “Doesn’t come from fake leaks.”

“Maybe hyping… perhaps… isn’t something so meek!”

And what happened then? Well in Smashville they say,

Smash Ultimate’s roster grew three sizes that day.

​

And the minute that Sakurai got word of the leak,

The cheers of his fans kept it from ruining his week.

The leaks they had come, but it hadn’t mattered.

The people were happy, and their hopes were untattered.

​

The trailers now could confirm restored hopes and new hype,

Hype that would keep ringing and dinging each night.﻿

The only thing that makes this story smell weird is the fact that she saw the videos as supportive of JP, but then again, I'm always amazed at the level of sensitivity of some people. Sometimes there's outrage for touching on a sensible topic without being as explicitly against something as they would like (think Ezra scolding Sam for talking about race without spending enough time reminding everyone that blacks have been mistreated, even if it's out of context)"

I think the DNS solution is sufficient ""evidence"" if they're up to nefarious tasks. Most stuff is HTTPs already which means the data you collect about specific pages visited will be garbage and further than that things like facebook and whatever will require a log-in from their account to see properly anyway (ignoring the https issue). I don't think the data you're hoping to collect will really be available to you without a keylogger on their machine.

With DNS stuff you can already see if kiddies are visiting porn or 4chan. I don't understand where seeing the difference between them going to 4chan /b or /a seems moot to me.

I still think netflow will be your best bet for what you want, but syslog isn't really the answer.

"&gt;will have to pay tax for both traditional and Roth on the gains, correct?

No,and this is precisely why you would typically not want to just do the first step of backdoor Roth (contribute nondeductibly to trad IRA) and leave it there, because growth would be taxed. Better is to do the second step (convert to Roth) so growth happens in Roth, never taxed.

Maybe another question is: Why do backdoor Roth at all (since you lock in taxes at today's rate)? Why not just invest in a taxable brokerage account, paying tax on dividends and capital gains?"

"You can call anything terrorism. ""Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror among masses of people; or fear to achieve a financial, political, religious or ideological aim.""

It's not productive to the class' discussion about what is going on and doesn't benefit anyone or anything but your already inflated ego. I applaud Jeremy because he wants to learn and asks clarifying and thought provoking questions while you ask questions that the professor does not care about and the rest of the class cannot understand. How about you take criticism like an adult instead of telling the teacher like you're still in grade school?

what are you talking about??
"I think one true test of character is what they do with ""lost"" money. Or better, when they are in a position where they could ""steal"" something or at least ""keep something"" without being caught. Some examples. 

I had a boss at a small corner store. An older lady came in and ended up leaving her envelope full of cash in the parking lot. Me and the manager BOTH know our outside cams only view the entrance and sidewalk. The envelope was outside of it's radius and I was inside when he found it. 

3k was inside. He could have EASILY pocketed it as he was going home for the night. No one would have known. He wouldn't have been a suspect (or at least no proof). No one would have accused him or anything. Yet he brought it back in and told me about it then put it in the safe. I think knowing he chose to return it to the customer shows his moral fiber and how good of a person he was. 

In the same vein but less cash. I've been with friends who found a lost wallet. Sometimes it's outside a party or bar or something where there's no cams or anything. I've seen people pick a wallet up and look for identification in it. See cash in the wallet and instead of touching it, they try to return the wallet in tact. They could easily snatch the cash then try to return it and say they found it that way. Or just grab cash and leave the wallet. But every time I've been with people and we find wallets or purses or something. It's always returned or turned into security or something. 

Even down to seeing someone else drop a 20$, I've seen people pick it up and fast walk up to the person who dropped it and hand it back. It's JUST 20$, but still. I think people who return money or items when they have a chance to keep it for themselves shows a LOT of character. 

And I can confidently say that because I know I'd be struggling to decide whether I should return the money or just keep it. It wouldn't be a knee jerk reaction like I've seen from other people I know are good. "

So unless Horde have a chance of just having *zero* alliance players in their shard, any imbalance is going to be matched across the shards."

"There’s definitely nothing wrong with politely requesting food, especially if you’ve been there all day and haven’t eaten! In my case, I just don’t ask for it because I can manage with my husband running to get me something, and if he’s there and able to help me, I don’t want to take up too much of the nurse’s time. 

You’re definitely right, your attitude has a lot to do with how you are treated. There’s a big difference between someone making polite, reasonable requests, and someone barking ridiculous demands. It pisses me off when I see people with very minor medical issues being rude and making unreasonable demands, yet I am usually there with quite serious concerns (although I realize I’m still not the sickest person there by far, thankfully), and I still make a huge effort to treat the nurses, techs, and doctors with kindness and respect, even when I am in agony. And even when they don’t show the same level of kindness towards me, I try to be understanding. Healthcare is an incredibly stressful job, and I never know what they could be doing in another patient’s room right before they enter mine, which could be causing them worry and distress. 

Anyway, I hope your health issues improve and you don’t have to spend too much time in the hospital in the upcoming year! Good luck to you :)

"""make some money"" = ""strippers see you as money."" You two aren't really disagreeing. Some strippers don't enjoy their jobs and do it because they don't have better options that pay as much.

"The LNP can't be trusted to look after our international reputation.

Under Howard we became George W Bush's ""Deputy Sherriff"" in Pacific then the racist nasty country where we bugged the neighbours we publicly pretended to help with new Independence, while secretly screwing them of their maritime boundaries.

We sent special forces into ship in international waters to force them to turn refugees they'd picked up away from Australia.

We tore down our own unique rainforest in a National Park on Christmas Island to build prison camps in the jungle.

Abbott made a fool of himself threatening to shirt-front Putin and pissed off Indonesia with reports leaking that we were bugging the President and his family. 

Now this useless government is reducing foreign aid to Pacific Island nations while trying to bully them to not turn to Chinese help.

We're running puppet govts in PNG and Nauru who we tell who to issue visas to and who to deport. 

Our newest and worst environment minister told ex President of Kiribati to go fuck himself in public in a restaurant in Canberra (while shoving taxpayer funded food into her fat maw).

ScoMo has pissed off our best neighbour, Indonesia with his latest brain-fart Israel embassy move. 

Contrast this to ALP, where in the 1990s Keating set up Australia for engagement and closer ties with Asia and the Pacific.

Keating even wrote a book on closer engagement with Asia Pacific, showing how being a good citizen = better economic ties.

At this rate, with LNP's inept hands on the wheel, we'll be locked out of all Asia Pacific cooperation and engagement for decades. "

"I'm quite confident if you add up all the sex chromosome disorders it's going to be +.1% of the population (Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome should be sufficient alone). Besides, as someone in a professional healthcare program I know myself and my peers are more than mentally capable of understanding more than two sexes - and furthermore this is information that would be relevant to our work in some cases. Categorizing someone as male or female when they have a sex chromosome disorder is incorrect and can potentially reduce patient outcomes (ex. changes to dosing might be required for optimal outcomes). There is no need for binary definitions and there are consequences to such restrictive definitions."

"It's not so much a problem with gender specifically, in my opinion, as it is with language combined with hangups people tend to have when things challenge culture and tradition. I'm speaking, for the record, as a layperson.

Words are not limited to their denotation, but also have connotation. Normally, connotation includes more information that denotation, as is seen with the negative, clinical tones taken on by the word *homosexual*. Gender seems to be the reverse, I suspect this has to do with how strictly gender roles were enforced for people who were not readily recognizable as being other than the male/female binary.

How are the joints?
"My problem isn’t that it’s they listen to jazz and classical. It’s that they ONLY listen to jazz and classical. What do Wesley and his friends listen to? See, that’s world building that has a gap. The fact they somehow only like jazz and classical makes the show flee dated. If they had classical why don’t they have their own classical as we do now? Classical music is still being made. You can have classical and still not fall into a glorification of the past. Here we are in the future and these people listen to the same music I do? It’s immersion breaking and just isn’t believable. "

I can't share my opinions with anyone without worrying if i'm going to get fired for my opinions. I can't speak without fear of being ridiculed. My beliefs are not radical, they are only made to seem radical by people who do not care about truth.

I don't go around calling people cunts, especially my gay and lesbian friends. I don't mock my girlfriend while I hold her hand when she has a temporary ""pride"" tattoo on her face while wearing rainbow flip flops. I watched Gigi Gorgeous videos with my ex girlfriend and have no issue with anyone being who they want to be. 

By all means though, it's just fine to do that to other people you don't know. As long as you don't understand them it's fine to label everyone that belongs to a group with stereotypes and ridicule them. Not only that, but you will be supported by all your friends who do the same thing. "

"pure capitalism, like any pure form of government or economic theory would not function in our complex society. a complex society needs a complex system of checks and balances and rules and incentives to maintain stability. 

Yes, in a pure capitalistic society like you said, why bother curing when you can just treat them and make more money.  So you are already suggesting that capitalism crushes any moral or ethical standards that people would have.  If even just some people had ethical standards that cared to help people, they could fund drug research and sell the cure for slightly less than what the immoral companies would sell the treatment for and make a nice profit and save lives.

But if we assume that every single person is purely capitalistic and would watch people die of curable diseases to make an extra buck, then why even bother with drug research?  build a nuke instead, mount in on a spire in the center of the country armed and ready to go off in 24 hours with emergency backup systems to trigger it if it detects being tampered with, and simply demand $100,000,000 be given to you every single day or else you do not enter the code to reset the counter back to 24 hours.  If everyone cared nothing about anything except making money then there are far more profitable means than building up a multi-billion dollar research industry to make only slightly effective drugs.

They hand you the copy and you think it's a copy of your Membership Record and they will not tell you any differently. The actual Membership Record may have notations on it that are not on the Ordinance Summary, especially if a member has been under church discipline or if something had to be handled by the Office of the First Presidency.

""The device that went to CNN’s offices **arrived by courier**, a law enforcement official said. However, it **still had half-a-dozen first-class postage stamps** on it.""

""A law enforcement official said the devices were made with a 1-inch-by-6-inch length of PVC pipe filled with suspected pyrotechnic powder and broken glass to serve as shrapnel. They had a small button battery with a digital clock as a timer and a hot bridge wire initiator, the official said.

The devices **contained some of the components that would be required** to build an operable bomb, but law enforcement officials **would not say late on Wednesday whether they were viable.**""

""Some **bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested that the bomb sent to CNN had hallmarks of fake explosives** — the kind more typically depicted on television and in movies, rather than devices capable of detonating.

A digital clock was taped to the middle of the pipe, a feature that experts say is typically shown on fictional bombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension, but unnecessary in real life."""

"I don't think that first come first served is a good way of determining truth value. That said, belief in the Christian God dates back way before the foundation of Christianity with the ancient Israelites and their ancestors, such as Abraham, Noah and Adam according to the Bible. In this sense a belief in the Christian God would have been first anyway. But that relies on a belief in the Bible, something that not everyone does.

I've been a Christian pretty much my whole life (what it means to be a Christian baby is questionable after all). But I've had my fair share of questions and doubts over the years. But there really isn't any reasoning I can give for my belief in the truth value of Christianity that most atheists or anti-theists don't normally respond with ""No, it isn't like that."". I believe there is evidence for Christianity; the existence of God, the death and resurrection of Christ, various other events described in the Bible. The text in the Bible makes philosophical sense to me and the more I learn about it the more eye opening it becomes. Not to mention I've also had myself a few personal experiences with God in my life. I'm not usually a very spiritual person so I can view these things as coincidences, but align with what I've been taught and what I've read in the Bible sufficiently enough that I consider them to be such experiences of God.

The difference between a belief in God of the Bible and any other religion is almost always going to be distinctly personal, because God of the Bible is a personal being."

"**Prediction of who might get 1-on-1 fights:**
* Carapace vs Gorizilla (the protectors)
* Cat Noir vs Riposte (the melee fighters)
* Rena Rouge vs Lila (the illusion castors)
* LB vs HM (the leaders)
* Queen Bee vs Catalyst (the fan girls who support/protecc the leaders)

The Owl vs Befana (the elders) [that'assuming befana was in range of the red akumas and will be in it at all)

**I really like the idea of getting the non akumatized students and former akuma villains involved so:**

1. Juleka vs Rose/Princess Fragrance

2. Totally agree on Luka vs Guitar Villain &amp; Frightingale, if not Kyle XY or the fanboy who was Pixelator.

3. D'Argentcourt (unless hes darkblade again) vs Riposte (unless she's fine, and didn't get revived)

4. Sabrina (as Robin/sidekick to Chloe) vs Catalyst/Natalie

**Not ALL of the former akuma villains got revived, so i decided not to think too much about who will fight whom until i see them all on screen to verify which side they fall on.**

*Allies who I havent thought of who to pair with:* most of Alya's family, Marinette's family, Alex's family (and their time powers), Robustus (who we *KNOW* can hack HM), and Ms. Bustier

*Confirmed Villains who I haven't thought about who to pair with:* The Mime, Time Breaker, Prime queen, Gamer, Dark Cupid, Stone heart, Horrificator, Gigantitan, T-Rex guy (Alya's dad/Animan), and Glaciator

I think maybe the people who originally caused their first akumatization and grew from that may volunteer, like the guy who tried to steal the lead from the Mime!

"I think grimore is just a friend (rs player), who is secretly a cross dresser that likes to wear lots of makeup and stream on an alt channel in his free time. He is really good at masking his Lithuanian accent, and whom both strangely share similar anime interests.

I also think he might be using a voice changer, as I notice similar effects can be emulated when you use a low pitch voice (like a grand mothers) with a high pitch irl voice that creates a similar voice to Grimoire. It also could explain why a friend, arguably youtubers #1 osrs video maker, doesn't stream on twitch as he's more occupied under the Grimoire cross dressing alt.

"I've only read the first few pages of Pollan's book. I was impressed with the amount of research he did for it, but I'm already familiar with virtually everything he writes. I do have a copy here on my shelf so I will check those pages soon. But I imagine he's merely mentioning all of the therapeutic research lost in the 50s and 60s, while I'm talking about the neurophenomenology. I have heard second hand that he relies almost exclusively on London's results for this.

The paper I linked you highlights some of the methodological issues with the current psychedelic research. 

This one by [Lewis (2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711736) more directly addresses the neuroimaging problems I'm talking about (and have been trying to solve for five years). In fact, Dr. Vollenweider personally sent this to me prior to publishing. 

For something more accessible, [here's a decent Scientific American article on it](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/misreporting-and-confirmation-bias-in-psychedelic-research/).

To give you a number I got to use a lv15 25SF mythic close PBA wand to match the dmg of a corsair with maxed legendary 18SF PBA gun in zak.

I'm worry about the dmg may fall too much behind since now every other class(included those already OP) received great buff. I hope the best but worry the worst.

Huh?
"“Below average” lol. The man was basically running our entire offense for the majority of his career with very little support. A lot of his bad decisions were at times when our defense was getting destroyed and he had to make some gambles to get back in the game. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose those situations. But he won a pretty damn good amount of them. That’s why he had so many fourth quarter comebacks. I’m not saying he hasn’t made some dumb throws, but even Tom Brady has made some very questionable throws at times. But Tom also had competent coaching and didn’t have to drag his heaping dead body of team for his entire career. “Below average” is such an ignorant statement. The reason he made it from an undrafted QB to the face of a franchise for a near decade, was because of his football IQ. He was definitely one of the smartest QBs in the game while he was playing. "

Calmly, I told him I had no sympathy for people in the oil industry (he never said he was, but my guess would be he was connected in some way). He continued to argue with me, so, calmly, I told him some people weren't willing to sell out their values for economic reasons. He straight up got out of the Lyft and said ""I'll walk"".

"What are those links supposed to prove exactly? 'Cause you've never really been clear about that and beyond, ""Oh, look, we had a disagreement in the forum."" there doesn't appear to be anything there.

&gt;Why not say, hey, I was wrong

What was I wrong about? I can concede the homophobic charge is further out there, though I still think the insult is grounded in oppressive power dynamics, specifically with regards to using femininity and relationship dynamics as indicators of inferiority.

You think you've answered all my questions? '[Cause](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/9gpn9m/_/e66bryh/) you haven't. Though, I'm sure you'll say *those* questions don't count.

Is that what you're on about?

&gt;I'll never say that kind of stuff again?

I will say that kind of stuff again when I think it's true. If I'm wrong, I'll admit that too. But, I won't skip saying something just because you think its wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You could link to it whenever I spam you, right?

Play shitty games, win shitty prizes. The copy paste agitates the forum and drives it off topic. It's neither persuasive nor effective. I don't have interest in this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And then you'd totally convince everyone you aren't a liar and a fraud.

That's not how it works. You can't prove a negative and no one need to disprove anything that hasn't been proven to begin with.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why is linking to you being honest for once a ""shitty tactic""?

If your links actually showed the things you claimed, I'd be much less objectionable.

"He saw something in the back seat that prompted him to get them out of the car and open the trunk. All I could see is a rope which I guess was left over from wrapping the body but should not look suspicion it and of itself. Probable cause to search a vehicle is a grey area. Cops can claim to smell something suspicious or that the driver or a passenger was acting sketchy. Depending on the judge, the search and anything found as a result may or may not be upheld. If the car doors were locked and windows down just enough to pass the license &amp; registration then the guys could demand a search warrant because the cop would physically not be able to remove them the car or open the truck (unless there's an external latch) without causing damage in view of the dash cam. Using such force is risky because if nothing's found the the cop could be fucked. "

"Yeah, so I can see how “quantum fluctuations” could theoretically create a universe out of “quantum nothingness” but (1) if this is the case, the extraordinary luck of it all might give you pause, but even if not, (2) quantum nothingness is not “absolute nothingness”.  The entire scientific framework used to arrive at that model needs to exist.  It might be as far back as we can go (we cannot easily test this, nor observe the universe from outside of the universe).  I find this utterly fascinating, but it unfortunately is not a persuasive philosophical revolution that disproves the need for something to act as a first cause, even if only to establish the quantum rules that are needed for the energy to fluctuate in such a way as to cause the Big Bang.

As I alluded to, these arguments always break down: your scientific proof is entirely sufficient to explain everything for you, and that’s great, but I still have plenty of questions that are metaphysical that science has not fully answered."

"Welcome to week 138 &amp; 139 of weekly Sinon!

I'm sorry I was late again this week. I've had a lot of stuff going on in my life; for example Raisin at my university, where over the course of 2 days I fully induct first year students that I adopted (my academic kids) into the university by playing (drinking) games with them in the morning of sunday, throwing them a party in the evening, and then dressing them up in costumes and sending them to a ~1000 person foam fight on monday morning. I really love my academic family and had an amazing time.

Sticking with the theme of family, I always headcanoned that Sinon would kinda 'adopt' Silica as a sort of sister in ALO because they are both Cait Siths. So for this week I've posted our favorite kitty pair.

I hope you all enjoy the two images and will kindly forgive me for messing up the schedule.

"Buy pieces of chicken (whether it's breast or thigh, drumsticks suck), preferably skin on. Bake at 375F skin side up. Assuming they're of average size (ie come off of a 3lb bird) it's 20 minutes for breast, 25 for bone-in thigh. After it's done take it out and let it rest on the baking sheet and you now have around 5-7 minutes to boil some vegetables/instant rice/lentils or clean up, etc. 

Now you have a fairly healthy meal within 30 minutes using discardable aluminum foil and maybe one pot and you only need to be in the kitchen for less than 10 minutes. You can also do this with sausage, but flip them around halfway into the 20-25 minutes and up the heat to 400F.

If you want to crisp up the skin then just switch the oven on broil for the last couple minutes."

"Obvious reason would be the targets all being Democrats. If it was ISIS I assume the targeting would be indiscriminate (or even more likely to target Trump &amp; allies since they assuredly hate him)

So it's either A) a crazy Republican who hates Democrats or B) a crazy Democrat trying to false flag.

I would be a million times more likely to believe it was a crazy Republican if any of the bombs had detonated or anyone had been hurt. Since nothing actually happened to anyone though (besides perhaps some frightening experience) I really am not sure what to think. 

It will depend on the FBI report, how ""legitimate"" these bombs actually were. At this point they could be plastic toys. 

edit: and incase that isn't clear - if the bombs turn out to be 100% real/functional, and properly constructed (and 100% able to be detonated as is), I think that certainly reinforces motive to cause harm and would make it more likely it was actually a crazy Republican. Whereas if these are fake/prop type bombs (or lacked functional detonation mechanism), would lead me to believe it was a publicity stunt (which politically benefits Democrats)"

"You're assuming Atheists wouldn't want to learn about the room, but that's just false.

Plenty of atheists have delved into science and exploration in order to learn more. They're simply doing so without feeling the need to find some diety.

And you can't just say ""Theists agree for the sake of my argument"", that's not how it works.

If you had someone who believes in the Christian god, and someone who believes in the Egyptian gods trying to find a creator in the same room, you're going to end up with a lot of disagreement on how to go about it and what it means.

If theists want to search for their creator, and create a good world, what happens when their ideas clash? What if both ideas can't coexist?

These are important questions, wars have been fought over them in the past.

Unless your argument is just ""seeking knowledge of the world only makes sense if you believe in a creator."" Which is just silly."

"I used to bank with chase years ago. I switched after my dad died unexpectedly. He had came into a large sum of money and had it all in money orders because he didn’t trust banks. I went into chase and told them the situation and said I didn’t know what to do. They essentially immediately assumed I was trying to commit fraud and kicked me out of the bank. I went to my secondary financial institution that was a credit union. I explained everything the same as I had to chase, included how I was treated at chase, and they explained to me that they couldn’t take the money orders because they weren’t signed by my dad, but they called the issuing place for me and they said if I brought all the money orders back they would cut me a check for the amount of money orders returned. I closed all my accounts with chase and only use my credit union now.  

I understand that there were fishy things about my situation. But they didn’t even try to understand. They just assumed I was a criminal and treated me like garbage during an extremely tough time on me and my family. "

Yes, I know that doctors and parents usually try and ""fix"" them to fit a male/female stereotype, and I know that simplistic people hate nuance or anything that doesn't fit their true/false world view, but the real world is almost never as simplistic as you want to pretend it is."

"Quando a essa indagação de ter apenas um livro dito ""comunista"" e ser preso eu não posso dizer se é verdadeira.

Regardless of the controversy over control, I'm really disappointed in RWBY. It started going downhill since Monty Oum died and the last two seasons were abysmal. Despite its weaknesses in the first two seasons, I was always psyched for the next season. Now, I really don't care that much. I'll probably watch it out of nostalgia, but...it's not as good.

Most routers, even routers that offer separate 2.4GHz and 5GHz access points, route all the traffic across the same local network, so it shouldn't matter.  However _some_ routers allow you to create separate networks based on the connection method.  Unless you've specifically set that up though it's probably not the case.  If your 2.4GHz devices and 5GHz devices can usually see each other it wont be your issue.

"Rhok'delar is so damn good in Spell Hunter. My opponent usually concedes half the time that I play it, no exaggeration. 


The biggest strength of the card is that if you have it in your hand you can play your cards like there's no tomorrow, dumping cards for minor tempo to maximize the hand fill. From your opponents point of view you are desperately flailing with your last cards before entering top deck mode and all they have to do is push through, survive a few more turns, and run you out of steam - only you aren't about to run out of steam at all, you are about to play Rhok'delar and have more steam than ever before.

"You did the right thing. Absolutely, no questions about it. You had an amazing line of communication going with her. You told her your concerns about her hanging out with this guy. You didn’t demand for her to end her relationship with him. You were patient and understanding. You tried to resolve your “problems” which honestly I think they were just her way of having a legit reason for falling for this guy. Your feelings about polyamory is one I share. I think it’s normal to expect your wife to be faithful. It’s a big part of why people get married.

With brutal honesty your wife fell in love with the other guy and chose him. There was nothing you could have done to prevent it or stop it. She probably does love you but differently than the other guy. She cheated and probably will cheat on him. You seem like a really great and decent guy and you deserve a woman who respects you and loves you the way you will love her back. It’s normal for you to be angry that she seems so happy while you’re mourning your lost expectation of a future. I would hate to see it, too.  It’s perfectly normal to feel that way.

You are young. You really, really are. This has been a lesson that you’ve learned and you will be better for it. You are battered and bruised but stronger for it. Hang out with friends, get back into your hobbies and live the best life you can. Take some time to heal your heart. There is someone else out there for you. You’ll find her. Or she’ll find you. You will get through this because you have to and because you’re stronger than you think. Best wishes to a happier, healthier future."
"Not aro myself, so I can't say for certain the nuts and bolts of the mental process, but aros can still love people. They can still be affectionate, they can still give you emotional support and have your back. They can still think ""I want the best of the world for this person."" They're just not interested in forming a romantic relationship and supporting another that way. Think of it as having a few select people who you'll be like ""alright, these people, I'll give myself as selflessly and healthily as I can for a friend"". Still plenty of love and care there, just not a commitment between two people, no ""this person before anyone else"" rankings. (If an aro could please fill this in for us. I'm woefully not able to say more...)

So yeah, like sparkle said, take this as a learning opportunity. Some people love without making commitments, and that's fine. Some people make mistakes while they are breaking up because they think it's nicer/cleaner that way, and that can get others riled up. Maybe there were some hurtful things you said that you really should have channeled better by asking questions instead of what her being aro means exactly between the two of you, both long term and short term. Those are things I think you can learn from all this breakup."

"My partner spent $300 or so on a memory foam mattress and mattress pad off Amazon, brought it into our relationship and it's amazing. It's not the kind of memory foam that offers a lot of support--instead it's the cushy, soft, envelop-you-in-a-nest-of-wonder kind and the softness hasn't died in 5 years of it being used. I went from a nearly 20 year old twin mattress that had an indent in the middle from where I slept, to a college dorm mattress made tolerable by a godsend of a mattress pad, to this king sized marvel, and then realized where a lot of my back pain was coming from over the years."

"I really like your take on averages, and the bleak tone feeling stuck at one skill level, and I really like the detail about missing a toe. That was a really nice touch and it fits so well with the backstory of it being a curse. But, I have a note on language skills.

The average English speaker has an active vocabulary of 20,000 words, eight times what the narrator has. This does sound like a lot, but a whole lot of those are very specialized words or older word forms that we don't really need in everyday life. For example, it's pretty easy to get by without using words like ""splendid"" or ""eloquent"" or ""antidisestablishmentarianism"" because we have more basic words that get the general point across, except for that last one but we don't need it unless we're on the spelling bee circuit.

The rule of thumb in language learning is that five percent of words comprise 95 percent of a conversation. Five percent of the English language is only 3,000 words. As for Mandarin, government guidelines state that a 2,000 word vocabulary is literate, and most newspapers use 3,000 words. With that in mind, literacy is a bit of a problem in China. A fair guess would be that the narrator could easily get by reading menus and basic newspaper stories and not much past that as far as reading goes, but could probably live a very rich, fulfilling life in China once they're no longer considered an outsider in the local community, which would likely be easier in a more metropolitan city like Shanghai. From personal experience, I can tell you that a roughly 200 word vocabulary let me navigate 3/4 of the conversations I had in 12 days in Germany. Pro tip though, pick up lines do not translate very well.

And actually, this could give you a little more wiggle room to explore the more grim aspects of being completely average because the narrator has the means to richly communicate with most people in the world, but still feel utterly alone and stuck. 

TL;DR: the narrator would probably be able to handle all basic activities in the English and Chinese speaking worlds, and this may make their life much, much worse.

"Mentally count(on my fingers)the letters of a phrase, statement, or any verbal utterance  I made/heard/read. I like 5s and 10s bc that's at least 1 hand of letters. If the letters don't add up to a value of 5 or 10, I'll either count on my fingers until they even out into a 5 or 10, but usually I'll ""edit"" what I'm counting to bring it to a value if 5 or 10. When I ""edit"", the statement or question or whatever will oftentimes turn into a completely different statement and sometimes end up as a strange word salad or non sequitur. I think I began using my editing process  (lol) to save time, because I completely dissociate when I'm counting my letters, and running the letters over my fingers to create a 5 or 10 takes some time. This has resulted in embarrassing situations where I zone out and count what I've said, or worse, what was said to me, while the poor soul who decided to strike up a conversation with me is wondering why I'm not responding or why it's taking me so long to respond. To avoid those situations as much as possible, I began creating my Frankenstein's monster words and phrases to expedite the counting ritual and keep my zoning out to a minimum.

"Doing keto for weight loss?  Go easy on the nuts, high calories.

Here is a Beginners Guide.

**Use this macro calculator** (https://keto-calculator.ankerl.com) to determine your macro guidelines for fat, protein, carbs, and calories. 

In the calculator above, enter your “stats” -- **gender, height, weight and birth date**.

For Basic Metabolic Rate, click on the circle in front of **""Sedentary""** even if you exercise.  Most calculators exaggerate how many calories we burn with exercise, so better to not depend on burning calories via exercise when calculating your macros.

For **% Body Fat**, look for the **sentence that says ”Based on your height and weight, your body fat percentage might be around ##%.” and use the ## number they recommended for you**. (Alternately, choose the link to Comparison Pictures to see the one that looks your size, and use the ##% on that picture's label.)

For **carbs**, use **20g**

For **protein**, look for the **sentence that says: ""When in doubt, choose the middle ground. For you, that's ##g"" and use the ## number they recommend for you**. (it’s usually right under the advertisement)

**For fat, enter 20% deficit to represent how much you plan to limit your calories** every day, and then it will display how much fat and how many calories to eat daily. (If your starting weight is 350 lbs or more, maybe use 25% or 30% deficit, because you have a lot of stored body fat to burn for energy so you need less energy from the food you eat.  Experiment with different percents to see what calorie recommendations you get, choose the one that you believe you could follow). (If you’re doing keto for non-weight-loss purposes, enter 0% deficit to maintain your current weight.)

Everyone is different, but frequently a calculator ends up recommending for women weight loss a calorie limit of 1200 to 1500 calories, for men weight loss a calorie limit of 1500 to 1800 calories.  If you’re far from that, then you either have special circumstances or maybe try the calculator again.

Your “Personal Results” at the bottom summarizes your macro guidelines in grams for carbs, protein, fat and calories.  Notice that the data also indicates **the ratio percentages of calories** but this is the last time that you'll ever need to think about those percentages.  From here forward, it's all about **grams, grams, grams.**

**Use a food tracker** (I use Food Diary in MyFitnessPal; Cronometer and CarbManager are also popular) to enter your food every day. In fact, one can enter food for future days, so I enter my food for the following day or the next two or three days, which turns the food tracker into “a meal plan to follow” instead of just ""the food I already ate"". That way I plan ahead to eat all the correct amounts of fat, protein, carbs and calories.

**After you know your macro guidelines, also keep the following in mind:**

the carb guideline is a LIMIT. Don't eat more than your limit, and it's always okay to eat less.

the fat guideline is a LIMIT. Don't eat more than your limit, and it's always okay to eat less.

the protein guideline is a REQUIREMENT, that's where your nutrition comes from. Always eat your daily protein guideline, plus it's okay to eat a little extra protein.

the calorie guideline (if you expect to lose weight) is a LIMIT.  Don’t eat more than your limit, and it’s always okay to eat less. Certainly, you might eat too many calories once in a while, but over the long-term you must count or control or limit your calories to lose weight.  This is the calorie counting or portion-size control or intermittent fasting part of the plan.

**If you have a weight loss goal, then you'll also control your calories i.e. limit your calories. You’ll either count the calories, or you’ll control calories without counting by depending on the ability of fat and protein to make you feel full before you overeat and to make you feel not hungry.**  Let’s say for example that your calorie goal is 1200 calories. On a keto way of eating, most of those calories will be protein and fat, and very little carbs. Even though fat is included, you still lose weight because you’re controlling or limiting the calories over all by counting, or by controlling portion-size, or sometimes by intermittent fasting.

**For a beginner, I suggest eating ordinary keto foods** such as eggs, beef, chicken, bacon, tuna, cheese, broccoli, avocado, butter, sour cream, cream cheese, olive oil.  Lettuce or spinach salads with meat, cheese, low-carb veggies and a delicious high-fat salad dressing. Low-carb veggies with butter, salt and pepper.

Keto without tracking and without counting calories is referred to as **lazy keto method** and many r/keto folks use that successfully, either for weight loss or for general health benefits and weight maintenance. However, the one thing they do count every day is net carbs. 

They are paying attention to portion size, or they are depending on the ability of fat and protein to make them feel full before they overeat, and make them feel not hungry. Thus they control their calories without counting them. Again, the one thing they do count every day is net carbs.

Some people who follow keto way of eating for weight loss learn that they're not able to successfully control / limit their overall calories without tracking, therefore they choose **tracking keto method** to measure, weigh and count all macros (carbs and protein and fat) and also count calories to meet their macro guidelines and calories goal for weight loss.

I honestly wish I hadn’t let him go to his kid’s birthday party (I wasn’t invited) or his games (I’m not allowed there) because I think she thinks I’m not around anymore or something...But his kid would have been really upset.  Sometimes I think I put her kids before myself more than she does."

And you call WoW ""paint by numbers, roll your face across the keyboard"", but compared to FFXI and it's ""stare at your character autoattacking for a minute or so until it's time to hit an ability or weaponskill"", it's downright chaotic and nonstop.

And again, most of the ""difficulty"" from FFXI came from the ridiculous amount of time and repetition it took to level, or, really, do anything besides water your plants.  Which is why I finally said ""F this"" and moved on around WotG, and why a lot of people jumped ship in favor of WoW when the latter first came out in the first place.

"It sounds complicated, but once you've done it once or twice (the application process), it is no big deal.  Although, being able to hunt whenever you want during the year is pretty sweet.  

The big difference is that there is hardly any public land in Texas.  A lot of the land that is hunted in Colorado/New Mexico is federally managed, or lesser, state managed.  They make the rules.  

I've never stepped foot on private land in Colorado, and don't foresee the need to.  There is expansive public lands, and on limited draw tags, you don't really see hunting pressure.  On the unlimited over-the-counter tags, it can get pretty crowded, but nothing that some extra miles on the boots won't fix.  

There is one ranch in Colorado that is similar to how you say, where you can hunt all year.  But it is, like you said, all exotics.  If it is a big game species that is managed by the state (deer, elk, moose, etc.), it cannot be hunted outside of mandated ""seasons"".  Anything that is classified as exotic, a la non native, can be hunted whenever the private land owner allows.  He has fallow deer, some crazy asian sheep, etc.  DJ Rams if you want to look him up - that sounds more like what you are talking about in Texas.  "

"More than half of Americans receive more money in various types of government transfer payments (Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Social Security) than they pay in federal taxes.1

According to a report released this year by the Congressional Budget Office, only the top two income quintiles in the United States pay more in taxes than they receive in government transfers.

Not surprisingly, the lowest income quintiles receive far more in transfers than they pay in taxes: https://mises.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_1160/public/transfers_ss_taxes.JPG?itok=pVtE9zIT

In the lowest quintile, households pay only $400 in taxes (as of 2014, the most recent data available) while receiving more than $16,000 in various types of tax-funded transfer payments.

The end result is households in the bottom three quintiles have higher incomes after taxes and transfers than they do before taxes and transfers: https://mises.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_1160/public/mkt_income_vs_transfers.JPG?itok=NyHKk3bv



The second-to-top quintile is slightly worse off after taxes and transfers, and the highest quintile is sizably worse off. In other words, the top two income quintiles are subsidizing the bottom three, and the advantage, proportionally speaking, gets larger as income goes down.

The Politics of a Majority on the Dole

The political implications of this are considerable. As Ludwig von Mises once noted, once we get to the point that a majority of the voting population receives more in benefits than it pays in taxes, then voters will demand more and more wealth be transferred to them through government programs. It will then become politically necessary to extract larger and larger amounts of wealth from a minority in order to subsidize the majority.

Market economics will become less and less popular because the voters will have realized they can — in the words of James Bovard — ""vote for a living"" instead of work for a living.

These findings don't always apply at the level of the individual household, of course. In the middle quintile, especially, we'll find some households that are indeed worse off after taxes and transfers than before. This will especially be the case for households that do not yet receive old-age benefits such as Medicare and Social Security. Those households are currently being taxed to pay for current recipients of SS and Medicare. Later, however, those households will begin to receive those benefits. And, over a lifetime, they're likely to receive more in benefits than what they ""paid in.""2 This notion of ""paying in,"" however, is pure fiction, and there is no ""trust fund"" for old-age benefits, and all benefits received at any given time are funded via taxation of current wage earners.

As far as politics goes, this latter fact is very important because voters receiving old-age benefits know that any significant cut in government spending and government taxation is likely to necessitate a decline in paid benefits. This is why neither major party ever seriously talks about cutting Medicare or Social Security, and why Donald Trump has even recently declared his own love for Medicare. It's simply a redistribution of income and wealth from current wage earners to current recipients, and for most elected officials, attempting to cut these benefits would be political suicide.

At the low end, benefits more frequently take the form of ""means-tested"" benefits such as Medicaid and food stamps. And since these benefits are geared toward low-income earners, we naturally see more benefits going toward the lowest earners. Indeed, in the lowest quintile, market income is less than half of income after taxes and transfers.

But for many voters, the reality is this: any significant cuts in federal spending will mean less government benefits, either now or later.

(And don't forget that the data here doesn't even account for government employees whose ""market"" income is also government funded. In the case of those workers, cuts in government spending will reduce both their market income and their transfer income.)

Since many households at both the lowest end and near the middle receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, we end up with a situation in which the voters think tax cuts don't benefit them much — but spending cuts definitely do hurt them.

Thus, the political outcome is one in which there is plenty of political pressure to maintain spending levels — or increase them — while tax cuts aren't as popular.

Transfer Income Is Growing as a Portion of Market Incomes

Looking at transfer incomes as a percentage of market incomes, by quintile, we find significant growth since the dot-com bust of 2001: https://mises.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_1160/public/pct_income.JPG?itok=NZGihy4M


With the lowest quintile, transfer payments declined during the 1990s economic expansion, and in the wake of the 1996 welfare reform. But government transfer payments grew again following the 2001–2002 recession. Transfers dipped again as the US approached the 2008 bust, and have grown sizably ever since.

Indeed, as of 2014, transfers by this measure were at an all-time high for the second-to-lowest quintile, and were near an all-time high for the lowest quintile.

But in all quintiles, transfers have increased proportional to market income, whether due to stagnating market income or growing transfer payments. An increasing role for transfer payments can also give a false impression of overall income growth since official income numbers, as provided by federal agencies such as the Census Bureau, usually include transfer payments and other taxpayer-funded sources of income in the income data. Basically, transfer payments are padding the income data — paid for by the top income quintiles.

Perceptions Matter

Like all statistics of this sort, though, we can't get a complete picture from this alone. This data only tells us about transfer payments — which are easy to track — and doesn't tell us much about the many other ways that governments transfer wealth and income. For instance, we must also consider how regulations negatively impact the incomes of employees and business owners at all levels. And we must not ignore how money-supply inflation tends to hurt the poor the most, while tending to favor higher-income groups. And then there are government contracts — such as high-tech weapons contracts that tend to benefit higher income groups as well.

Ultimately, though, perceptions often matter more than the details behind the numbers. The CBO report reminds us that a great many voters receive government welfare checks of various types, and the perception is that any true cuts in spending will bring a high cost to those who have become accustomed to their taxpayer-funded benefits. Ultimately, the effects on voting patterns and public policy will be very real.

1. In this article, transfer payments include both ""social insurance benefits and means-tested transfers. Social insurance benefits consist of benefits from Social Security (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance); Medicare (measured as the average cost to the government of providing those benefits); unemployment insurance; and workers’
compensation. Means-tested transfers are cash payments and in-kind services provided through federal, state, and local government assistance programs. Eligibility to receive such transfers is determined primarily on the basis of income, which must be below certain thresholds. The largest transfer programs are Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (measured as the average cost to the government of providing those benefits); the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as the Food Stamp program), and Supplemental Security Income.
2. According to the Urban Institute: ""a two-earner couple receiving an average wage — $44,600 per spouse in 2012 dollars — and turning 65 in 2010 would have paid $722,000 into Social Security and Medicare and can be expected to take out $966,000 in benefits. So, this couple will be paid about one-third more in benefits than they paid in taxes.""

"That's a very individualist way of looking at things. Porn harms women as a class. We need to gain some class consciousness/solidarity and not engage in/tolerate behaviours that harm other women, or at the very least, recognise the issues rather than getting reflexively defensive."

"Teferi is a prefectly valid win condition. It only seems obnoxious if you stubbornly refuse to concede once the lock is fully established. You’ve already lost at that point, and dragging the game out and forcing the Teferi player to finish you off is the real waste of time; you have no cards in play. You have no cards in hand. They have a full grip and Teferi’s Emblem. You’ve lost. There are no 1 CMC outs to that state in standard right now. It’s over, so refusing to concede is what make the game go long.

Teferi is perfectly valid. Lockout control decks are  nearly as old as Magic itself. Mill decks are a long established archetype. Go watch anyone play Lantern Control or Stax N Tax and then tell me you think Teferi isn’t a fair finisher."
I think it's more like 90% to 95%

Your descriptions and the fact that you used the word 'image' at all makes it pretty unlikely you have aphantasia or even low visualization. If I try to imagine anything there is nothing even remotely close to an image. If I try with my eyes closed, it's just black. I can't even so much as imagine light.

I can hold designs in my brain mostly though spacial knowledge. I design in my head in concepts and verbally, and I can know I want something to be a certain color or material, but I can't even come close to visualizing anything. It's exciting to design on a computer because I get to see what I was thinking made into something I can see."
"Actually there is one place called ""Sheikh"" that serves shisha but it's tobacco free stones only. I've never been there as it probably is overpriced and it's not even tobacco lol.

The price on the shisha itself depends on the size I think, just go to Grønland and you'll find it everywhere. If u buy a small/middle sized one you'll probably find one for around 200kr. If u want a bigger you might look at 500-800 price range.

If he had taken up a kneeling position aimed outward towards a potential threat, and have his squad mates pass behind him, it would've made the scene so much better for me. Proper gun safety and military training can exist in Star Wars too! :P

Otherwise, this was literally perfect and I'm very impressed. I hope to see more from this crew!"

"Holy shit was I trainwreck early on. I usually chalked it up to bad luck, but often it was stuff that I wasn't getting or executive issues that I failed on that caused a lot of stuff. 

The first was building structure for myself and a routine. It's boring as hell, but I started looking at my days like plane flights, where I get up early enough to edge my way into the day, and a couple hours before I go to bed, I would wind down. I started cutting out staying up super late because, while it was fun, it was making my days harder manage.

Next, I started learning to look at my problems and try to learn my way through them. I'm shit at social stuff, but I worked on developing gumption and perseverance. When something would fail or I would get upset at it, I learned to step away and say, ""I'm an adult, no one is forcing me to do this, being upset won't fix this, and I should step away and come back later."" 

I started picking up books and looking things up that most people didn't think much about and started reading my way through them, because you never know if someone may have something helpful. And especially in my case, often I was doing stuff wrong, but I didn't know what it was. So, doing a primer on the basics was extremely helpful. The books that really helped me early on were *It's Your Money or your Life,* which is dated, but it's about thinking about finances in a different way. *Rich Dad, Poor Dad* is another. I also read Strunk &amp; White's *Elements of Style*, which taught me how to write better. It got me into grad school.

I realized I needed to learn how to dress myself, so I started hanging around /r/malefashionadvice and started learning about types of clothes, color theory, and how to put a respectable wardrobe and outfit together. 

I realized I needed practice talking, so I would go on Omegle and start conversations. I would build scripts. When things got weird, I went to the next person, over and over.

In short, I stopped trying to think things were just bad luck or attempting to blame someone about them, then just worked on learning to fix them. It was simple pragmatism.

Beyond that, there was a lot of luck involved too. I met my partner, and we've not had a super tumultuous relationship or anything. I found jobs at small companies and found ones that rewarded me for going out of my way to fix stuff. So, I found a career path and I moved up.

It's a lot of work, and part of it is learning to make things into games. I'm more patient about fixing problems than my partner because I learned to channel my frustrations and try to accept bad situations and think of it as a strategy game. I also literally ""play"" Khan Academy. Currently, I'm learning Guitar with Rocksmith. 

As far as having my shit together, there's still a lot of stuff, but middle-aged stuff. My partner is about to graduate with her doctorate, I'm mid career at a job and need a path forward, and I have a house that requires constant maintenance that I can't afford, and student loans.

I think it's pretty neat that others didn't get things worked out until their 30s too. I feel so behind when I look in communities on here and people who are 22 are talking about buying houses or making $60k/year. "

"Domestic pets aren't useful to the level that farm animals are. Farms need animals, and they abuse their animals to make logistical problems easier. They do it with a logical motive.

Dogs are kept, in most cases, for sentimental reasons. Therefore, abusing them has no purpose except for emotional reasons. A person whose emotions tell them to abuse animals is worse on the inside.

Additionally, dogs are the animals most consciously manipulated by humans. We domesticated cows and chickens, we *invented* dogs. Taking advantage of this interspecies bond makes the bond itself of questionable morality."

I'm guessing you are young, married young.  You have depended on your DH for a lot, even prior to marriage. You also depend (or did depend) on his parents.  You are trying to find your way now, but there is a history of them supporting you.  Almost like helicopter parent levels of taking care of you.  This was your first time in a bad situation where you really wanted to handle it yourself but you don't have the ""tools"" yet because of lack of exposure to these situations or they've handled them in the past.  Hence your level of ""gratitude"" because you didn't really know what to do. But you want to figure it out, and that chance was abruptly taken from you.  

I don't think they did anything ""wrong"", they were just sticking with the status quo, which has become wrong because you are ready to do things yourself. Let this be your lesson. Don't be mad at them but be glad that you WANTED to do this yourself, so you are growing.   Let them know that you appreciate knowing they have your back, but next time, could they coach you on how you could do the same thing yourself.  It sounds like your manager was walking all over you and MIL was having them back peddling. Ask her to teach you her ways.  

Now, if they keep trying to handle things for you after you express your desires to start being a strong and independent woman, then they are very, very wrong.  But until you express that, give them the benefit of the doubt, because it sounds like they all truly care for you.  "

Other than checking emails and messages etc. I also had left my wife's phone connected for several months. What prompted me to change that was when I checked her office voice mail (she ran her own business) and had several recent messages from a client who obviously didn't know and was wanting her to start a new project. We worked out of the same office together so I recognized who he was and knew that she had enjoyed working with him. I definitely wanted to make sure to let him know what had happened. Making that call back to him to explain that she was gone was horrid. Not wanting it to happen again with anyone else I immediately disconnected the service to her office line and cell phone. I do still have the actual phone at least. It just doesn't have service any longer.
"&gt; What I *think* you are going for is the new movies were just new sc-fi movies but not Star Wars movies, would they still be bad?

[](/sp)

[](/ktrixietrick)OK, ya' got me there with the rip-off thing! I guess its saving grace would be people getting to watch a modern take on *A New Hope*, but if that's all it's going for it...eh.

[](/sp)

[](/kflashsentrynoproblem)Still, I'm looking forward to what Abrams does to Episode IX if only out of sheer curiosity and how VIII was handled. I heard it'd be the end of the Skywalker saga, so I'd be interested to at least see the grand finale of Star Wars.

[](/sp)

[](/krarityheadtilt)As for Abrams and Star Trek: So, pretty much falling into the same problem as Star Wars these days? The mass appeal thing?

[](/sp)

[](/ksunburstfear)I think it's fun to watch as a casual, but not so for many dedicated Trekkies. Having a director who is faithful to the series' tone would make the movies, well, more philosophical, more thoughtful, more consistent. Even if they wouldn't appeal to the masses as much as Abrams's movies are now, they'd be vindicated by history when people pick it apart and see how they hold up as a beautiful whole.

Both of them wear super well, they look good after 12 hour days"

"So guys, what are some of your favorite wunderwaffe?

I guess one of mine is Die Glocke, simply because I find the name so banal it's hilarious and I personally think the whole thing is a hoax, especially as there is no documentation of any project by that name.

As for ""realistic""...more or less...Wunderwaffen. One of my personal favorites has to be the H-class battleships and how they escalated in size because of Albert ""Totally ignorant of the Holocaust"" Speer's influence.

The specifications for the H-44 are just ridiculous. 345 meters long, weighing 140k tons with its main battery consisting of four turrets each with four 20 inch guns. In wartime with resource scarcity and an economy running on fumes? How much Nazi meth is required to think this a reality?"

"Every other EV/car company is way behind on a national or multi-national charging network like Tesla has. 

Keep in mind that there is a cheaper EV with very high range, the Chevy Bolt, that has been on the market for well over a year now (without wait times) but it is selling what, less than 1/10th as many vehicles per month despite the much lower cost? You need more than affordable and long range. You need a car that can replace a gas car in all instances--that makes it compelling in the mainstream.

Tesla's supercharger network is not even that expensive to build out, but permitting and finding locations suitable to provide high peak power can be very time consuming. Other car companies and manufacturers are years behind on this.

No, dealer networks do not help with the charging problem. Dealers are primarily clustered inside cities, where charging networks are least needed. They aren't open/available 24/7 and usually don't have 24/7 businesses nearby like superchargers do. Nissan already has thousands of chargers at their dealerships across the US, and it hasn't helped Leaf adoption appreciably."

Linkwood is a Diageo owned distillery whose juice mainly ends up in blends such as Johnny Walker.  Diageo does few official releases but Linkwood pops up frequently in IBs.  The Linkwoods I have had tend to be light and fruity, this one isn't different.  I just [reviewed a 20 yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/9qv44v/review_188_1997_signatory_linkwood_20_year_old/e8bzy46) but forgot to SbS them.  

**Color** \- Amber

**Nose** \- Big fruit - white grapes, apples, Korean pears, lemon zest, vanilla, floral notes

**Palate** \- Cooked apples, baking spices, caramel

**Finish** \-Medium - Toffee, allspice, mild poached apple tart, malt

**Overall** \- 6 - This one is very similar to the Linkwood I had yesterday.  Strangely, the nose of this is heavy fruit but less fruit on the palate/finish, the opposite of the 20 I just had.  It is maltier and spicier as well.  Very nice dram and very drinkable.  Classic Linkwood profile leaves me wanting more.  Only in comparison to the other Linkwood does this fall a little short.

"God of War is a fucking work of art. The story is simple and low-stakes, but beautiful and engaging. The combat is intricate, but has a natural flow to it and every move/skill feels perfectly balanced.

For once in a long, long time, I feel like I got a whole complete fucking game in one package!

I feel sorry for anyone denying themselves the experience of this game just because they're too busy being a mouth-breathing fanboy for another console.

I say this all as someone who has never played the previous games in the series and hasn't even owned a non-Nintendo console since the PS2 era. I honestly couldn't give a shit about the Xbox/PS4 debate.

What I'm saying is that animals don't just trust people because you feed and pat them. You need to be familiar to some of them before they'll let you feed and pat them. Not all cats are the same. Life experiences can alter how animals perceive humans. It's not just a case of feed and pet them and they will love you for life. Cats and dogs are social animals and by taking them into your home you are accepting them into your pack/pride. If they've been traumatised they might never trust you no matter how much you feed or pat them.

In fact like children they may be more likely to accept attention if you are friendly to the owner. It's not as simple as food and pats."

"This is a very good topic I love seeing both sides of the fence.  Myself started in July 2016 I normally spend around $100 every 2-3 months buy special gift boxes when I need super incubators and lures. I made it to level 40 before xp was free and did the grind and evolved everything possible for tiny xp gains I am a suburban player that travels so raids and gyms never interested me until after I maxed my level. The best part of this game as my kids account is level 30 and after three months is you can play and the game is still relevant battles/defense.  Some other games need a large investment every month to play and be competitive, this game is set up to play as you go, yes you need raid passes to get the newest monsters, yes you need incubators for some as well to complete a dex but your account wont be useless due to not spending money. My kids level account has $25 spent for a box and incense cause we have no spawn points at home.  Please remember Niantic has many people employed they have licensing fees they have servers to pay for. I think they are doing a pretty good job balancing things, if only they would communicate better at times lol. If you want to see bad games that rape the players look at any MZ game like game of war and what they did . Overall with four go pluses lost one two died, gas etc probably easily $1000 or more.

The only people that I have physical contact with are my parents, and I dunno, it just doesn’t seem like they really mean it. Like I’m getting a hug because they know I want one, not because they want to give one. I know they love me, I guess they just don’t really know how to show that.

That sounds so nice though, I have pretty bad anxiety and I can imagine the relief that I would get from regular cuddling.

I’ve definitely had moments where some physical contact has caused an unexpected emotional response."

just because you have not been exposed to a variety of black people doesn’t mean i have to stoop down to your ignorance. Obama is a lighter skinned biracial man and it is obvious that he has a mixture. 

if a person is half asian and half white genetically, what would you call them? if they have slightly slanted eyes, pale skin, small nose, dark hair and speak both a European language and a bit of an Asian language, would you say they are just Asian? would you say they are just White?

There's a huge problem in San Antonio's backyards. And the city doesn't know how to handle it appropriately through its municipalities. 

The cuts are in, the population explosion is forcing an interesting effect on the native population. 

The city is blowing up, but the resources aren't being spread out appropriately creating a larger deficit to arise. 

The education systems are on a rapid decline. 

The heroin and methamphetamine epidemic will also continue to increase poverty, crime, and these types of casualties amongst families. 

Statistically, the problem is growing more exponential rather than solutions are becoming more rapidly available. 

The rehabilitation programs in San Antonio through the municipal courts are not rehabilitation according to the understanding of modern psychology.

"Title: Hospital dismissed my suspicioun of ectopic pregnancy, lost fallopian tube?

Original Post: 

&gt; (California) We found out I was pregnant on October 12th after having lower abdominal pain on the Left side of my abdomin for a week. Went to new obgyn, Dr. K, on October 16th. She did a 30 second ultrasound, found nothing in my uterus and saw light spotting. I told her I primarily felt pain in the Left side of my abdomin. She assumed it was the beginning of a miscarriage or it could be ectopic, but most likely miscarriage. I took a blood test to measure my pregnancy hormones (which were low for 6 weeks) and went home. 
&gt; 
&gt; October 17th I woke up to excruciating pain I could barely move from. Went to my hospitals walk-in women center, only a nurse saw me who just advised Tylenol. A couple hours later the pain comes back and there's more blood. I go to the ER. I told the Dr I was worried about ectopic pregnancy as again, the pain was mostly on my Left side. They took my blood, did not do any imaging, saw that my pregnancy hormone level dropped, and assumed miscarriage. 
&gt; 
&gt; 5 days go by and besides the passing of blood, teeny tiny crumbly tissue, and more lower L abdomin pain, I develop an enormous bloated belly despite having little appetite. 
&gt; 
&gt; October 22, I walk into urgent care for my bloating and heavy bleeding. I again mention my pain on my Left lower abdominal side and this time the new Dr listened. They took blood and did a very thorough 20-minute ultrasound. Something was wrong with my Left ovary and there was a lot of fluid/blood accumulating which explained the bloating. My pregnancy hormone levels jumped back up as well which was an anomoly. Surprise- it's an ectopic pregnancy that had ruptured and I have to have surgery immediately. 
&gt; 
&gt; A D&amp;amp;C was performed to clear out content of my uterus (surgeon reported not having found miscarriage tissue) and then a laparoscopy to remove my ruptured Left fallopian tube as well as blood build up behind uterus. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **TLDR; Hospital dismissed my suspicioun of ectopic pregnancy multiple times, told me it was a miscarriage. 2 weeks later it IS ectopic after my Fallopian tube ruptured and had to have emergency surgery. Should I file complaint with hospital? **

"Honestly. It's not exactly rocket science to invest into areas where you have some good grasp of expertise. The stock is going to go back up eventually. Right now the GPU market decreased, Nvidia and Intel released their better products, the numbers aren't AS great as people hoped they would be (they are still good nonetheless), the stock as slightly overvalued due to the hype and Zen2 is ahead of us. If Zen2 and Epyc2 aren't failures, the stock is definitely going back up. Even moreso, if Navi turns out to be good as well (albeit this one is a bit more shaky and thus risky).

&amp;#x200B;

The stock market for medium-term investments (3-24months) really isn't rocket science, if you know what's up. Been doing that for 5 years now where each year I look for a few stocks within my fields of expertise and invest money on it. Gotta do it smart, though.

At the beginning of the year I had the choice between AMD, Micron and BVB GmbH &amp; Co.KGaA (german football club). Eventually decided for BVB once they hired Favre. All 3 increased, though. AMD obviously would've been the best bet, but a 60% increase isn't too bad for me, either. After the original Micron-Hype due to I think it was Goldman Sachs recommending it - it's back to where it started this year. It's still pretty decent and I am sure it will increase again fairly soon. Albeit it's not gonna do the huge jump as AMD could do from 9,50 to 33. Neither will AMD do it anytime soon again. This was pretty much a Cinderella story.

Also could have easily bet on Intel or german Car-manufacturers going down - but I am not too confident with Short-Sellings as of now. Those were pretty obvious to happen nonetheless, if you have the necessary expertise to know it was going to happen (Intel due to supply shortage and the german car-manufacturers due to the new lawmaking in Germany pushed by the Green party and the general left-wing to forbid Diesel-cars which essentially renders 30-35% of the production useless as the parties are full-force pushing it).

&amp;#x200B;

It really all comes down to expertise in the field. And if you have disposable money that you can risk and have enough self-restraint to not gamble and also know when you messed up - if you did. Then it can be quite easy money. In said 5 years I am pretty much up by 300% at this point. Unfortunately 300% of 2000 bucks isn't that much, but that's my disposable money.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Amd is gonna go back up. But I am not sure if it might fall a bit more until then. Personally considering to selling my BVB-stock right now and go to AMD due to it."
"Sorry, long post

Idk if this is ok to do but here's a link to dailydiapers forum of incontinence desires (https://www.dailydiapers.com/board/index.php?/forum/48-incontinent-desires/) and your question might be better answered over there.
I've recently done a lot of reading in this sub Forum, doing this is not an interest of mine, but it's very interesting to read what people have done and are willing to do to be diaper dependant. Some people say this training is reversible but others say it's not. Also on tumblr http://serah-in-diapers.tumblr.com and http://diapertrainingashley.tumblr.com (both nsfw accounts, they are basically porn) talk about their journey into diaper dependence. But one, or both, mention a side effect of becoming dependent also leads into bowl incontinence... They also say it takes about a year to lose bladder control and in the process you will lose bowl control. 
So if you plan on doing this, make sure this is what you want with no hope of coming back!

I've only been reading about this for about a month so I'm no expert and (as I mentioned earlier) never plan on doing this myself. The people that have done this love every bit of the end goal, but personally (not knowing if your life style can support it) I wouldn't recommend attempting such a thing... If you do decide to do this I wish you the best of luck!!! It could be a fun road for you to go down and very rewarding! I also hope I have provided you good information or where to find information to help you reach diaper dependence! But not knowing if you can reverse it, maybe just stick to enjoying your diapers and not being them and try just going 24/7..."

To me its interesting that you feel attacked for it?  Not see it as well, criticism against the shop. 
why not next time instead of taking it as attack, maybe tell her : well, its shitty you didn't get a new shirt, do you want me to ask whether they have one in your size?  
If she gets written down for shoes that are like yours and you feel you have a good rapport with higher ups, why not ask for clarification?

try to not get defensive unless she really attacks you.     
If you feel attack, breathe, try to relax and when you got some emotional distance,try thinking about whether she maybe had a point?  
look at it not as against you. but as general observation

I have one of those sweatshirts with a pouch. I think it is supposed to be for a cat but my sweet Lurch seems to enjoy sleeping in the pouch.
"&gt;do u have an example in the show, cause it might just be due to the actress or way scenes are written.

It is a combination, you know how you know someone but you piece together. 

I mean I'd chalk it purely up to the actress (which I did first episode or 2) but it isnt just how she says it but what too. Granted writing. 

Even when she is concerned for her sister it seems superficial and smiley. Again for a minute I almost blamed the actress but the oddly written romance hopping and the way she became with her powers. 

I mean I did say I kind of get it. Her and her sister are basically rich kids of local royalty, straight A student star athletes without the powers. The older one given more responsibility etc is the almost aunt like super med student, teacher, princess.

The younger is the quasi low key rebel emo girl. 

I think it sort of makes sense... but damn. Lol.

Anissa plus her facial features etc... and smiles. 

It is just odd compared to most characters. I'm not even necessarily negative about it asI find it interesting and it leaves me guessing about her character development. 

But basically I could almost see her borderline go bad (sort of like how she goes stealing money) or stay really good. 

But even her dad gets on her and whatnot. I think she had he powers too long now so the responses ""high on or enjoying her powers"" are forgetting she was basically a brazen smiley carefree person before. 

Which tbh makes the writing better in a Sens that I find her behavior with the powers very sensible to her pre-powered character unlike the inexplicable desire of Snow to turn evil bc she has a power. 

Maybe in a sense I even partially identify with some aspects of Anissa as I said in terms of how I handle bad things. But she just...takes it to another level lol. 

Just trying to understand her. 

Jennifer is 2018 whiney woe is me standard stock. Like most heroes even. Divorced-ish BL and his whiney wife...

Yeah yeah nothing new. 

Annisa is like Wally West and Johnny Storm had a gay love child turned lesbian with the aid of a more cheerful Magneto? Lol idk. It is different."

"They can claim whatever they want. If they want to prove it, they should get a survey. No one really ""regulates"" property line disputes, that is a civil matter. They will probably have an in-house attorney send you some threatening letters but they can't really do much to you legally - if they remove the fence call the cops and make a report. They are the ones with a problem, they should get a survey. 

That said, GIS and aerial photography can be off, up to several feet is pretty common in my area. They may very well be right. You don't say how big your property is, if 2 ft is likely to make a big difference or not. I might be open to a negotiation where they bring in a crew to move the fence at no cost to me, if it settles it and everyone is happy going forward. But the only way to really know for sure is to get a survey. "

They have this idea that a new car comes with its own set of issues, whereas their cars are ""known"" to them.

"Of the three you listed, I would probably recommend black. Bardock and hit both have short range, fast assists with almost no blockstun. Trunks's assist is considered one of the best in the game, and a lot of pros play him as an anchor, which is good considering Hit and Bardock should probably be in the point/mid positions. However, Trunks has a high skillcap and I think at lower levels he is better suited for point/mid as well and really benefits from having assists to back him up. Black on the other hand is a great anchor at any level and would be very helpful to have on your team since his beam assist is so useful in neutral.

I wouldn't consider SSB Vegeta if I were you. Unless you absolutely love his playstyle."
"4 years... that magic number keeps popping up ever since I read about it. For those that don't know, long story short: 4 years is when a womans sexual attraction for you switches to a platonic, affectionate love (and she may not possess that either). There's actual science done on this, sexual cycles of women or something, that describe this and it always seems to come up. This woman is no longer sexually attracted to her bf, but she now loves him 'like a brother' hence why she's having a dilemma over this. If you want to keep a girl sexually attracted to you for longer than 4 years, fuck with her cycle - cause a lot of drama, cheat on her then 'win her back', break up 3843438938 times and fuck her while broken up... This will keep her on edge and attracted to you sexually past the normal expiration date lmao just go MGTOW"

"&gt;You didn't say a word in any of that about what a person actually does with their life outside of having children.

The only way you can come to that conclusion is if you ignored the things I've written in my previous comments or failed to read them. Read below.

Let me pose you this; does completing the main quest in a story really give the best experience of the game?... Some games might have really enriching and personally fulfilling content that supercedes the experience of the main quest. To me, life is one of these.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not necessarily, I'll agree that side content can be more enjoyable than the main content, but that doesn't take away the importance of the main quest. To continue the Skyrim example, I'll admit that the main quest is kinda boring and that most of my fun from that game did come from just messing around and exploring, but can you really say you had the full experience without actually completing the Dragonborn quests and defeating Alduin? Child rearing may not be fulfilling to everyone, but how is it not the objective ""main quest"" of life? It's necessary to have the full experience.

That way, I can see my balance, and see it go down.

"Umm...

P.2: I explained in my post that I was comparing the combined offensive and defensive DVOAs (so excluding special teams) and being ranked 32nd then and 32nd now in special teams DVOA doesn't mean they haven't improved. They had a -42.3% after week 1 (the chiefs game), a -14.3% after week 3, and are -5.9% now...that's a pretty marked improvement.

P.3: That's a fun story. Not quite clear on how you come up with that or what that even means.

P.4: I was using that as a fairly concrete example of what home field (with a crowd that is noisy and makes life difficult on the away team) advantage means. Oddsmakers have to be pretty good at making the lines otherwise they're at serious risk of not being profitable. They give a standard 3 point advantage to the home team all else equal. It's been well documented how the chargers often have more away fans in their home stadium on gameday, pretty much eliminating the majority of the home field advantage. Now the home crowd noise isn't all of the advantage but I think it is the biggest factor.

P.5: Berry will help the D, as will sorenson. Congrats! Doesn't mean anything as far as whether the Chargers are an overrated team or not.

P.6: The chargers schedule does get tougher, but I contend they'll do pretty well through that stretch. What you stated initially isn't false but it's also not a great argument for whether a team is over/underrated...So they lost to the two best teams in the league (at the moment) and beat every other team they played (mostly bad teams)...yep. The only thing that proves is that they're maybe not the best or worst team in the league. I've seen a lot of power rankings that have them around #6 and I've seen/heard a lot of talk about how good the NO, NE, KC, and LAR offenses are and I think the Chargers could easily slot in as the 3rd best team at the moment and certainly should be mentioned amongst that list of 4 teams when discussing best offenses in the league. So not overrated.

And my high horse comment was aimed at the fact that you chimed in several times on this thread with that same argument anytime someone listed the chargers as underrated. I assumed it was because of your Chiefs fandom and some weird disdain for any of the division rivals getting some love. I apologize if that was a bad assumption. It's tough to not hear from just about every media outlet how great the Chiefs are and I just want to make sure people know that the Chargers are a pretty good side too."

"Ideally we would get a DC that has years of experience in that role with a bonus if they were a former HC in the NFL.

John Fox, Rex Ryan, and Jack Del Rio are three that come top of mind. Del Rio is probably the strongest candidate out of the three to accept that position, especially with the Lynch, Peters, Elway connection from DEN as Del Rio was their DC before he got the Raiders gig.

Richard Smith, Mike Nolan, and Jim Haslett are positional coaches with former DC experience. Nolan can help usher back a 3-4 D and has proven to be a strong talent evaluator.

Vance Joseph and Sean McDermott are two current HCs that are on the chopping block. I'd prefer McDermott because he can bring Leslie Frazier with him as a DBs coach.

Even if Saleh stays, Shanahan should find an assistant HC - defense role for his staff. It's clear they both need the help to prove that side of the ball.

Fox, Del Rio, and McDermott would be my short list for the gig. "

Highest individual might: 3515, Halloween Althemia (5-stars) with 45 mana nodes. She's got a 4-star elemental staff (level 50), Plunder Pals (MUB, level 97) and Lindworm (level 40, 20 bond strength).

I would have gone with a bit more granularity on the team might thing for the poll.

Also remember that players here are probably higher power than average.

Incidentally, might by element:

Water: 8805 (100% water, Lily/Karina/Ricardt/Celliera)

Fire: 9015 (50% fire, Euden/Verica/Aeleen/Orion, will probably be powering up additional fire units when it becomes relevant but I've not bothered)

Wind: 9109 (75% wind, Aeleen/Musashi/Eleonora/Halloween Althemia, these guys are barely powered up at all and a lot of the might comes from Althemia. Will probably focus on Musashi as my next character to power up)

Light: 10533 (100% light, Halloween Althemia/Estelle/Luca/Malka. Althemia is at 45 rings, the others are at 29 or 30).

Dark: 9501 (75% dark, Orion/Kleimann/Cleo/Euden. Orion is just barely on the third ring, Kleimann and Cleo still on ring 2)."

"The rules of the road under the Highway Traffic Act and the fault determination rules under the Insurance Act are distinct beasts.

Your insuror seems to be of the view that you were overtaking the tractor. Overtaking means to pass them to the left hand side of the yellow line, in line with oncoming traffic. If you were simply passing using the left lane, this rule does not apply.

I can see merit in an argument that the driver of the tractor is 100% at fault if the tractor began a left hand turn as you were overtaking. The FDR deals only with only with overtaking while a left hand turn has already started. As you stated as well, failure to signal a turn that may affect the movement or safety of another driver is a driving offence and this would render the ordinary FDR moot because those matters must be determined by rule of law. However, unless there's some evidence other than your memory that a signal was not made, your chances of prevailing in court are precarious at best."

"Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**



Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

"Yo MK, looking at the Vorex Race 3. I have the Pok3r and LOVE the build quality, wondering if it's the same on the Race 3? If you have experience with the layout let me know what you think, or the pros/cons. The price isn't too bad especially if its build quality is = to the Pok3r. Also, how are the keycaps?

"I'm not saying these changes are good or bad, only time will tell. However battle royals are about adapting and making the most out of what you're given. It is life changing money and the players that win it will be the ones that can adapt. It is very likely that the best will still be on top. Some stuff seems unfair to the players but it is a huge risk getting involved with a new esport. The potential for money can outweigh that risk. Maybe unexpected changes like this will bring in a wave of new fans allowing for even bigger prize pools. I'm not supporting it just trying understand from both point of views. "
"These kinds of things disgust me. At a pep rally, there was a mock ""Bachelorette"" segment where one girl asked scripted questions and got scripted answers. It was meant to be harmless and funny, and I think most people enjoyed it, but i was disgusted. For clarification there was one guy who was the designated ""fuck boy"" or ""pushy and overconfident"" giving answers like ""I see, *myself* in you"" to the question ""What do you see in me?"". Horrid experience. 0/10 would not go through again if possible. There were other things but this one just felt revolting."

"Conquest maps are way too gimmicky for me. It feels almost dishonest in a way. I also really don't like the weapon system. The stat penalties for using strong weapons are way too dire. With limited uses, they're a sort of resource management decision, where you're encouraged to use your good stuff when you need to. Even in Gaiden and SoV where you have unlimited uses there's still an element of resource management because you have to decide who gets what items from needing them the most With Fates weapons it's more like ""is it safe to use this strong weapon"". It adds an element of risk without much in the way of reward usually. And this is already on top of how Fire Emblem gameplay inherently already has a high level of risk vs reward because of permadeath.

I'm glad it looks like FE16 is going back to what works instead of trying to fix it."

It was college, so we thought we were being woke, before woke was a thing (2008). 

I also did Mace Windu, since he was my favorite Jedi from the prequels (and I’ve got a Samuel L. man crush), which basically meant any other Jedi except with a purple lightsaber. Not trying to be clever that time, just, again, didn’t do blackface so it was ok. "

I have zero love Democrat politicians. They’re weak and they let Republican politicians walk all over them and that doesn’t seem to be changing at all for the better. I would like to see them take power come November cause no matter how I feel about them, Republicans politicians are the fucking worst. So I will be voting against for them against all Republicans for now on. If the Dem’s take power and positive change isn’t made, well I’m fucked cuz then I will not vote for either a D or R again, unless certain politicians from either party woo the fuck outta me. 

So I’m not a Democrat but I’m tired of Republicans and their god awful policies and rhetoric.

How could they even pretend it’s real? For one they gotta pay to get in and they gotta pay to see a girl. There are bouncers there. There are signs and rules. There are cameras. At no point can you fool yourself that it’s just a bar and some cute girl is genuinely interested in you. It’s not even a realistic setting. Girls in clubs don’t wear lingerie or walk around topless. And even after you get a dance from a girl you watch her go to the next guy and do the same thing. You know it’s fake from start to finish, like a movie or a haunted house. It’s escapism.

"Sam Young was excommunicated for his persistence in publicly attacking &amp; opposing the Church's leaders, not for his position/opinion. The following article provides a report &amp; discussion of the ongoing story: r/https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900032216/sam-young-announces-he-was-excommunicated-by-local-church-leaders.html

As for your personal investigation of the Church, I'd advise you to try not to get hung up on ""he said, she said"" issues like this. Focus instead on the the important matters; to wit: Is The Book of Mormon true? Was Joseph Smith a prophet of God? Can husbands &amp; wives and parents &amp; children really be together forever (as a couple/family) by the power of the holy priesthood? Is the Church today really guided by living apostles &amp; prophets (just like in the Bible)?

These are the questions you should be seeking answers to. They're the kind of questions that matter. That have eternal significance. And leave the question of who is right and who is wrong in the case of Sam Young to the Lord. You're never going to get to the bottom of that one, and it likely has no bearing on you."

"The normal proposition is a positive claim;


God exists, with specific attributes.


Atheists can't make negative claims, because negative claims aren't falsifiable only positive claims are. It is also kind of an oversimplification. There are tens of thousands of gods and millions of interpretations; is an atheist going to go over all of them?


You won't find a formal proposition that god doesn't exist, you'll find the response they haven't been provided with evidence to show God exists leading into the exhaustive response that there is no evidence of God that is convincing so we certainly shouldn't behave like God exists and most likely god does not exist. This in turn leads to God doesn't exist.


You can still provide evidence of God's existence though. It just needs to be compelling and sensical. That is still the argument structure, unless you'd like to sit along to a discussion narrowly defining all the Gods and faeries let alone the supernatural."
"That’s not a bill, it’s an estimate for the treatment that they want to sell to you. The dentist’s office is a business, and they make money when you spend it.

Yes, teeth are important. They’re part of your overall health plus a big part of self-presentation. It’s understandable that you want to improve your teeth. Think of this as a plan for what’s possible over the next 5-10 years, not a bill that’s due.

Since you don’t have the money to do this all right now, you will have to triage the treatment based on what’s most urgent and pay as you go. There’s Care Credit and similar options, but without an income you’re unlikely to qualify.

The wisdom teeth do have to come out, one way or another. Do you have medical insurance, or could you purchase it? Extraction of impacted wisdom teeth might be covered under medical insurance. The dental school option is a good one if you can’t get medical insurance that covers it.

You don’t need any of the other things immediately, except maybe fillings. Call around and get quotes for that, including from your local dental school.

On the plus side, when you graduate and get a job with benefits, you will probably be able to get those braces for about $1000 less. Different orthodontists have different techniques. The one that you choose to do your braces down the road might have a different opinion on what to do with that tooth.

Actual attacks are less likely to be false flags because it's much more rare to find people willing to take the life of a team member for their cause.

"&gt;Further, you failed to mention that the GAO report acknowledges that Islamic terrorist activity is significantly more deadly per incident. 

It wasn't relevant to the discussion on whether right wing or left wing ideologues commit more politically inspired homicides.

You're lumping different types of violence into one classification, whereas I'm being very specific about what I'm talking about and that is that right wing ideologues have committed more politically driven homicides than left wing ideologues.  In this context, with Rush Limbaugh saying that Republicans or conservatives never would have committed to an action with the intent to kill or maim isn't supported by the statistics.

I'm not making a blanket claim that one group is more likely to commit violence *in general* (that would include acts of physical violence against people and violence against property), but that one group has committed more acts of a specific type of violence (that could maim or kill people)."

Actually no. You basically get one free game from Redbox if you’re an asshole. They can’t just automatically charge the last person that rented it because what if they just didn’t call and took the loss? What if the person calling is reporting it but is the one doing it? You can just charge someone without actual evidence. In actuality what they’ll do is flag the reporters card and flag the last few people to rent the disc and if one of those other cards gets a second flag then you’ve found your culprit and they’ll be banned from using Redbox with that card and probably charged.

Honestly, if states would get together and start getting on the same page with guns like they are doing with marijuana, things would go a lot smoother."

I don't like Prager and his Christian agenda 
"    I am personally a little disappointed at the lack of Asian... representation

Don't sweat it too much! I'm impressed that you looked into this and pulled this together.

I can't speak for other Asians, but in Chinese culture the traditional or historical concept of ""witch"" is completely foreign to what you would consider ""witchy."" It would be more like a ""fox fairy"" or ""white haired ghost/demoness"" type look, which would be hard to make into an recognizable office ""boss witch"" crossover. 

We do have the word ""witch"" or ""wu po,"" just like we have the words for Santa Claus, but as a Chinese person, I don't feel bad about the lack of representation because it's not really representative of anything for me culturally

[Some of my favorite fox fairy ""witchy"" looks are from Painted Skin I and II](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=Painted%20skin%20movie&amp;rs=typed&amp;term_meta[]=Painted%7Ctyped&amp;term_meta[]=skin%7Ctyped&amp;term_meta[]=movie%7Ctyped)

Depends psychopaths I think are really more considered as “less developed” than sociopaths. A sociopath can fit in better in society and blend in. A psychopath would have more of a issue with that and also have very poor self control so they would have a criminal record mostly. Not always though but just my 2 cents.

"Late, but i can chime in. Technically, they're sort of right. It really depends on the reason why an application is denied but in some cases it would be accurate. USCIS can deny a case without requesting more evidence. USCIS can also refer a case to immigration court if a case is denied and removal proceeding could begin against the applicant and they could be deported. That is all technically true. 

In practice it would really depend on why a case was denied. Ill give some examples but they are obviously non-inclusive. 

Examples 1: someone files by themselves without legal representation and doesnt provide the right evidence, or forgets a form, or sends in the wrong amount for the filing fee. Almost surely, they would still get an RFE (request for evidence) and have to send in what they were missing. But even if they had horrible luck and their case was denied without an RFE, it would most likely be denied and thats it, and they could refile and spend the filing fee again. Its techinally possible that the abovementioned things could happen, but in reality it is very unlikely and that persons most likely wort case scenario is that they have to pay the filing fees again.

Examples 2: Someone files by themselves and is confused bu the phasing of questions or forgets something about thier past, or erroneously thinks that its ok to leave of some pertinent information. So say like they answered that they entered the country one way but really they entered a different way. or they dont put that theyve been arrested or deported because its been a long time and they think that it doesnt matter anymore. This could be a problem and they could have their case denied and referred o immigration court for removal. 

Hope this helps. "

"To me it came down to learning.

In ma2 I wasnt learning much. Its a bunch of guys who are trying to do too much and comes down to who shoots themselves in the foot the least. I didnt feel like i was getting any better.

When i jumped up to Ma1, i started seeing people playing smarter, and learning how to play within themselves. I learned SO much my first ma1 round, and applied it round 2 two to climb back into cash. It was where i belonged.

This was my second full season in Ma1, and i really came into my own with learning who i was as a player. I learned what I did well- and started putting myself in a position to do those things as often as possible. I started understanding how to weigh risk and reward. I worked hard on my weaknesses to get them to a ""capable"" place. Biggest skill i learned in ma1 is how to compete and succeed on a day when you dont have your best. Ive had a lot of lead card experiences, multiple top 5 finishes, and a win to my name. Best thing that happened to me was playing lead card two days in a row of an A tier and learning to deal with that target. Ive mastered playing within myself.

Once i get mt 12.5 points for am worlds, i am moving up to MPO. Im not sure what I will learn there, but I think the next step is going to be trusting my abilities to push those comfort zones. "

"Let me just share [a really interesting paper](http://www.toddkshackelford.com/downloads/McKibbin-et-al-RGP-2008.pdf) of hypothesized rapist ""types"".

&gt;Another type of rapist may be the specialized rapist. Men in this group are distinguished by being sexually aroused by violent sexual stimuli. These men may possess a psychology that produces differences in sexual arousal in response to depictions of rapes versus depictions of consensual sex.  

&gt;[...]

&gt;The existence of adaptations to rape does not mean that rape is inevitable or justified. Like all psychological mechanisms, rape mechanisms require functioning genetic and environmental components. Rape is only predicted to occur under specific environmental circumstances that activate men’s evolved psychology. Furthermore, because rape behaviors may have a genetic component does not mean that men cannot control their behavior. Just as men thwart their evolved psychology every time they choose less calorically dense food over more calorically dense food (as when one is on a diet), so too can men thwart evolved mechanisms that may otherwise lead them to sexually coerce or rape."

"I completely agree. If you go to a shelter or a rescue organization, you'll find so many wonderful mixed breed dogs that are just so unique and cool. Last week at the dog park, my dog played with this young female dog that was muscular and blocky in the face like a pit bull, but sort-of long like a dachshund with short legs. And she was blonde colored, and really fast when running around, she must have been around 35 pounds. Meanwhile, my dog is 50% beagle with a beagle face but a lean body and long legs, and he's like 40 pounds. 

So why would you pay a breeder who mixes beagles and pugs in their backyard and sells them for $800 a piece!? Literally everyone I know is obsessed with a ""puggle"", but that's just putting the high energy of a beagle into a dog with the compressed nose of a pug, so your dog will want to run like the wind but he won't have the nasal passages to breathe enough air while he's exerting himself. And everyone else is obsessed with ""goldendoodles"" because they want the loving nature of a golden retriever with the hypoallergenic coat of a poodle, but you honestly have zero idea whether your particular puppy will inherit a golden retriever's coat or a poodle's coat. In fact, the breeder who invented labradoodles said that he regretted creating that monstrosity. "

"Glad to see another happy PA-10 owner.  I love my PA-10.  It's a great gun that shoots everything accurately out to a few hundred yards out of the box.  I put non-magnified red dots and holos on mine and hit bullseye at 50-100 yards no problem.  If you bought it complete, don't screw with it.  It's fine as is.  To be honest, never understood why so many people put big mega scopes on an AR in the first place, and if you want to do that (meaning you want to hit targets at very long ranges), you should probably buy a higher quality AR anyways.  Not that the PA-10 is bad or anything.  Like I said, I love mine.  But if I wanted to hit bullseye at 800 yards (again, why would anyone buy an AR for that?), I'd probably custom-build AN AR in 6.5mm."

"My wife is divorcing me over much the same issue. She has put on over 100 lbs since our marriage, stopped shaving and showers whenever. She asked me about it and I was honest with her. It's more than just this, but that was a big factor in not finding her sexually attractive anymore. She is unwilling to change and insists that if I really loved her I would find her attractive no matter what. As it turns out, it doesn't work that way for me."

"So, I believe [this](https://www.guitarcenter.com/DAngelico/Premier-Series-SS-Semi-Hollowbody-Electric-Guitar-with-Center-Block-and-Stopbar-Tailpiece.gc) is the exact D'Angelico I have.  It's not the top-notch offering in semi-hollow bodies, more of a mid-range model.


For $750, I love the versatility. With a little bit of overdrive this thing sounds so rich and the different pickups give such a wide range of sound that I played with this guitar as my only electric for many years (after upgrading from a Squire Strat).  I have no complains on the sound or playability.


The actual body is lighter than I would have expected, so if you are looking for something really weighty in your hands maybe look to another model or company.  I went with the Stopbar tailpiece instead of the Stairstep tailpiece and I recommend the Stopbar over Stairstep because I noticed when I was playing both before buying that the Stairstep model was going out of tune consistently with any string bending."

"Don't use it incorrectly and I won't point out (respectfully mind you. I could have been a huge asshole about it, but I wasn't. Just keep that in mind) how it is that your exhibit of a principal is inaccurately used.

While the nuances of the principal could very well fall into place here, the multiple definitions I read it does not apply and is not listed. Ergo my conclusion.

Lastly, I have no idea who you're referring to with ""both sides"" memers, but I've been saying both parties suck for a half dozen years now. Neither side is helpful to the masses, neither side cares to reach across the aisle to resolve actual problems, neither side proposes a majority of bills to benefit all Americans in place of the monied interests they cater to, and I can go on. Point is while the GOP is bat shit crazy in their actions and have been for some time, Democrats aren't without their own skeletons in the closet. One can argue degree of responsibility  for the nations current predicament if they choose to, but I am not doing so here, nor will ever do so. I find it more beneficial to point out the wrongs both sides have made because both have wronged this nation for many decades. But apparently that's not something you cared to take into consideration before trying to lump me in with some supposed group of people I've never heard of and have no interest in being a part of."

"That's not true, I looked into using DAI for my business and the two law firms I consulted with were very clear that using DAI would be illegal and that DAI's legal status is that it's a security (at least in Canada, the E.U. and the U.S.).

The SEC has ruled that stable coins backed by actual U.S. dollars are not a security since they are fully collateralized and there is no expectation of any profit. With DAI, there is an expectation of profit since the token is structured in such a way that it pays a form of interest.

This makes DAI effectively useless for business purposes."

"The bolt release is probably bound up on something. I've seen this exact issue before. In my case, the pin holding the bolt stop in place was slightly oversized (or the hole was too small) which caused an unnecessary amount of friction that pressing the bolt release couldn't overcome. A few swipes with a file fixed the problem. You're going to have to go through everything step-by-step and figure out what's up. I'd start by taking the action out of the stock and checking if the bolt release moves freely. If not, then take the trigger unit off the action and see if it'll move, and so on and so forth until you can identify what's causing the issue. If that sounds like too much work, then bring it to a gunsmith."

"I've often noticed this year that the reports from people who were actually at a particular show differ wildly from how people *not* at the show perceive it.

-----

Kansas City really wasn't that bad (aside from the Uptown being hot AF). As I said on the night, literally the only people I spoke to afterward who were upset were the VIPs, not that I can totally blame them. A lot of newer fans were there that night and many of them told me they had a great time. No, I didn't talk to 2,399 people, but I certainly asked around.

As a multi-year fan but also my first live show, I personally was torn -- shocked by the new aesthetic, upset we weren't told ahead of time about Yui, but that takes nothing away from what Su, Moa, Muscle-Metal, and the Kamis did onstage.

That's also why I'm taking the whinging about these shows with a grain of salt."

"Maybe this is really informed by my experience, but... When I say the wait time isn't the biggest factor I mean that for many trips, ridesharing will always beat metro, even if the train/bus wait time is zero. Faster, less walking, no transfers, no waiting in the heat/cold. 

Like even bus ridership has been declining. Certainly the track work was killer (I had to deal with all of that in August too) but I think there are fundamental system problems beyond that.

And I say this as someone who doesn't have a car and supposedly cares about the environment. I do hope it gets better somehow, we definitely don't need more cars on the road, like you said.

No, really, he's actually a little better balanced.  Funny side note, I had to change the story from first-person to a third-person narrative to avoid having him read like a mentally disabled cyberpunk Eeyore. He's an aging private security contractor and high-functioning alcoholic with a  sob story and a victim complex to match. To that end, he's actually introduced at the beginning of the book gagging on a piece of expired canned potato, and the opening act of the story ends with several people dying due to his attempts to avoid being held accountable for a decision that he made counter to instructions given that conflicted with his conscience. Incidentally, he's also one of the two VIPs that the aforementioned supporting character is tasked with extracting in the scene described above. It's critical that he \*earn\* his badass stripes over the course of his story, because he has a fairly complicated character growth arc about assuming personal responsibility and accountability for the things in his life he has control over, putting aside his reticence about asking for help with the things he doesn't have control over, and standing up for his personal convictions against potentially dire consequences, to be spread out over a trilogy. Nothing really especially new or novel, I know, but I think I've got an interesting frame for it.  For this reason, he's supposed to be a slightly more colorful interpretation of the everyman figure to empower and inspire the reader to aspire to do great things regardless of their lot in life. "

"[u/villadejer](https://www.reddit.com/user/villadejer) \- I'd get the [$1899.99 CAD X-T3](https://www.amazon.ca/Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body/dp/B07H3Y9CJY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?m=A2671RLI74SBSD&amp;s=merchant-items&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540427224&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=hybrcamerevo-20) for 4k/60p 10-bit internal and the APS-C/Super 35 sensor. 

[Here](https://www.videomaker.com/article/c02/19251-understanding-bit-depth-and-color-rendition-for-video) is why 10-bit is important.

The X-T3 can produce video quality like this:

* ​[Fujifilm XT3 4K 60 FPS (24fps timeline) by Matt Brandon](https://youtu.be/FPf9p4cy3xM) (2160p)
* [​'A Memento of Life' teaser - shot on Fuji X-T3 in F-Log by Nick Thomas](https://vimeo.com/288574989) (4K)
* ​[X-T3: A Different Beyond trailer - Full movie coming soon / FUJIFILM by Matthew Libatique](https://youtu.be/qWhLu0TCHZY) (2160p - Libatique was the cinematographer on *Pi*, *Iron Man 1 &amp; 2*, *The Black Swan*, *Straight Outta Compton* and the upcoming *Star is Born* \[among others\])
* [FUJIFILM X-T3 Sample Footage by Johnnie Behiri](https://youtu.be/K4RutfSOzS4) (2160p - ungraded version [here](https://vimeo.com/288477136))

The X-T3 is also an impressive 26.1 megapixel still camera (please download sample images [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/utgcadd7n3hdkvv/AABlUBpnHTnODWA1G7tWFAx7a?dl=0) or see others in [this blog post](https://thedigitaltrekker.com/2018/09/first-look-at-the-x-t3-on-the-streets-of-penang/)).

The BMPCC 4K, on the other hand, is limited to 8 megapixel stills

The GH5 and A7 III have IBIS, but they're over $2000 CAD. 

And the A7 III can't record at 4K/60p.

Hope this is helpful and good luck finding the right camera for your needs!"

Look into cooperative care. 

[https://championofmyheart.com/2017/12/02/cooperative-care-for-dogs/](https://championofmyheart.com/2017/12/02/cooperative-care-for-dogs/)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pasT9FTGHo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pasT9FTGHo)

I train 'cooperative care' with my dog every day. He puts his head on a rolled up towel and gets a treat if he keeps his head there until I say YES. We started with just a split second of the head on the towel, then built up the duration to 5 seconds, then gradually incorporated me moving until I could walk around him - this took a couple of weeks. 

Then I added handling. At first just a light touch on the chest / shoulder. Then a stroke along the back. Then a light touch of the paw.... eventually  able to pick up the paw.... and working up to clip one nail at a time. The important aspect is: if the dog lifts their head, stop immediately. The dog is in control. Keep sessions short. If the dog doesn't want to work, you've moved too fast and he's feeling spooked. Always end on a really simple note, without any handling at all, for two repetitions. 

You can also try a ""nail file"" (sandpaper glued to a wooden board) or dremel which many dogs prefer.

 Like, I could *definitely* see Insomniac Peter somehow give up his super-powers to save someone or whatever in the third game and lose them forever and then focus on being a scientist and a dad and being with MJ and have Miles be the new Spider-Man. It'd be a nifty way of doing an Ultimate-y ending without killing Peter but also having the option for him to regain his powers again at some point, perhaps."

She is there with him, day in and day out, then some dude she doesn't even know comes sweeping into town and he ""mean girls"" her; drops her like a hot potato. Doesn't even consider that she might feel left out. Doesn't even consider that she might want to go. Doesn't even bother to talk to her about it. Instead of throws his hands up like he's a helpless victim.

Buying her own ticket and crashing the event would be a shit thing to do, especially if he didn't want her there, which I think is obvious he didn't.

He was purposely excluding her"

"z them, so basically minus the mean and divide by the standard deviation. as stdev is like root n, the amount of deviation that is tolerated for a as compared to b will be much less.

&amp;#x200B;

key formulas:

z = ( sample mean - target mean) / sample stdev of mean

&amp;#x200B;

note: there is substantial parameter uncertainty in asserting the sample mean of b = 4/14. but meh this will get you somewhere.

this probably isn't right or is right under certain theory but meh it will work, and at a certain point stats is about what works imho. it'd be something like what's the inverse probability of the event given a normal distribution approximation, given the prior that mean is 10% or something screwy.

&amp;#x200B;

it looks like you'll get into a loop estimating the sample stdev of mean without knowing the population of mean, so just assume binomial ( n = 14, q = 4/14 ) and approximate it with like variance = n \* q \* (1 - q) then say something like equating moments or something if asked."

However, I STRONGLY recommend that you go with a physical breviary. I started with Christian Prayer and it initially fit my needs. I eventually purchased the four volume set. I fell in love with the psalms and eventually started praying all of the Hours. It’s a hefty cost for a book set, but the office of readings really is great. You are getting a library along side your breviary. For a much cheaper route, you can do the Shorter Christian Prayer if you just want to get started on morning/evening prayer. For a lot of people, this is more than enough. You can also do the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The traditional version is a bit longer like the full office (from what I understand). The newer version is more like Shorter Christian Prayer. 

There’s also some other options that are more traditional, like the Roman Breviary or Monastic Diurnal, but you’re probably best off with the other options mentioned. "

"&gt; If you fall in to what I said, im sorry, I don't think you should have proportionate voice.

You talk about Voting and giving everyone a voice but you want to take away someone's right to representation based on their views; regardless if you agree with it is the fundamental point to be discussed.

You're stating on one hand certain opinions based on your view point should dis merit someone from being able to be represented.

Why should someone who disagree's with you, or anyone's opinion / ideal be not allowed to vote is oppression and waiting to slide down the slippery slope into dictatorship.

I don't believe someone raised to believe gay marriage is wrong based on their religion should be excluded to vote or have their opinion heard / taken into accord while making policy. 

&gt;Sorry 🙏 if you disagree, but that's okay. That's why we live in a country where we can vote.

You go on here to praise democracy to which it seemed you were pushing to revoke. 

Having people who are knowledgeable in certain areas is why politics work, when the people get fed up; they vote for change based on their ideals. Political parties cater to the most votes. 

As well it's funny that you're exactly worried about more blue party when the exact can be said about a more liberal (Not BC Conlibs) party being more represented, (NDP, Greens, independant)

It seems we disagree'd on who can vote vs who should be making policies to which I have to say in general it's a tough balancing act that neither party excels in, perhaps if we vote in Admiral General Aladeen everything can be Aladeen."

"So the physical starter pack (aka the pack that comes with toys) come with the following items:
1 pilot (Mason Rana), 
1 Ship (Zenith), and
3 weapons (Shredder, Flamethrower, and Frost Barrage)

If you get the switch version, you get two additional items
1 pilot (Fox McCloud) and
1 ship (Arwing)

To get more toys than what is available in the starter, you have to buy 1 of 3 types of toy packs: A: a pilot pack, which only provides an additional pilot character to use. B: a weapon pack, which provides 2 weapons. Or C: a ship pack, which provides a pilot, a weapon  and a ship.

The starter pack of any console is more than enough to complete the game, but not at 100%.The reason being is that the game has some items and checkpoints locked behind an ""elemental lock"" that requires a certain weapon type to open.

The weapons have 5 types (elements):
Kinetic, 
Fire, 
Ice, 
Stasis, and 
Gravity

The 1st three are available via the starter pack, and the other two are the only ones you need to buy elsewhere.

Now go back to my original comment and that will tell you which packs to buy to get what you need :)"

"Well, this is a really difficult question.  We would need to have some kind of contest, I think.  I'd have to see them all naked, decide who had the best tits, best ass, best abs, and best pussy.  I'd have to see who looked best in the oyster position, and which one did anal.  Any girl who didn't do anal would be really low in the rankings.

I'd then put each one side by side, and have them all masturbate at the same time to see who came first, second, etc.  Then we'd have the difficult part where the fucked each other in pairs while I watched and rated their techniques.  I'd put them on a timer and have them switch partners every 10 minutes.  They'd also have to rate each other after that little orgy.

Only then could I make a decision like this."

"The question is whybother with that? In the 1750s it made sense to portray an idealised version of the human form because that's a notion that people wouldn't have necessarily seen expressed elsewhere. But in 2018 that same endeavour is more or less pointless. Everyone's already more than familiar with female beauty standards, repeating them for the umpteenth time is hardly a meaningful artistic expression. It's not saying anything that isn't already being expressed by like, half of instagram, or as mentioned, most video game fan art.

Far from defining an ideal, as baroque sculpture might have, it merely repeats an existing ideal — one that, what's worse, is defined entirely by a vulgar consumer culture that's more or less totally divorced from any kind of artistic ideal."

"Yeah I agree with you. Power creep isn't exactly a bad thing, provided that players have enough time to adapt to the new meta (especially if there's PVP). Since I am all F2P, some of the games I played creeped in so slowly that you only realized older characters are phasing out little by little, that's good since it gives players something to look out for. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, brave frontier (RIP) power creeps SO hard that when I stopped for about 2 months, my entire team was absolutely junked and a fresh account playing for less than a day have a team stronger than my previous team which I played for \~6 mths.

"It could be anywhere from 1-3 levels in my experience for the OC and Expansions. Which could be the difference between receiving a particular variety of spell or not. Whilst this is not enough to make a build 'unplayable', it definitely changes what they can do by the end of the game.

Granted, I wrote my post under the assumption that they would not be using companions or summons, which definitely effect how mages are played early on.

The melee mage can carry your through 'any and all rough spots' in the OC and Expansions as well, to be fair. Where it falls off is after level 28, so it's not something that I'd try on a level 40 PW. But it could well be viable for all the Campaigns and DLC's, even the ones that go all the way to 40 \[Darkness and Bigby Hands are still available for melee\].

Anyway. I realise DnD is not meant to be a solo experience, even if NWN did tend towards that with the XP gimps to parties \[both offline and online\], so I get why you think that the idea of a solo melee mage might be 'dumb'.

But hey: Personal opinion and all that. Depends what the OP is after at the end of the day. :)"

"Interesting video, and continuations are pretty cool! :)

However, he seems to over-complicate things a bit, for example, instead of using the continuation inside the lambda passed to `call/cc`, he does this dance of returning the continuation, then immediately branching on whether it's a continuation or not that got returned.

Also, in the thread example, he chooses to immediately run new threads on creation; instead of this, you can just push the new thread on the thread list. This simplifies the implementation, as there will be a single place where thread switching occurs (in `yield`) and thus a single use of `call/cc` is sufficient.

Here's my take on that example:

    (define thread-list (list))
    
    (define (thread-new thread-proc)
      (set! thread-list (append thread-list (list (lambda (x)
        (thread-proc)
        (thread-run))))))
    
    (define (thread-run . cont)
      (if (null? thread-list)
        #t
        (let ((next-cont (car thread-list))
              (next-list (append (cdr thread-list) cont)))
          (set! thread-list next-list)
          (next-cont #t))))
    
    (define (yield)
      (call/cc (lambda (cont)
        (thread-run cont))))
    
    (thread-new (lambda ()

He’s also extremely haughty and he’s not even discreet about it which, as I projected onto Hajime while playing, just comes off as insulting. But my biggest problem with him is &gt;!his murder!&lt; which was one of the most boring and predictable in the series for me (although I guess that doesn’t entirely fall upon Gundham as it is mostly &gt;!the motive’s!&lt; fault he was still the one written into it when pretty much any of the other characters in that situation would’ve made it more interesting) &gt;!The motive put people in a position where someone would have to be a murderer (so not even a will they/won’t they situation like normally) leaving it to some of the most aggressive to end up being the killer this time. It was pretty clear even before anything happened that it would be Gundham because he was the only one who didn’t have enough personal development up to that point or a strong relationship to Nekomaru (who was also an obvious victim because of his almost death in the last chapter). Plus the whole “he and Nekomaru fought for their right to live” at the end felt like a cop out to try and keep Gundham innocent and hero like despite the fact that he murdered someone.!&lt; I feel like I’m leaving something else out of this but I got too worked up writing it to remember "

"&gt; If you think that abortion is wrong even when the mother's life is in danger, I don't really know what to say. That's like saying you are obligated to take a bullet for a stranger next to you and not doing so is murder.

I think I agree with you (wrt life-saving procedures), but those two things are definitely not remotely equivalent. Because a mother bears a responsibility towards her unborn child far exceeding the responsibility that strangers have towards each other.

&gt; Even the Catholic church's official stance is that abortion is permissible under those circumstances.

The Catholic church's official stance is that it might be permissible (by double effect) to save a mother at the incidental but knowable expense of the unborn child. I could be wrong but I would doubt that you could find any official admission that abortion is ever OK, because of the powerful connotations of the word.

It's sad but words have meanings beyond what they mean."

"Repair did not work. Gif attached of what I'm experiencing. Basically when I'm in game or at the desktop (example here is in game), I'm completely locked out of editing the profile no matter what. It just reverts instantly back to my desktop profile.

Once I was able to somehow rage click it fast enough that I could edit the gaming profile and change the keyboard color as a test. Even then, when I launched the game, the keyboard flickered back and forth quickly between my desktop profile and the game profile, mimicking the software as seen in the gif.

I've never seen this behavior before, and it makes core functionality of this software beyond frustrating. I guess a reinstall is necessary at this point, but as you can see, I have a few profiles and don't want to lose them.

I hope you can tell what's going on in the gif. The behavior is not 100% consistent, as you can see when I click on my Arma 3 profile, it appears to work for a second, but then fails. When I click on my Deus Ex profile it more consistently fails.

"My understanding is that Roman is not the CEO but is in some sort of leadership position in the corps. He will hold some position with the corps in the long run but I don't know what. As for why Albert said otherwise I don't know; you should ask him.

  


I'm not fully up to date as I haven't seen video of the alumni meeting yet and I have very little influence over anything going on. If you want more answers or want to comment on the future of the corps, you should talk to the IBoD directly.

  


What I do know is that the alumni are usually split around 50/50 on their views of the future of the corps but are nearly 100% in support of Albert. Even if they are somewhat concerned about his history, they think this way of bringing up concerns was wrong and are supporting him. I appreciate you trying to help the corps but pushing issues like this will only harm the corps and unite the alumni in support of the board. If you have concerns you'd be better off bringing them to the board directly."

*""During the Civil War (1917–21), the Bolsheviks adopted* [*War communism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_communism)*, which entailed the breakup of the* [*landed estates*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landed_property)  *and the forcible seizure of agricultural surpluses. In the cities there  were intense food shortages and a breakdown in the money system (at the  time many Bolsheviks argued that ending money's role as a transmitter  of ""value"" was a sign of the rapidly approaching communist epoch). Many  city dwellers fled to the countryside – often to tend the land that the  Bolshevik breakup of the landed estates had transferred to the peasants.  Even small scale ""capitalist"" production was suppressed.* 

*The* [*Kronstadt rebellion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronstadt_rebellion) *signaled the growing unpopularity of War Communism in the countryside: in March 1921, at the end of the* [*civil war*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War)*,  disillusioned sailors, primarily peasants who initially had been  stalwart supporters of the Bolsheviks under the provisional government,  revolted against the new regime. Although the* [*Red Army*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army)*,  commanded by Trotsky, crossed the ice over the frozen Baltic Sea to  quickly crush the rebellion, this sign of growing discontent forced the  party to foster a broad alliance of the working class and peasantry (80%  of the population), despite left factions of the party which favored a  regime solely representative of the interests of the revolutionary  proletariat. At the Tenth Party Congress, it was decided to end War  Communism and institute the* [*New Economic Policy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economic_Policy)  *(NEP), in which the state allowed a limited market to exist. Small  private businesses were allowed and restrictions on political activity  were somewhat eased. ""*

"Since EoC, I don't believe that there is a difference between weapons in terms of base dps. Cbows give you access to enchanted bolts, which have special abilities. Dual wield is generally preferred for abilities, because of Needle Strike. Chins give you AoE, which is otherwise severely lacking on range compared to mage and melee.

As for picking one combat style as your main, you will find (especially at your level) that you would be better suited using the style that your specific enemy is weak against. You will have better accuracy with a t40 melee weapon than a t50 range weapon if the target is weak to range. "

"When would they adjust the dollar to UEC value? I'd rather they worked on mission payouts and hooking them up to the dynamic economy first. I'd rather they get Hurston in there and start to balance the difference between a 20 second QT trip and a 10 minute one. I'd like them to get salvage in there and balance that against all of the above - if the price of ships is so high, is salvage pretty high too? 

I'd like to see if they are going with a rental system too which people could more reasonably do within a patch cycle.

I don' think they can address the purchased UEC value until we have a better idea how the rest of the economy is going to go."

"As JCJ2015 said, I dont think, that it is coused by food, too. It seems, that you eat very carefully. Maybe one year ago, I had heavy training. Everything was fine, until I sat into the car to drive home. I started to stop seeing a things, had a headache and felt very sick. I couldnt reach my home and had to stop at my parents house. There, I was pretty close to vomiting. Had a big headache and inside the house, it was very hot for me. Outside was 10°C and I fell a sleep there anyway. After 1 hour, I moved inside and slept there for another 2 hours. Than I was fine and drove home safely. When we expelled water, food and sugar, my instructor, told me that it could be bad breathing during the training. Many people just forget to breath and run out of an oxygen very quickly. Now, I try to focuse on it during heavy parts of my training and it has never happend to me again. Tray it. ... just my experience. Good luck!"

However, she fell through and now I'm scrambling.  I couldn't find an appointment with another prosthetics makeup artist this late, but I have found a simple 45 minute makeup appointment to bring it together.  She doesn't do prosthetics though.

Can anyone find any sort of latex bug eyes or other insect like mouthparts that I can attach to my face along with the makeup?  Any other accessories?

Passing on my genes has never been an end goal and its certainly not an accomplishment to be praised for. I can form human connections but I am limited to who I care to connect with. Also there is nothing wrong with being bitter about certain things. It's a natural response to facing injustice. If you want to learn something from the experience and live with avoiding certain relationships that cause these bitter experiences - is the 3ducat3d decision to make. Am I bitter right now ANd all day. No of course not. But there is nothing wrong with experiencing those emotions and learning from them.

"The healthcare industry is a bloated one filled with a lot of intervention from governments and special interest groups. The amount of corruption currently in the system will not lead to a fair industry where I believe libertarian ideals would be effective. Single payer healthcare seems like a good idea but it’s just adding fuel to the fire  in terms of cost. 

Insurance companies are where I believe the problem starts. Hospitals and medical practitioners bill out as much as they can knowing most insurance companies will fork over the money. If medical services were available to be shipped around then the whole system would improve. 

Think about it, last time you had to go to a doctor or hospital for a non life threatening situation did you ever discuss any pricing before a service was performed? If you asked any doctor or medical practitioner about the cost of a service they have no idea what it will be. It’s really remarkable. "

I use it myself when I need to nap and hubby is taking care of baby so I dont wake up at every sound she makes.

"Go for a stock a4 or a6 instead. You will save money and probably find one that was used a little less enthusiastically. And if the engine is in good condition, its easier to tune. The rest of the drivetrain is pretty robust and all you might need to spend on are those parts that wear down like shocks, control arms etc.

Even the base Audi models provide better performance as compared to base American or Japanese cars (unless you pick one of the performance brands like Cadillac or Lexus).

The other option is to look for a diesel variant. The torque on those are phenomenal. "

"Yeah that is what I am talking about as well. I have been served some food that was just obivously lazily thrown together from people who either were not properly trained or just don't give a fuck. In the restaurants I worked at, where profit mattered, the manager would fix that shit real quick and fire the shitty employees. We also got paid pretty well if we were good though so that made us feel more respected, etc. 

Still I hated working in restaurants and wouldn't go back to it unless I had to, but I wouldn't serve a salad with the disproportions I have gotten, cold/undercooked meat, sandwiches that are falling apart, etc. It's a point of pride for one and we had motivation to not get fired.

I also used to work for the old Tiger Dining regime under Bill Sallustro and he tried to alleviate this somewhat by bringing in privately run resturants (Philly Connection, Amsterdam) where the owners would actually care about the quality, rather than the cookie-cutter establishments the new regime seems to prefer. Lot of issues that need ironing out from a management/executive perspective.

And to clarify, I don't care if the people at the register are rude to me. I care if a spiteful kitchen worker messes up my food(or an untrained worker) and just says, ""fuck it that's good enough"" with no reprecussion or anything."

"Rafaela is my fav hero,  and I will tell you why I don't use her in Rank (Legend) except if there is no choice (last pick,  there is a tank,  heroes banned or taken, no magic damage). 

She lacks a reliable skill that people want.  You can be an absolute beast and kill with her, you may be able to hit everyone with your ultimate,  *but your team doesn't know that.*  They only see Rafaela's skills and they are not sure how she would contribute better than Angela or Diggie. 

However,  she should be perfectly acceptable as a last resort pick. Too many players for someone to play a hero with no practice.  

Also she is good to accompany Martis,  Grock or high damage melee characters IMO.  She also reveals Nat and heroes hiding in grass.

In this case, the DWL is created by a negative externality that is insidiously spread out so it's really hard to notice locally and in short term – but we are starting to realize on a global long term scale it's most probably an enormous cost and risk."

"There is nothing logically inconsistent with it. In order to be inconsistent, caring about species A should logically imply that you care about species B. Being upset about the suffering of some animals or even some species does not imply I'm upset about the suffering of ALL species. One can, for example, care about humans and dogs but not about snakes, cockroaches, coyotes, lions."

"&gt; You know what OP meant

Are you sure? Nuclear fuel in a game, nuclear fuel in reality, can be confused, can't they? Maybe I knew, maybe I didn't. A game is unrealistic by itself, why should a comparison with something that exists in reality imply the constraint of using it as it's used here instead of in a different way?

Not to mention (even though I *do* mention it now) that OP was factually wrong, even if you let the implication of it being jet fuel in the tanks fly.
[The ~~energy density~~ specific energy of jet fuel is 42.8 MJ/kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density), while [an A380 holds 253983 kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380). 42.8 MJ/kg * 253983 kg = 10.8704724 TJ

The 10.45 TJ an inserter can transport is a little ***under*** ""the energy of the maximum fuel an Airbus A380 can carry""

Probably has to do with the shitty responses they get whenever they misunderstand something. Ease up on the aggression and stop assuming that someone who doesn’t understand you is actively trying to hurt you. Believe it or not, the overwhelming majority of people don’t go around thinking about trans issues every day. 

I’m one of those people and I have stopped inquiring. I’m a relatively smart straight white male, and I really have no idea what trans means, and every time I ask (very politely), I am met with unnecessary aggression. And I really don’t care what trans means. As long as you don’t hurt someone else with your beliefs, do whatever you want, and marry whoever you want. 

I agree it should be illegal to discriminate against someone based on their status as a trans person, even if I don’t know what it is. I’m confused about it, I think a lot of people are caught up in gender hysteria in our culture, and a lot of people are born with the feeling to make a big change. Cool. Let’s make it illegal to discriminate against you if you’re trans, and we can all move on with our lives. "

"I've always found the anti-union sentiment of U.S. programmers to be absurd.

The main drawback of unions is that they acknowledge commoditization of the work. Once the unions come in, you're no longer a rock star artisan working for passion; you're a worker trying to get fairly paid. Fair enough. But let's be realistic about the status of the typical tech worker, as things already lie.

The bottom 99% of tech workers:

* have minimal control over working environment. Privacy-averse open-plan environments (back-door age discrimination) are the norm.
* work under infuriating, infantile micromanagement frameworks that have them interviewing for their own job (""standup"") every day. 
* don't get to pick and choose projects within their companies.
* get no investment in their careers from their employer. 

Their work is already commoditized! Unions will just make commoditization fairer. They'll come in and say, ""No, you can't fire this person based on your bullshit 'story point' mumbo-jumbo."" And if your employer illegally fires you, they'll help you in court. 

Honestly, unless you're a protege on a fast track– dead sure you'll be executive management within a year or two, because the CEO is grooming you for leadership and has staked his professional credibility on you– then you lose *nothing* by unionizing and you're a bit of an idiot if you don't. "

There should be no reposting of any kind on Reddit. If you repost and it can be verified the post should be removed and you should be stripped of all Karma that post made. You’re arguing that some reposting is okay. I’m saying it isn’t. You are in favor of some reposting and I am not in favor of any reposting.

"&gt;Prices are based on what people can afford.

I've seen it happen locally, where I live in Utah. know a few people who bought older homes, a decade ago, for $150-200k. prices shot up dramatically. *on paper*, or *hypothetically* the house is now worth almost twice as much. but the market for $180k houses is very different for the market for $400k houses. people who can afford $400k are more likely to want newer than 40-50 years old and willing/able to pay $500k in a different end of town. anyone who could have afforded $200k a few years ago, is now priced out single-family homes and are getting condos in that price range. 

I know a handful of those who bought the old house, upgraded the kitchen and bath since 2016 thinking it was a foolproof money tree. now, the market's going stale. open houses where *nobody* shows up. price cuts, incentives ... bupkis. panic and desperation is setting in. "

"Again, thanks so much for this! But maybe you can enlighten me...the title of the YouTube video says that Katya is using her “Maureen” voice. To whom does this refer? Maureen O’Hara? Maureen O’Hara is automatically who I associate with the name Maureen. But additionally, I referenced the podcast YMRT because I was getting Old Hollywood vibes—think Myrna Loy, Katherine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, and other actresses who clip their syllables. 

Edit: this is the first time I have ever been downvoted in my time on Reddit. I wasn’t allowed to watch “modern” TV, when I was growing up, so I revere all of the actresses I mentioned. I was just hypothesizing that maybe Katya was paying tribute to these late, great women. If you disagree with me, please educate me, as have u/heavyblossoms and u/sniffymom!

"Most people in America don’t have a copy of their birth certificate lying around and it can be difficult to get one if your parents are not around/unwilling to help, not all IDs are accepted and republicans have a history of crafting voter ID laws to target specific demographics, also IDs cost money and poll taxes are illegal.

If the government wanted to provide easily attainable voter IDs to everyone free of charge that would be one thing, but it would still be pointless because voter fraud just doesn’t happen enough to change any outcomes because it is so high risk low reward, in presidential elections they usually find 2-5 in the whole country (mostly conservatives who have been told it is such a huge problem that they feel they have to).

Edit: also what about the homeless? You need an address to get an ID and while a lot of people treat them as less than human they are largely citizens and are supposed to be guaranteed the right to vote."

"I'm going to tell you a secret, no one learns to program through a class, they learn by having a problem to solve and looking the solution up online. That's not to say that that university isn't useful for other reasons. I have a degree but I never took a class for coding at all, I taught myself completely through books and the internet.

Classes force you to learn and are good for people that aren't able to motivate themselves. If you can figure out a way to motivate yourself, you won't even need them. If you do go to college, you'll be ahead of everyone. Start small and reward yourself with every little victory.

"Not sure if I count, but here's my 2 cents. I have a few female friends I am very close to due to a mutual acknowledgement of friendship. What changed lately is how I approach women in general. When I was a bit younger I talked to girls who I found a romantic interest in based on looks usually. Now I talk to girls based around how pleasant they seem in the personality department. From there I get to know them before having any real idea of a relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is because I screwed up royally with a friend by coming on a bit too hard and ultimately causing her to alienate her from me. Years later learning she is pretty anti-social and rude to people she can't get anything from based of a few \[female\] friends who live around her. Back to the main topic; since doing this I have found the type of women i talk to has increased. I like to make jokes, get them to laugh and enjoy their time around me simply to build trust. 

&amp;#x200B;

Romantically I am not terribly interested in anyone right now since I am still a busy student who works part-time. I plan on seeing where the many girls I talk to leads beyond friendship, but am quite happy where things are at right now. Like other viewers have mentioned, I'd really suggest changing your views in the last two passages of your post. Go in without any expectations and gain some experience with talking to women. Test the waters and how different actions lead to different results. Also try to understand things from their point of view may help change your approach. If a lady figures you're talking to her as someone seeking friendship she may in turn be more willing to talk or hang out with you. "

Condemn the sinister act of terrorism and violence and encourage sensibility and reason among our conservative circles.  Conservatives can't be held to blame for this in the same way democrats can't be held accountable for antifa, the risin stuff, people rioting in democratic states after Hillary lost etc etc.  This is a serious issue and I see us moving backwards to a time when assassination, rioting and disorder was the norm and actually encouraged.

"Precision in your shot wan't the problem the over power was it moved the landing point of the ball which had a different roll out.  If you had moved the landing spot around you would have seen the ball guide wildly change from small movements.  You know how sometimes you are lining up a chip and the ball guide goes from the hole to way back erratically, that's because undulations in the green will cause the ball to check up and stop.  If you would have moved the landing spot forward you would have seen the ball guide shrink.  I always move my landing spot around 1 square for those shots just to be sure."

"It's most likely an unholy trifecta of extreme brand loyalty, one-sided perspective, and 'us vs. them' mentality.  


Once upon a time, my friend told me that being *overly enthusiastic* about something is not a good thing. He is right. r/android is one example of what would happen when you put a bunch of enthusiasts into the proverbial room. When you are embroiled deep into enthusiast things, then you'd forget the laypeople's wants and needs. In this case, the sub seems to want everything to be just what they perceive to be the 'perfect' phone - which is either no-compromise device like the Note 10, or budget flagships with mad specs like the Poco F1. Hence, they perceive the Pixel to be awful because it does fall into neither. Then add some petty fanboy bickerings among fans of different brands (which I presume to also include Pixel users - hence the Google fanboy comments), and we have a receipe for a disaster. Or at least that is what I understand.  


Surely, it is nice to be able to discuss details about your hobby, but it's rather unfortunate that those discussions turn into hostility and repeating things that had been discussed before ad infinitum. As an Android user, it is honestly pretty embarrassing and disheartening to see the communities around it turning into one that greatly resembles rabid sports fans. I mean, damn, isn't (or was? idk) *device diversity* one of Android's point?

""The device that went to CNN’s offices **arrived by courier**, a law enforcement official said. However, it **still had half-a-dozen first-class postage stamps** on it.""

""A law enforcement official said the devices were made with a 1-inch-by-6-inch length of PVC pipe filled with suspected pyrotechnic powder and broken glass to serve as shrapnel. They had a small button battery with a digital clock as a timer and a hot bridge wire initiator, the official said.

The devices **contained some of the components that would be required** to build an operable bomb, but law enforcement officials **would not say late on Wednesday whether they were viable.**""

""Some **bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested that the bomb sent to CNN had hallmarks of fake explosives** — the kind more typically depicted on television and in movies, rather than devices capable of detonating.

A digital clock was taped to the middle of the pipe, a feature that experts say is typically shown on fictional bombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension, but unnecessary in real life."""

"&gt; Opening the door to business. Closing the door to young people.

???

That is a strange argument. Creating new jobs and a healthy economy PRECISELY helps young people!

What young people need are JOBS! Openings in their field of work!

There is nothing worst then for a young person to graduate only to find there is no job open for him in the economy.

From the article as well:

&gt; Days later, the Tories suspended any new emergency needle exchange programs

So, apparently, the Star believes ""Young People"" are mostly drug addicts.

This article makes it's point really poorly. 

""Young people"" aren't a simple group of drug addicts who need massive social benefits to live.

And ""Old People"" aren't a simple group of businessmen with cigars who dont need social benefits because they make money with their EVIL businesses!

The Star lives in an unrealistic black or white world.

The reality is that a business friendly environment helps everyone by creating jobs. Young AND old!"

Moreover, there is the DMCA safe harbor.  This was put into law to allow internet companies to act as platforms for content without being automatically accountable for that content in the way that a publisher is.  However, if these companies are *publishers* rather than platforms, then they *are* accountable for the content.  If they are censoring the content, then they are acting more like a publisher.  At which point they lose the safe harbor provisions.

The situation is much more complicated and nuanced."

Instead, consider healing yourself by going deeper into your own pain. I’d suggest you see a therapist weekly if you don’t and grab a used copy of Pathways to Bliss. The way to doing is to first be at peace with simply being. I’d like to see you get better and enjoy a long happy life, not bury the depression under tactics.

Unfortunately, despite WaPo's nice sounding headline, what got actually put in is, of course, pathetically weak tea. It isn't just that it isn't enough, it's that it does *nothing*. Pension and infra spending, and that's it. Nothing about better wages for teachers, nothing about more focus on IT courses for school kids and better resources in schools, nothing about prescription drug prices, nothing about controlling the substances, nothing about better wages. Nothing about the working class (Which is what the program was first aimed at, to try and counter Trump's populism and flirt back a lot of disaffected Bernie voters).

This is because it got attacked as being ""Racist"" upon launch because it dared to help the working class, particularly the working class in the rust belt, which is predominantly white.

Every time.

"I don't know... My thought process goes like this. Aegon the unworthy legitimized all of his Great Bastards, giving them the ability to actually claim the Targaryen name. Daemon Blackfyre could have named himself Daemon Targaryen. 

But, Aegon had also previously given Daemon the sword 'Blackfyre'...the last physical connection to Aegon the Conqueror, with the Conqueror's crown being lost. 

Daemon was also Targaryen on both parental sides. No watering down of the Targaryen blood through outside marriage. I think it was purposeful on choosing the name 'Daemon Blackfyre' that he was saying, I'm the most Targaryen Targaryen since the Conqueror himself."

"I think a big part of it is that, though difficult to play, the game is pretty conceivable to a non-gamer.  The guns sort of work like real guns, the cars sort of work like real cars, it's meant to represent reality even though it isn't necessarily realistic.  There's no points, no complex goals, you just need to stay alive and shoot people who try to kill you.

A problem I've noticed in a lot of gaming that is more fantastical, when you talk to non-gamers, is that they really feel a need to imagine themselves in the situation to make a connection with the game.  Well, like I said, PUBG is pretty easy to wrap your head around and is somewhat analogous to a situation that they can imagine themselves actually participating in, at least conceptually.  So, without the feeling of disconnect from the ""gaminess"" of a game's mechanics, they pick it up better, both mechanically but also on a level of emotional investment.

The pacing and dichotomy of slow vs fast options, and the sudden shifts there, is also a really good point though.  PUBG can be a very social event as you're often ending up hanging out for 80% of a map while you actually wait for something to happen, if that's how you play it.  You're just chilling and chatting with your friends until the hype moment actually happens.  It's like hunting or fishing in terms of pace, and lots of people love that element of those activities."

"While I respect &amp; see your concern, I disagree with you on giving limitations to artists and their freedom of expression and monetization of music through modern technology. I shouldn't be restricted to give any of my sounds away and there are no statics out there that show samples reduce gigs or jobs or payments for musicians- if anything, it creates more. More songs that use brass sounds = more awareness of brass = more songs in top 100 with brass = more performances of these songs live = more gigs for musicians. Happy to continue this conversation with you in a private message. As soon as you produce a value property - such as you doing a specialty job like trumpet, you create a hierarchy. The problem with a hierarchy is that it produces inequality which produces resentment (and I can imagine you see this being a top 1% world renowned trumpet player). Do you view your prominence in the orchestral world as taking away gigs from other players? No, you are the best for the job, so you deserve, and get that job. In fact, you inspire others to want that job and create competition and inspiration for others to follow in your footsteps, to have composers commission works for you, for composers to make prominent trumpet passages in new compositions so future generations can play them, making the field of trumpet more prominent and competitive. If one person hears a sample in this pack and it becomes a billboard hot 100 song and 10 more people pick up trumpet because of it- my job here is fulfilled. No one is not getting paid or not get a gig because of this."

The article is a list of voting records in regards to border-control laws, if you vote for, you want sealed borders, if you vote against, you want open borders.

This means if a Democrat supports DACA and a path for citizenship, they want open borders.  If a Democrat opposes indefinite detention for asylum seekers, they want open borders.  If a Democrat opposes long-term imprisonment of unaccompanied minors, they want open borders.  If a Democrat opposes separation of asylum seeking families, they want open borders.

And how I needed to do it as soon at 8 weeks (cue eye roll). Well she got pregnant about 6 months after me. When my son was born she would constantly ask about when we were going to sleep train and how important it was. Well she had her baby and she now is quickly realizing how she hates to hear her baby cry and how she feeds her whenever she cries at night now (baby is 7 months). I joked about how her before she got pregnant was all about sleep training and now after she had the baby she realizes it’s harder that it seems. Her response was “I don’t need to sleep train because she slept through the night before 4 months.” In my head I just thought “that’s not what sleep training means.” "

"In traditional applications, yes, it’s unsafe.  I don’t think it will be used that way.  It would be a nightmare to insure.  You’re basically begging for lawsuits.

"They’re trying to exist. Nobody’s trying to debate you. 

People need to get over this tacit narcissism. You aren’t actually that important to everyone else.  Nobody needs to go out of their way because you make it difficult for yourself to understand other people’s situation. In the end, why should anybody care what you feel about it? 

In the end, you’ll end up “pretending” just like you always end up waiting your place in line or cleaning up in the kitchen. Once this sophomoric YouTube “rationalist” phase passes, it’ll end up just being a matter of basic respect for others. "

I have lived and spent time on three continents, dozens of countries. I am a dual national (so I do have choices, currently from 20 countries or so where I could live), i speak multiple languages and I chose Baltimore. On purpose. 

We have our version of issues and tragedy, for real,  but I feel like one thing we cannot give away is hope: its the root of the issue with young people here. They have no reason to hope, and we who can need to help them find some. It should be a human right, and poor people have to fight for it all over the world. 

I guess this is a long way of asking to try and not give up on Baltimore and keep fighting (unless you are already in Nirvana of course).

"`yield` is a way of getting a function to return a generator, that is an object that you iterate through to get all the values.

E.g.:

    def range_example(n):
        i = 0
        while True:
            if i &gt;= n:
                break
            yield i
            i += 1

This function `range_example`now returns a generator. That generator yield `i` each time it is iterated. `i` will start at 0 and increase by 1 until it reached `n`, and that will be the output.

You can automatically iterate through a generator using the for loop:

    for x in range_example(10):
        print(x)

Or you can manually call `next` on a generator to get the next value:

    to_ten = range_example(10)
    print(next(to_ten))
    print(next(to_ten))
    print(next(to_ten))

Note whenever you use the yield in a function forces that function to return a generator, you can no longer return a ""regular value"".

Another way you can use yield is get your function to return a coroutine, this is basically the other way around and kind of considered bad practise and you should now use the `async` keyword to produce co-routines. But let me give you a simple example:

    def coroutine_example():
        while True:
            foo = yield
            print(foo)

You can now ""send"" values in to the coroutine:

    print_what_i_send = coroutine_example()
    next(print_what_i_send)  # Need to do this to ""get to"" the first yield value

    print_what_i_send.send(10)
    print_what_i_send.send(9)
    print_what_i_send.send(8)


Hope this helps you understand yield a little better. In your case you need to spend a bit of time really getting to grips with how `ijson` expects you to interact with it, I don't have any experience here sorry. Parsing heigherical structures in this iterative fashion is hard work, which is why you don't see the approach in general cases in Python but only for high performance stuff (and those cases it’s often written in c).

"No….it's because it's obligatory to conceal sins, especially ones you've repented from. All of the scholarly evidence is on that side and the other side has nothing but emotions, strawman arguments, and random hypothetical scenarios they don't like! 

&gt;The only people in the sub who say that are the ones that ACTUALLY have some serious sins they want to hide

There is no real proof for this statement. 

&gt;If they didn't have anything serious to hide they wouldn't start arguing in the first place. 

Nobody would have to argue if people didn't keep suggesting others to do categorically haram things like revealing a bunch of past sins. I imagine plenty of people who don't have ""serious"" things to hide are doing little more than correcting islamic guidelines and fighting off the deviants. A lot of people seem to just completely ignore the impermissible aspect perhaps because their true concern is their own desire for background information that they don't really have any right to obtain. 

Sins a person commits aren't really transgressions against a future spouse they haven't met yet, they are transgressions against God's law. Try to realize that telling people others not to conceal is in itself a sin. It's not like a bunch of shameless sinners came up with the rules on this. Some people say outright they would rather just disclose things but they are not allowed. "

Here’s my take. Ramsey could shut him down. Could. But volume is going to win for the stat line. Jags offense is wretched. Awful. They won’t be able to keep their defense off the field. 
"First half notes:

First time I've seen Kawhi dive on the floor. And he did it twice. I'm pretty sure he's bought into this team at this point because he is playing outta his mind. 

Norm, dude. Yes. He's doing exactly what we want. Shoot the open 3 when it's there but attack the basket. I mean, this is excellent. Take CJs minutes because at this point he can build a house the big bad wolf couldn't huff and puff down. 

Offence looks so so fluid with the starters. Even when Kawhi is doing his iso thing, there's still movement and cuts. The defence is the defence. They are doing their thing. 3 point shots are falling but it's not like they're uncontested. Were doing fine. 

Lots of silly turnovers. Gotta clean that up. Good first half overall. Bench gotta clean it up. Interesting to see what nurse does in the second half. "

And everyone writing a new post to say what’s obvious, because what’s obvious was meant to look stupidly obvious, for a group that should be distrusting of MSM, this group agrees with way more of their pushes than what i feel is healthy therefore I feel this area is monitored and manipulated, and done so easily"

I had also seen the other article posted here recently that mentioned the vast majority of measles cases in Europe being in Ukraine, a country that has had recent civil war and conflict on top of an already poor healthcare system. Other large portions of the cases are in places like Romania with, unfortunately, some of the worst healthcare in Europe and poor remote populations.

Im not sure what any of this has to do with anti-vaxxers. Infact, the articles themselves dont mention anything about anti-vaxxers apart from in the editorialised title. An annoying side effect of r/worldnews that many European issues get quite quickly spun into barely related American agendas.

"&gt;Oh so he's a bit like Neville Chamberlin, then, in his desire for peace. appeasement and brushing things under the rug.

Neville Chamberlain allowed Germany to violate Versailles repeatedly without sanctions. They created the Luftwaffe, Britain did nothing. They expanded the Wehrmacht far over the 100,000-man limit and created armored units, and Britain did nothing. Germany stationed troops in the Rhineland demilitarized zone, Britain did nothing. Germany annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia, Britain did nothing. Chamberlain said there simply wasn't public support for economic or military sanctions, so why bother.

Russia violated a cold war-era arms treaty, Congress wrote up sanctions, and Trump signed them. Trump sent US troops to train with the Poles, and approved a massive arms package for Ukraine. Compare that to Obama backing out of a defensive missile deal with Poland, and directly telling Putin he'll be more flexible after the election.

&gt;but it was definitely a blunder because the Israelis aren't the only people with ideas for Jerusalem, it was a provocative move that does nothing to engender peaceful resolution to conflicts there, and really gained us nothing, but cost us even the final veneer of being a neutral arbiter for the region, thus decreasing our influence, and therefore, power, in the region.

This is a fair point I think.

&gt;Trump needs to recognize who our allies are. He praises dictators and insults allies. That is all that needs to be said about his foreign policy.

You have to consider Trump's negotiating style. He praises people when he wants to get something out of them (like in the case of North Korea) and takes a cavalier attitude toward people that are looking for something beneficial out of him. He flips the strategy based on the situation--when North Korea was testing nukes and facing total isolation, Trump had no problem calling Kim rocket man. But once they got on stage and Trump was looking to have a productive meeting, that's when the nice guy Trump came out.

Now that might be appropriate for a corporate boardroom where deals and acquisitions are negotiated, but it's not always appropriate in diplomacy. I don't like how he's talked to Canada. I don't like how he asked the French president ""why don't you"" leave the EU, even though I don't like the EU.

But it's not like our allies always treat us great either. Germany has been neglecting to pay its agreed-upon amount into the NATO budget and has said that they no longer recognize the US as a superpower."

Title: **Military pay and divorce - ex falsified court documents**

Original Post: 

&gt; I think my ex falsified court documents for our divorce proceedings since I wasn't in court.
&gt; 
&gt; Background : divorced three years ago
&gt; We were married 11 years
&gt; I was in the military for 24. 
&gt; 
&gt; When we got divorced I moved across country before it was finalized.  I was very distraught and upset over everything I moved away.
&gt; I couldn't be there at court for the finalization... But I trusted her because all the documents from me were notarized.
&gt; I never received a copy of the paperwork...I pretty much just paid whatever she said.
&gt; Yes...I am dumb...I was also pretty hurt and just didn't care.
&gt; This included her getting half my retirement from the military for my life. 
&gt; 
&gt; Three years later, I'm getting my shit together. I want to buy a house. I finally got a copy of the decree.
&gt; I noticed a lot of writing that was added to the papers after I signed them.
&gt; I noticed some of the papers were not the ones I had notorized.
&gt; But what got me was the one for military retirement was signed in my name by someone other than me.
&gt; I didn't sign it... The signature is close, but not right 
&gt; 
&gt; So my question is what do I do about it?
&gt; Even if it turns out it was falsified, am I stuck paying her anyway and then having a legal bill to boot?
&gt; I'm pretty sure she did it, but don't have solid proof other than I can say for sure it wasn't me.
&gt; Do I hire a lawyer and sue her... Do I press criminal charges?

"On racism. 

I find that those in the democratic party persistently push a racist agenda that may be as harmful as those in the republican party.

For example: Democrats push the [School to Prison Pipeline](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-school-to-prison-pipeline_us_5798fcd3e4b02d5d5ed3ea38).  This is incredibly racist. They claim that black kids who get trouble in school are going to become criminals in life. 

They took action and ""went after"" urban schools that service many black students, undermining their teachers and principals. 

This claim was made while the number of [young, black men entering college was skyrocketing and the number of young, black men going to jail stayed stagnant.](https://www.acenet.edu/the-presidency/columns-and-features/Pages/By-the-Numbers-More-Black-Men-in-Prison-Than-in-College-Think-Again-.aspx)  

[These claims were made even as prisons were closing down and urban crime index was in a nosedive.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/)

The Atlantic piece doesn't really give an answer to why crime has dropped but the answer is simple: Generation X teachers took over the schools. They were better than any generation of teachers before. Education trumps (punny) crime. Chicago proves this. A few years back Chicago hired a piece of shit Broad Academy Supt. He closed schools in black and poor communities. Chicago's homicide rate took off. (Other cities with Broad Academy Supts did the same with the same result.) 

There was no reason for the claim. 

The War on Drugs continues to be supported by the Democrats. Every drug law (from the first to the last) has been aimed at minorities. This isn't conspiracy theorist garbage, it is real. No one fights the war on drugs in affluent, white suburbia. 

Democrats look at black people as a bloc of voters and pander to them. People are people, regardless of skin color. One black person does not speak for every other black person and you cannot extrapolate what one person said and apply it to the rest. 

This is just the tip of the iceberg. 

The three strikes law is pretty racist in how it is used. This was a Democratic party law."

" ""with an 8 year old child who is very clearly gender dysphoric, and I'm pretty sure this is what caused  ...""

&amp;#x200B;

My concern would be that given that you're saying you just picked this up recently, that you so readily have figured out whats wrong and whats causing further issues might be a bit premature.  It kind of sounds like you're already taking sides based of the parents.  But again, its new.  How do we know mom isn't just being 'presentation compliance' or otherwise performing because she knows you're observing?  What if she actually feels the same way as dad, but is better at hiding it?  I'd want to see how consistent she is with her attitudes and behavior over time, rather than just off the first impressions.  First impressions are important, but if you go by a notion of 'past performance as possible predictor of future behavior' even in the very least we'd have to say we do not have enough information to be drawing full on conclusions yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, what happens if it turns out despite being less tolerant of the gender stuff, the DAD ends up being the more protective/appropriate parent?  I agree its a tricky line, but it can be even trickier if we start drawing conclusions before the entire process is completed."

"""I try to make the most logical decision in every decision.""

I've read a few posts like yours and most of the people always have a certain common trait. 

They are all very independent and logical/calculated people. I'm also like that and have experienced the same experiences as you. I just don't feel that much emotion. I prefer to be alone most of the time, want to do things that I can do myself, and don't like relying on other people for anything if possible. I also try to make the best decision whenever doing everything and am usually always trying to be as efficient as possible. 

Not sure if this has anything to do with what you and I experience but maybe it does. Idk lol. 

I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts"

"Never? I'm gonna go ahead and guess that you don't know the right to vote has already been taken away from a portion of americans.

Anyway, it isn't a slippery slope. I'm not talking about people having their right to vote taken away just because they wore a color i don't like. And i'm not even talking permanently taking away anyone's right to vote. The second those people get help with their mental issues or are elevated as not having serious mental issues that need attention they'd get their right to vote back.

It's just that if they refuse they don't get that right because of how dangerous them voting would be. Right now all a politician has to do to get people to vote for them is make up a lie about all other political parties. Which contributes to the massive problems in america in big ways. This would cut down on that because politicians would know that if they make up any old thing and people believe it...they'd pretty much lose those voters for a time anyway. So it would act as a deterrent for politicians who infuse utter bullshit into the minds of people susceptible to it.

And again, would get them the help they need. So no, not a slippery slope. Or at least, not that i can see in any real way."

"You wouldn't even necessarily need to get rid of war mode. You could just add a mercenary mode that lets you toggle who, if anyone, you're hostile with when war mode is on (with a cost associated with toggling if it's too flexible by default).

Right now, the game does a *massive* disservice to itself with factions. It restricts who you can play with (with about 50% being off-limits full-time), what you can play based on who you want to play with (ie, if I want to play draenei, I can't play with my orc friend, and so on) and doesn't really come up with many compelling positives to offset that. I can't think of many other games that I play which have such an arbitrary and obtuse set of rules on how I go about my business with my friends.

All of that for a faction war story that's meaningfully relevant for one in every three expansions, and almost universally gets panned for its hamfisted storytelling and status quos that it cannot break. I'll be nothing but pleased if BfA is basically a last hoorah for the hard line between factions, and we get something more flexible in return."

Not a single one of your messiah Democrats condemned these attacks but, were quick to turn the narrative against Trump (surprise surprise.) The fact this has been upvoted so many times shows it's pointless to try and debate so just shut up and listen. While myself and fellow Trump supporters would defend you from being assaulted, you would not say the same about us. Trump condemned and called for unity EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THE BOMBS WENT OFF. No democrat was injured and yet, here you all are screaming we have a terrorist problem. We definitely have a domestic terrorism problem and it's being caused by Antifa/White supremacists.

Are you in senior year of high school or collage?
"If I was coming back from even 5 years ago, I'd say the biggest shift is towards immutable infrastructures and the cloud. Cloud is an annoying buzzword, but it's still something to come to terms with. It's cheaper in most cases than owning an infrastructure. It's also a shit ton of fun to tinker with if you like this stuff.

Immutable infrastructures means treating the entire computer stack as an artifact you can pass around, certify in different places, and roll out to do a thing. Treating infrastructure as code. Either VMs or containers. If it gets sick, you don't fix it, you kill it and deploy a new copy. This means decomposing big monolithic or complicated systems into small specialized parts that can be independently scaled. The trendy term from 5 years ago was microservices.

So instead of a website being hosted on a dedicated web server requiring care and feeding, you have a virtual load balancer instance sitting in front of a pool of web server v1 containers or vms serving the site off of some shared storage system. If a web server gets sick, you kill it and spin up another one in seconds anywhere in the world. If you need more storage, you just increase the storage volume. If you need to make a change to the website, you make it once on shared storage and its available everywhere. If you need more serving capacity you roll out more web servers and when you need less you tear them down. This can be done automatically (elasticity). If you need to change web sever settings, you build web server v2 and deploy that. All can also be done immediately using cloud providers, greatly increasing productivity. 

Learn cloud stuff. AWS is easy as hell to learn if you understand technology from a design perspective. Learn tools like terraform, packer, Jenkins, ansible, puppet, chef, openstack, vmware, container systems like docker, kubernetes, etc. Google cloud and azure are good alternatives too. You may even want to use multiple cloud providers.

It will never completely replace physical gear on site, but it definitely helps IT make good business cases and gives us a fantastic toolset to build cool things when maybe we couldn't otherwise justify costs."

"As a newer player and a more infrequent player, I like the proposed system. In addition, it seems super simple to me, but I may be underestimating - Chopper, please clarify if I am misrepresenting.

What this does is convert downtime to a resource. Every character starts with 30 days in their bank. Once they consume 30 days, they pay rent to refill the bank. To me, that feels like the whole system. GMP confuses it a bit, but not unsolvable.

As always, the devil is in the details, so I will take a shot at my proposal and answering some of the questions.

---------------------
**Goal**

This will allow structured progression, but doesn't pretend to care about linear time. Occasionally players will go much longer in linear time without paying for lifestyle, while constant players and participants can grow at up to 3x the rate of others to satisfy their growth desires. GMP dumping will still incur lifestyle costs by consuming days and be gated to 3x per calendar month.


**Basics**

All characters at creation start with the amount of downtime days in the bank as dictated by their highest starting lifestyle (values below). Once those days are spent, lifestyle must be paid to acquire more days as indicated by their lifestyle. Once you pay the next rent, you cannot retroactively go back and use days from the last downtime period, even if some were available. YOU MAY ONLY POST IN THE MOST CURRENT RENT THREAD - OLD ONES ARE LOCKED.


**Lifestyles**

Each lifestyle gives a different amount of days per payment, giving a reason to not just permanently loiter at squatter. An idea for rankings is:
* Street: 0 (life sucks, go rob someone for 500 nuyen ya goon)
* Squatter: 20
* Low: 24
* Medium: 28
* High: 32
* Luxury:36

While obviously not representing linear time, this gives a mechanical benefit for investing in higher lifestyles, representing more free time, better environment, access to more local resources, and more - people living the highlife can spend more time doing things other than working.


**Spending Downtime**

In the rent thread posted monthly, state what you spent your downtime on, the status of what you're spending on, and what you paid. You can have parallel training streams as indicated by RAW. You can spend up to 3 months of downtime per calendar month. You may only initiate once per downtime period and may roll for initiation increase in your post.

In addition, you should link your character sheet reflecting your updates.

An example:

Magisterio, the magician, has just been generated and has participated in 14 runs in his first month(!) leaving him flush with cash and karma to spend. At gen, Magisterio had a medium lifestyle, giving him 28 days in the bank.

His post looks like this:

-------------------------------------


Char: Magisterio

Lifestyle: Medium (28 days to spend). Cost: 0 nuten (starting lifestyle)

2x Attribute (3 weeks)
* Attribute increase (Phys) Body from 2 -&gt; 3: 3 weeks (21 days) - DONE and PAID 25 karma

------------------------------

His initiation result was 4 hits - Congrats on being a level 1 initiate! 

Magisterio's player has run SO much that he wants to advance some more, spending his ill gotten gains, so he makes a second post. His primary goal is initiating, so he leaves some downtime on the table

------------------------------

Char: Magisterio

Lifestyle: Medium (28 days to spend), Cost: 5000 nuyen

Attribute and Skill (14 days)
* Attribute increase (mental) Will from 5-6, 14 days left, DONE and PAID 30 karma
* Pilot Ground Vehicle, 0 - 1, 1 day | 1 - 2, 2 days | 2 - 3, 3 days | 3 - 4, 4 days = 10 days, DONE and PAID 20 karma


Ended Month training nothing


Initiation 1 -&gt;2, Arcana 6, Intuition 5 [Astral Limit 7] : Target 2 hits [[11d6&gt;5]]+/u/rollme 

-----------------------------

It rolls, Oh no! Only 1 success. Magisterio needs to run more to acquire more karma and money before spending more downtime. He begins applying. As he hasn't paid for another month, he still has 14 days of downtime remaining in this month (and 4 days of skill training in alignment with the will improvement if he was particular), but couldn't attempt to initiate again. 


---------------------------
**FAQ**

&gt; How does this interact with training multiple things at once?

Continues just fine, explained in the post. The player should know what can work concurrently and other posters should help monitor them


&gt;  If a mage initiates and later on decides they want to boost some skills and buy some stuff are they sol?

Nope, they're limited to once per paid lifestyle iteration, but can continue to consumer their downtime piecemeal as long as its documented.


&gt; How do you determine when things are training and when they end in relation to other things or is there effectively 4 side by side ""months.""

You explain it, but there are effectively multiple concurrent queues to manage for parallel training as from RAW


&gt; Can you ""prebuy?"" your months? 

In my proposal, you can only buy 3 downtime periods per real calendar month per character. This allows high play rate players (or high GMP earning players) to grow faster than the occasional player, but not 10-20x advancement by GMP dump.


&gt; This doc does not mention a limit on how much downtime can be bought at once, or if you can buy more than the amount of time your character has been on the hub.

In this proposal, slightly different from Choppers, you can buy more downtime periods than your character has been on the Hub, but only a maximum of 3. If I have accumulated a butt ton of GMP cause of my participation, create a brand new character, and go on my first run, I can dump my GMP on them, but only can go to 3 months worth of advancement. I will need to wait until next real life month to do it again.

&gt; This doc has no clarifications on the consequences of buying squatter level lifestyle for cheap, just to have the time.

The penalties (and benefits) of various lifestyles are given in the number of downtime days you get per cycle. Experienced runners with long karma cycles will be motivated to upgrade lifestyles to get more free time.


&gt;  It also doesn't cover what lifestyle you are considered to have during the current date, and how that interacts with the rest of the rules.

You are considered occupying the lifestyle of the last one you paid for, regardless of time


&gt; This document does not address how GMP dumping might be affected in reference to buying up a lot of downtime, then dumping GMP and Downtime.

This is gated by a maximum of three downtime cycles per real calendar month. You can progress faster, but you cant go from beginner to prime in one run


&gt; The downtime bought using this method may create situations in which the player did not have the resources at the time on the calendar that they are spending (which is how it works in the current system.)

This proposed system, slightly different from Choppers, only allows moving forward, never back. That should prevent the scenario of buying things with time before those resources existed.


&gt; This system will not be applied retroactively, correct?

No, that burden seems crazy on CCD. Once announced, give the group some lead time - current existing downtime can be spent as normal for the next 3 real months, of which they must start using the new system. All new characters not yet approved must move to new system immediately. All previous advancement prior to the change is handwaved away as good enough.


&gt; One will have to pay at least Squatter lifestyle in order to train, correct? Assuming that if you're on the street you don't have the time or resources to practice a new skill or hit the gym?

Yup. Street life gets 0 days.


&gt; How does this interact with monthly qualities? If I somehow build up like 90 GMP and dump it all into Karma, can I pay for multiple months of rent and pick up multiple monthly qualities all at once, or is that going to still be tied to one per calendar month no exceptions?

Youre capped at 3 downtime cycles per calendar month, so you can dump GMP and progress, but not an infinite amount.


&gt; This also seems to dissociate paying rent from running. This means that people can do multiple consecutive runs without paying any rent if they don't use downtime. If they are saving for a purchase that doesn't require downtime, this will basically eliminate rent as a cost they have to pay. It doesn't feel like a good balance change.

You're right, this does dissociate paying rent from running, as time is a bit fungible here, but that is intended. The primary goal is to minimize lifestyle pain to those who are most vulnerable, while permitting the high involvement characters the room to grow fast. A weak point is someone saving for their new Deltaware Wired Reflexes 3 could spend no downtime to keep as much money to themselves as possible, but this hamstrings their growth overall. In the current state, people can just GMP dump to buy the new fancy thing, or run 14 times in a month and be minimally affected by rent, so this change feels primarily like reducing the burden on the casual runner.

"Well I am absolutely not an expert, but I can tell you how I usually decide when to line break. 

One of the most effective techniques with line breaks is using enjambment (the continuation of a sentence over more than one line without ending a line with punctuation) to create emphasis on certain words.  
For example:  
I am telling you the definition of  
enjambment  
because you asked me a question.

See how that emphasises the word enjambment where if I left it on one line, the emphasis could also have been placed on definition and question. Its just a way of directing the reader's eyes to the places you want them to focus on.

Other reasons people might line break are for punctuation purposes. It can look neat if a line break occurs after full stops, rather than having the new sentence start on the same line.

Line breaks might be used if a person is attempting to keep certain syllable counts. For example, if someone wants ten syllables per line they would obviously break after they hit their quota.

Also, in haiku, a line break is very important. The purpose of a haiku is to compare two images, so it is important to line break in a way that complements the cut from one image to the next.

I hope some of that was helpful. At the end of the day, line breaks are largely intuitive. I would imagine most people line break when it feel 'right', as cliché as that is to say.

"The Devil's Rain (1975), with a star studded cast featuring William Shatner, Earnest Borgnine, Tom Skerritt, Eddie Albert, Keenan Wynn, Ida Lupino, and a very short scene (from before he was famous) by John Travolta.

The great thing about this film is it takes itself very seriously.

Two more would be:

The Keep (1983) - Directed by Micheal Mann (Miami Vice), starring Jurgen Prochnow (Dune), Gabriel Byrne (Hereditary), Scott Glenn (Silence of the Lambs) and last but not least, Sir Ian Mackellen (if you don't know then I don't know what to say that would help you).

This is a film that Micheal Mann is embarrassed to talk about, but it really is quite a trip, with Nazis and the supernatural, and, while some may debate this, IMO the luscious Tangerine Dream soundtrack really makes the movie.

The next is one most folks have never heard of - 

Eyes of Fire (1983).

Set around the time of the French and Indian war, some settlers (pursued by Native Americans and a jealous husband whose wife ran  off with a con-artist preacher) wander into a haunted valley near the Ohio river, and have to survive against an assault of Native American ghosts led by an evil witch-creature.

This one is really not bad at all, and I highly recommend it.

"Hey man,

Heads up for a long self-centered story. 

I had my first kiss and girlfriend when I was 19 years old (you are already leading by two years;)). This girl was everything man. I didn't really notice in the beginning, but she was so fcking amazing.. beautiful, smart, ambitious, sweet, funny, realistic, .. I can go on. We shared such pure moments. Then at some point we had a miscommunication, which I thought was not a big issue as I did not really understand how she had perceived it. Due to bad communication and that we were living a couple hours apart and only met in the weekends, I was unaware of the situation. At some point I realized how important this girl was for me and became aware that I truly loved her (also a first time). I wanted her to meet all my family and work on a future with her. Well, guess what. During this time she had the idea that I did not want to be with her and she was moving on. She met someone else. She texted that she wanted to talk.. 

Instantly my heart was ripped out of my chest.. I didn't want to hear it or have the talk. In a split second it was over. Even though there were a couple up and downs, the next one and a half year, unintentionally, this girl was the last thing on my mind before I went to bed and the first thing when I woke up. It drove me crazy, but I just sucked it up..

Then when I was working as a skiing instructor, I was living more day by day and she was less on my mind. Out of nothing there was this girl that was so interesting to me. I even tried to slow down things and not get serious with her, but everything was happening automatically. Before I knew it I was building a deep connection with this girl and was rarely thinking of the first girl. After more than a year I had a relationship with the ""new"" girl that was 1000x more real to me than the first girl.  

Point of this story: It is possible to get over someone.

Also I just realized this is the worst advice as I read your question incorrectly. I have no clue whether you should try to recover it or give it up. All I know is that you can do you and that is all you can do. You shouldn't try to get her for the sake of having her to make you feel good. She should want to be with you, without you making her want to be with you. Does this make sense? 

What do you want from her? Do you want her to be happy? If you have such deep conversations with this girl, does she tell you about all her deep troubles and about what she wants? Do you know what this ""ex"" means to her? Are you sure about what you mean to her? I don't know anything about the situation of course, just asking questions to maybe help you figure it out for yourself.

Most useless advice of all time: focus on yourself

Maybe this is my most incoherent comment ever, sorry for that. Goodluck with it all.

"&gt;Most linguists refer to the distinctive speech of African Americans as 'Black English' or African American English (AAE) or, if they want to emphasize that this doesn't include the standard English usage of African Americans, as 'African American Vernacular English' (AAVE). In theory, scholars who prefer the term Ebonics (or alternatives like African American language) wish to highlight the African roots of African American speech and its connections with languages spoken elsewhere in the Black Diaspora, e.g. Jamaica or Nigeria. But in practice, AAVE and Ebonics essentially refer to the same sets of speech forms. Here, we will use 'Ebonics' without ideological or theoretical qualification, preferring it to AAVE and other alternatives simply because it is the most widely-known public term right now.

These policies only affect women and will make life for persecuted women significantly worse and keeps them ignorant and in poverty while leading to widespread abandonment and murder of female infants.  Then in 30 or 70 years, there’s a giant need for us as breeding stock and we’re taken as sex slaves or sold at high cost to the men who can afford us.  Historical precedent.  Meanwhile in counties that aren’t primitive, women simply continue choosing not to reproduce in large numbers.

Maybe you consider that an acceptable cost.  I don’t.  I’m not willing to doom my entire gender for generations because someone who is well off enough to have internet access deems the earth needs it.

I’m happily child free.  I’m also pro choice.  Pro *choice*.  I have enough problems with the government deciding I’m too dumb to choose the best course for my body, and now they get to control pregnant women too?  Jesus tapdancing Christ.  Can I just trade in my second X chromosome for a gender that isn’t constantly having my genitals policed?

"So far here the facts: All the bombs appear to hoax devices that where never indented to go off nor were they constructed in manner that they could have exploded.  They're designed to look like pipe bombs without any actual danger.

So we're left with 4 possibilities: 

1) Someone is trying to intimidate a bunch of Democrat politicians but the lack of a note with the bombs makes that unlikely.

2) Someone is a total nut case who hates the Dems and thinks their non-functioning bombs will go off.  In this case it's very likely than an outside source provided the dummy explosives since the person delivering them is too crazy to make them.  Likely the target list was provided by the outside group as well.  Mentally ill people are easy to influence.

3) Total nut case who hates the Dems and thinks their non-functioning bombs will go off.  They don't because he's crazy and can't build bombs right.


4) It's a false flag op to neutralize JobsNotMobs.


Possibility 1 is very unlikely given the lack of a threat of some sort.  #2 is indeed possible since the FBI sets up similar sorts of Islamic terrorists attacks all the time.  Not that I'm saying the FBI set this up or had anything to do with it, it's just an example.  #3 is possible, but most crazy people can't focus long enough to build or distribute such devices in this organized of a manner. #4 seems the most likely to me, but #2 or #3 is quite possible.  

We'll know pretty quickly by how hard this guy is to track down.  If he's easy to catch, probably option #2 or #3 and more so if he kills himself before capture.  If hard to catch, #4 is more likely."

The killer feature of having an official Spotify watchOS app is that it would presumably not require your phone to play music. Then you wouldn’t require your phone for workouts.

"It’s not really capital “r” Religion that they push. The Big Book simply requires that the addict recognize the existence of a Higher Power. Not Jesus, YHWH, or Muhammad—just a Higher Power. I’m in N.A. and my Higher Power is simply Nature; my sponsor’s Higher Power is Math. BTW, AlAnon is part of the same 12 Step umbrella group that includes N.A. and A.A. There’s a reason that 12 Step groups require recognition of a HP and it’s not to push Jesus and church attendance. It’s because the addict is finally admitting that they have a problem and that everything that they’ve tried hasn’t worked:  they need help. In order to truly accept that help without battling, like they always have before, they must have **HUMILITY**.  And humility means admitting that there is some larger force out there that is *bigger than you*, hence accepting the HP. 

True and sincere humility means that you must admit that **you**are not “god”; that you are not so powerfully intelligent that you don’t need anyone’s opinions or advice. 12 Step is all about taking your ego out of your recovery—the conviction that you’re a Special Case, that what works on everyone else can’t possibly work on you.  There’s also the addict tendency to think that they are much smarter than anyone else about *their addiction*, which is why they always thought that they could simply stop any time they “really wanted to”.   Humility makes it so much easier to admit that you were wrong-headed, and allows you to own up to your huge pile of addict bullshit that you will carefully decommission by working the Steps. 

Lastly, there’s the aspect of the HP that reveals itself to the recovering addict who is practicing sobriety and working the steps:  the power of the whole 12 Step community and the resulting fellowship with other addicts that combines to create a positive force that’s greater than the sum of its parts.  

I live in SF, which is one of the most secular areas of the US, and Christianity is definitely NEVER pushed at any N.A. meeting I’ve been to. (N.A. and A.A. both follow the same basic structures and essentially the same 12 Steps.) However, I have heard of Bible Belt 12 Step meetings that end with the Lord’s Prayer, not the secular Serenity Prayer. I don’t agree with that at all, but honestly, it’s to be expected in such a dogmatically Christian area of the US.  So, your N.A./A.A./AlAnon experiences may vary on a geographical basis. "

"If it's new it's probably going to be cheaper in Toronto area. You just have to figure out if the savings are worth investing two or three trips up there to look at cars, and then pick it up. 

For gently used cars, or cars just coming off of lease that are only 3-5 years old, Toronto is probably also going to be a bit cheaper. It may or may not be worth your time to only save 1-2k. If you want a specific harder to find option or rare colour you may also have more luck in Toronto. 

For anything 5+ years older, or under 10k, it's going to be case by case and probably not worth driving too far. 

As far as fixing a car, why would you have to go to Toronto to fix it? Say you buy a Dodge, any Dodge dealer can do work on it under the warranty if there is one. If there isn't then it's your car, and you can get it fixed. For German cars, higher end cars, or simply rarer cars like Maserati or Alfa's you might have better luck finding parts and qualified techs in Toronto than in London. 

You could also buy your own third party warranty through an insurance company. 

In short, the newer and more expensive you're thinking the more worth it, it is to go to Toronto. "

"&gt; I agree that the meta is pretty healthy right now. It feels like I could try out any janky homebrew and do decently with it.

That's exactly why the game is at it's best right now, IMO. And personally I see no other way in which Blizz should really try to improve. Because fundamentally, that's the only reason I keep playing, and why this year I've actually played way more matches than I planned to. After I have been completelly appalled and fed up with HS. I'm not going to say that when quitting HS I knew I'd be comming back, but I did keep it as a possibility, because I remembered what they did to refresh the game with introducing Standard. And then by removing adventures -- that was actually the best part and the main reason why we have such a beautiful meta; many people do not appreciate that. And now I just treat HS as a nice game I have access to so that I can play a match here and there, between things, as it's meant to be played. Really.

&gt;Take MTGA for example: i dont know the size of their playerbase but they have 8+ game modes

To be fair, I don't know how MTGA is and all their modes. I just remember one game I played a lot -- DotA 3.7, a wonderful mod for WC3, predecessor to DotA Allstars, and then LoL and DOTA 2. It was a very difficult game, with a rather small playerbase, but you would be able to find a match almost anytime. Until someone came up with a mod to it, where players would get randomized abilities, and ALL the casuals went to play that.

So even when I hear about modes in MTGA -- I feel like they aren't really necessary. Just a way to trick people into thinking there's more content than there actually is. And, what's worse, taking away their work force from developing new ACTUAL content. What I think is -- some of those people should just go and play another game, there's nothing wrong with that. It's not like I care about HS so much that I don't want it to break, because frankly I will find better things to do, like not playing video games. But I think what Blizz is trying to do is keeping their original type of player, who came to the game for the simplicity, high quality (you've said it -- no other game matches this quality), competetiiveness, card collecting (huge accent on this), and card variety. I agree with their philosophy, their acceptance that players are suppoosed to come and go, take breaks, long breaks.

I'm also sure they will eventually, possibly during one of the rotation periods, introduce some other big change/improvement, but it will not have much to do with game modes. It should be something interesting, yet simple. Hopefully will have to do with removing Classic cards from Std. And things like that I want them to be working on.

Be honest -- how much interest would a tournament mode spark in you, or any other average player? 2-3 weeks of hype? And then what? Game needs card content, not placeholder content. I do notice that my friendlist is not as full at event times nowadays as it was late 2017, but there's still plenty people active in it. many of them, though, were very old players, as in they played since 2014/15, so it was about a natural time for them to quit.

It's really Ok, that people are quitting a game. Doesn't say much about the game, but about the players -- they've grown up. A new game mode is not going to keep them, when they found a girlfriend, or a job, or a real hobby."

Additionally, the current happy ones can bring in more customers through word of mouth, which is not only free advertising for the business, but way more impactful as well (in that said new customers already have a strong reason to stay and buy, before they even step foot into the game: playing with the friend that brought them in)."

"I have been in the same exact boat since D1. Like you said, anything that can 1 shot should require a certain level of skill. With snipers it is the need for precision and supers obviously make up for it with their rarity (though some of the exotics are getting a little crazy with the super re-gen right now in crucible). With shotguns that skill is getting to your target and that makes perfect sense. Destiny however has crazy movement options available to every character and I think what we have seen is that this is unbalancing the skill aspect of the weapon class. Removing the crazy movement kinda takes away what is special about the game so all that we are left with is reducing the 1 shot range to compensate for how easy it is to close the gap."

"&gt;I am not directly answering your post, but I would like to flip it.

Okay

&gt;It seems to me that Islam is the work of the devil.

Looking at Judaism the devil wants people to steer away from God. Jesus being God seem more like the devils work. If Islam was the work of the devil than He would most likely wanted Muslim to believe in multiple God (going against God 1st commandment) or made Mohammad part of God as seen Christianity. As far judaism is concern, Islam believes in the same God they do, whereas Christianity is questionable. Also consider a Jew can pray in a mosque, but would not pray in a church.

&gt;my christian perspective is that the Crucifixion and resurrection is the greatest underserved gift to mankind from God and changes everything. One of the key messages of Islam is to deny this.

The resurrection makes no sense you don’t have to be Muslim to understand this. Why would an all powerful God require sacrifice, He can easily forgive sin without a sacrifice. God sacrificed himself to himself, to forgive sin is illogical.

&gt;Multiple ancient sources report Jesus’ death by crucifixion, including Jewish, Gentile, and Christian records. These reports are so numerous and the surrounding circumstances so clear that even atheist and agnostic scholars say Jesus’ crucifixion is among the surest facts of history. The Koran yet written 600 years after the fact then denies this?

Quran doesn’t deny it, it states that Jesus wasn’t crucified someone else took his place who looked like Jesus, but crucifixion happened. An powerful God can do all thing therefore it wouldn’t be much of an effort to make someone look like Jesus. "

"I wanted to keep Özil rather than Alexis, but I wouldn't have been able to make a good argument for it without relying on sentiment and my personal preference. 

I prefer a team player over someone who shines more as an individual, so that's part of it. 

Özil was also our first big signing in the post-Emirates era, so he was symbolic of the club's growth and FA Cup success for me.

I was also a fan of Özil when he was at Real, and Real is one of the clubs I like the least. (I'm more of a Barcelona fan.) For years, Özil was a player that I just couldn't help liking even when I was rooting against his team, so when he came to Arsenal it felt almost like a wrong had been corrected. Real were easier to hate again with Özil gone. More importantly, he had come to Arsenal, a club that was famous for attacking midfielders who are real team players and often the best player in the squad. I really missed Cesc at the time (and honestly, still do, but that ship sailed long ago) and Özil was similar in many ways, so I was really happy to get him.

So when Arsenal seemed to be choosing between Özil and Alexis, I wanted to keep Özil, but I would've had to concede that there were probably all sorts of statistics for why we needed someone like Alexis more."

If you look at it another way, the federal government de-scheduling would not legalize marijuana in the states, and the federal government probably doesn't even have the power to force the state's to repeal their own laws, because there isn't a federal constitutional right to use marijuana.

"I agree.   
A) JavaScript IS INSECURE. You must use tokens for everything. And your token is also unsafe. For example, I am working with Google Maps, and I must expose my key!. It's insane!. Part of my code is behind PHP so it's safe from prying eyes but a portion of the key is revealed, and I can't do a thing to change it. What's a mess.

B) It's trivial to change the logic of Javascript, of course, you can't put your logic in the view layer but then, what's the point of VUE, Angular and React?.  How?. Key F12, put some debug.log('some variable') or you even modify the code.


C) Javascript screw your SEO. And no, Google supports only the basic features of javascript. SEO is clear about it, and it's clearly documented.  The classic example
&lt;a href='function()'&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; is not indexed.   

A site that uses Javascript is safe not because of Javascript but because of the server-side code (PHP for example).

So, can you do a fancy site without much Javascript?. Yep, it's called CSS and JQuery.

Proof, how to crack a javascript site (that's the entries points are not safe)?.  CURL.  Even a script kiddie could hack it.

But even that doesn't make sense.  If you think Steven and Brendan were mopping up blood, then you simply search the garage until you find the evidence.

The other thing that gives weight to your point is how the interrogators reject Brendan when he claims events happened on the side of the garage.  Why would the interrogators doubt Brendan if he claimed they attacked TH in any way on the side of the garage?  Especially if they had no evidence yet contradicting it?  Obviously, they had already built their narrative and needed Brendan to back it up."

"Anecdotally, you're doing it wrong. You can gain strength and cut at the same time. It won't be as good as someone who is bulking, but it can still be great. I was simultaneously at my strongest and lightest in Afghanistan. Also, keep in mind caloric density. You can eat to your physical limit with healthier foods if you have an intense PT schedule and eat healthy foods. My Afghanistan diet was 5-7 plates / day and I was consistently losing weight.

&amp;#x200B;

Or, as a civilian, now I can eat \~2.5 lbs food / day + 1.25 L of hard liquor a week, and as long as my food is healthy, I am constant weight / cutting at 3 hours / week PT + a standing job. Avoid high caloric density bullshit and you can eat right up to the point of physical pain.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, keep in mind that all 3 PT events are body-weight exercises. Once we get the dead-lift, big mother fuckers will get good numbers on that at least, but as of now, every pound gained is a pound pushed. It's worth it for muscle, but not so for fat."

For example, it's *possible* Spotify did hire the Snowy developer with the explicit intent of just shutting him down. I have no *direct* evidence to disprove that. It just doesn't make sense."

Like the Not-A-Flamethrower being a glorified blowtorch, designing a a submarine to save the kids trapped in the cave in Thailand, then accusing one of the rescuers who criticized his submarine of being a pedophile. Then there's the hypocrisy of him openly smoking weed on Joe Rogan's podcast while Tesla drug tests their employees. Some people see him as a visionary with his SpaceX and Boring company projects and like his off-the-cuff personality compared to your stereotypical stodgy CEOs, while others think he's an immature man-child with more money than sense."

"Windows! Or HP computers.

My HP laptop, I had just gotten a month earlier. Windows 10 decided to not work at all. I reinstalled. Eventually it did that again. Linux actually works to this day on that machine, never had hardware issues with it.

One day, less than a year of owning the laptop, the hard drive decided to kill 500 sectors. Yep, suddenly SMART reported over 500 reallocated sectors. I took this as a sign the drive was dying. (There’s even a Wikipedia page on SMART that says drives were much more likely to fail within the following months if they had any reallocated sectors.)

I contacted HP support and I was told to run a SMART test from the BIOS. Somehow the test passed. The person on the other end asked if I had valuable data on the drive, to which I replied no. That was the last I’d heard. 

The warranty was still in effect too, and would be for the next three months. It has between two months and one month left. I suspect the hard drive *will* die shortly after the warranty, though. 

Never again."

Really? I couldn't tell. C:
"Basically, a stable orbit close to Earth requires you to be going faster than geostationary speed. A stable orbit further out than geostationary requires you to be going slower than geostationary speed. There's an altitude sweet spot, and it's at the same altitude at which your orbital period would be exactly the same as the rotational period of a point on Earth. That's geostationary. Staying geostationary while close to Earth would mean falling to Earth. It's not a stable orbit, because you wouldn't be going fast enough to counteract gravity. Likewise if you try to stay geostationary too far out, you'll just zoom off into deep space.

The hypothetical satellite won't be able to get an orbit that exactly and perfectly resembles the model 'geostationary orbit'. The good news is that it doesn't have to be exactly perfect. As long as the orbital period is right there can be a discrepancy between Pe and Ap, or there could be oddities with inclination or whatever... the result would be it would 'wobble' around the point in the sky, getting further and nearer to the planet's surface, and other shenanigans, but it would still be stably in a geostationary orbit.

Except it wouldn't, because there are other effects at work up there in space as well. Tiny tidal forces would drag it away from its average position, other planets would pull it, as well as the Moon, the Sun and even distant stars. So even if it were possible to get a 100% perfect exact geostationary orbit as per computer models, that would soon drift, too. Then as the years and decades pass, it would gradually leave the geostationary orbit."

"You dont seem to understand the difference between biological sex and gender. 

Gender is a social construct. Now, that doesn’t mean gender isn’t “real.” Gender is real in the same way money is real. It has a tangible impact on our lives but it’s something we as humans created. 

Bitcoin behaves like money and you can use it like money so you know what? It’s money. We as society assign it value, nature does not. 

Yes, you are born biologically male or female (though intersex people do exist) but the way we treat you in society based on that fact is a social construct we call gender. 

The idea that men and women must behave a certain way is an idea that can and HAS changed throughout human history. 

Gender is a performance. The philosopher Judith Baker outlined this concept back in the early 90s so this isn’t a new idea. 

If someone would feel more comfortable in our society being treated as a woman, man or even neither of those things we should respect that. 

Assigning arbitrary guidelines for behavior on a person based on circumstances of their birth out of their control is authoritarian. Thats why people think you’re an asshole. "

"""Each of Niall Greene's report cards told the same story. He was a good kid, fully capable—but his teachers always added a caveat: 'He's easily distracted.'""

This makes me very sad. So many teachers dread students with adhd and treat them like they are either delinquents or underachievers. Schools lack interactive teachers who are willing to work with mental health issues. I know it is not a teachers job to understand mental health and we already live in a broken system. However, it is unfair when in high school I felt ostracized by my teachers and peers because of a disorder that roughly affects 6.1 million children nationwide. I often skipped classes because I felt like I had nowhere to learn. Teachers talked amongst each other about me being a 'problem child.' Students bullied me to no end. At one point I was so depressed my BMI was almost under. I was so insecure, not about my weight or my body, but about the fact that I felt too dumb to accomplish anything. I hope teachers become more aware of adhd instead of ignoring it and sighing as their next student walks in with a note from their psychologist. We refer to high school as four years that shape us. What really bothers me about teachers is how they tend to focus on kids who do not really need their help. They would rather cater to those who already have straight as. Why is this? Shouldn't we help those who are struggling? Even in my language classes I would ask for after school tutoring. How is it that every french teacher was ""too busy"" to help me for 30 min after school?

So if any of you are teachers I hope the next time a kid seeks out help or talks to you about their adhd this article comes to mind. All it takes to help a kid with a mental disorder is thirty minutes of your time. Instead of overly praising teenagers who are on their way to a ‘better education’ help those who are fully capable of being there. Make sure they know that their disorder does not define their intelligence. This is something that took me years to figure out on my own.

"The Hebrew Bible is the basis for the world's two most powerful religions and one smaller religion, so I'm not sure how you could begin to argue it isn't reflective of anything meaningful. 

&gt;Um, what? How can you rape someone if they don't not consent? If there's no such thing as consent, there's no violation of consent, and therefore no rape.

That is correct. There was no concept of rape as a violation of a woman or girl's bodily autonomy and desire. Her consent was irrelevant. The violation was of *her father*, because he owned her until she was sold to her husband. This is why the ""reparations"" were extremely traumatic to the woman involved. Being married off to your rapist for continued abuse doesn't seem to help the rape victim, does it?

&gt;For the vast majority of human history, there WAS no voting. For the vast majority of human civilization, even when there WAS voting, most MEN weren't allowed to do it either.

The existence of oppression of poor men by rich men, or men of color by white men, doesn't disprove the existence of the oppression of women. It just means that there are multiple ways for people to be oppressed, and on the basis of gender is only one possible way. 

&gt;Both of those things are false. If you spent five seconds on Google, you could easily prove yourself wrong.

There were absolutely not (and still are not, globally) consistent laws against beating one's wife. The fact that some exceptions existed to the rule of women not being educated doesn't mean it's untrue that they weren't generally educated. That's like saying that because Frederick Douglass existed, slavery didn't. 

&gt;AKA not MALE privilege then. MALE privilege is something that applies to ALL males, not just rich, white ones.

Well this is just an easy misunderstanding of what people mean by ""privilege."" Privilege doesn't mean that every member of a group has a wonderful life. It also doesn't mean that men can't also be black and have to deal with racism, or disabled and have to deal with ableism, or gay and have to deal with homophobia, or whatever. It doesn't even mean that every man has it better than every woman. I'm sure Ivanka Trump has had an easier life than you. 

All it means is that people with a certain identity are generally making the rules (laws, corporate policies, papal bulls, decisions about what media gets funded, etc.) And because they are making the rules, they tend to make those rules to suit their needs and preferences. The trickle down effect is that things are set up to make life easier for people who share as many aspects of their identity as possible. So a rich, cis, straight, muscular, young/middle aged white man who is a citizen will have some advantages over someone who is the same in every other way but has the flip side of those identities. 

And to get deeper into the theory, what is actually happening is that society is arranged around serving an *imaginary* man. Sort of a godlike ""perfect man"" who doesn't actually exist. This means that no matter how close you come to the idealized identity, you still never feel like you measure up, never feel you have enough, never feel in charge. You may get certain advantages, but you're always focused on what you don't have, and always trying to tear someone else down instead of dismantling the unfair system. It's brilliant in an evil way. 

Anyway, again, the slavery example is relevant. I'm sure some slave somewhere was treated relatively better than some free white guy. But that doesn't disprove the brutality of slavery as an institution. 

&gt;Um, whut? You know that reliable birth control wasn't invented until the 1950s, right? Lol.

There are lots of ways to control fertility. Being able to say no to sex is one. 

&gt;Hardly. That's absurd.

Equally valid perspectives as a group. As in, a woman's perspectives is not automatically less valid simply by virtue of being held by a woman. 

&gt;There's no way that everyone is equally able and capable to contribute to society equally. 

Again, I'm speaking of groups. Women as a group have as much to offer the world as men as a group. They aren't inferior by virtue of being women. 

&gt;I suppose that depends on your definition of ""oppressed"", now doesn't it. Your definition seems to be ""not in charge of things""

Systematically not in charge of things, as a group, without good reason, in ways that cause harm without consent.

&gt;In the vast majority of societies for the vast majority of human history, women enjoyed a place of privilege and special treatment.

First, citation needed. Second, your argument earlier was that women choose their position and prefer it, not that men provide benevolent dictatorship. Third, benevolent sexism is positively correlated with violence against women, so I'm not convinced the ""special treatment"" of having a door opened for you counteracts the rape and stuff. 

&gt;Are female chimps ""oppressed""? I mean, do you HONESTLY believe that? If so, please let me know so I can simply ignore you.

I do not know exactly how we got to this point in the discussion, but chimps seem outside the purview of a discussion about human behavior. "

"Well, ""better"" could refer to any aspect of the game. 

* Gameplay-wise, TF2 was more fluid and responsive than Infinite Warfare. It still surprises me how much speed you can build up by skillfully chaining up different moves. IW' movement system was an upgrade over BO3's (which already was a huge improvement over AW), and is considered by a good part of the CoD community to be the ""advanced movement CoD"" with the best movement, but it still feels slow compared to TF2.

* Campaign-wise, both campaigns were quite good. TF2 explored the bond between a Pilot and its Titan, and IW told a story about a group of soldiers fighting in a sudden war and commiting their lives for the greater good. TF2 got more praise for it, and the IW one was also pretty good (the robots were the most human characters on both, BT and ETH3N were really good characters, an interesting coincidence between both games).

* MP-wise, TF2 had more attention and interest (also because it was the second entry in a fairly new IP and it was the first TF game to be on PS4), but a good amount of the TF community disliked the direction of the MP game design Respawn chose to follow for the sequel: a more pilot-focused, guns-up style of gameplay that many considered ""too CoD-like). And it showed: the most distinctive part of TF (the titans) was somewhat downplayed on TF2, and the MP experience became too similar to other games. IW, on the other had, already had the tried-and-true CoD formula (which some people also dislike), and as such the gameplay experience was more consistent, but it wasn't ideal if you didn't like that formula.

* Extra Content-wise, well, TF2 didn't *really* had a third/additional gamemode until the Co-Op free DLC was released months ago (and IIRC is still in beta) and it wouldn't be correct to consider the Time Trial scenario an additional gamemode, so in that area TF2 didn't offer that many options. IW offered Campaign, MP, and for the first time for Infinity Ward, Zombies. The Zombies mode was actually *really* good, and a breath of fresh air form the more quest-oriented map design that Treyarch was spearheading with BO3. Zombies in Spaceland offered a lot of things to do for both casual and hardcore fans, and the rest of the DLC season was also good.

* DLC-wise, TF2 totally had the upper hand. Free DLC without loot boxes and cosmetic-only MTX? Color me impressed. Although it was somewhat of a double-edged sword. The amount of free DLC was quite good, but I wonder how much content was left out of the release schedule because of the reduced revenue income that cosmetic MTX make compared to the predatory loot box system. On the other hand, IW had a Season Pass and Supply drops on top of it (although they were the most ""player-friendly"" of all of the SD systems in CoD, letting you unlock the base weapons via a challenge). Still, it had SDs, so it wasn't really easy to get the cosmetics or weapon variants you want.


All in all, I like both games and can appreciate their individual strenghts, but I still had more content and fun with IW, especially with the pretty fun Zombies mode. TF2 had a lot of promise, and the gameplay is engaging and really fun, but it also underdelivered on the MP department, which could also have had an impact in the game's sales (aside from Respawn's decision to release the game *in between* Infinite Warfare and BF1)."

"I'm not sure what it's like in your area, but for a bar you're likely to get a pretty mixed crowd. With that in mind, I'd say you should probably avoid lingering on Afro House for too long, throw in the odd track here and there to break up the Deep House sounds, but then mix back into Deep House. I love playing Afro House, but it can be a little bit too different to what people are used to if they're a more basic crowd. See how they respond when you play it, they might love it but I wouldn't count on it. I've found a more underground House/Techno crowd will be really receptive to Afro House though.  
The good thing about Afro House is that it's usually not super melodic and can be layered well with other genres. Choose Deep House that isn't too deep/minimalistic and with good basslines, throw in a little Afro House here and there and you'll be good! "

Just read up on what's needed or perhaps email the closest French consulate to you.  Note, if like Italy, sometimes there are smaller consulates more close to you, but only larger, regional ones can process a citizenship application.  Explain to them the basics, in details, and ask how to get your birthright citizenship recognized.  Once you get a list of all the docs you need, if they need apostilles, if they need translations...just make a checklist, and do one thing at a time.

"I'm not sure about this one. She's not quoting the material when she uses the word, according to the student, and she's been reprimanded for the *same exact thing* before. Whether or not she agrees with the department's opinion on her use of the word, she should have learned from her prior experiences.

That word has it's place in literary and historical discussions, but this professor should have used better judgment on how and when to make use of the word. Particularly in a social climate as tense as the one in which we live today, perhaps discussing the use of the word beforehand would have been appropriate.

At the end of the day, there was almost certainly a better way for her to get her point across which wouldn't involve repeatedly using a word that she's already been in trouble for using before and wouldn't involve using a slur that still carries so much weight.

And before anyone equates it to high school, no, this is not the same thing as saying the word when reading verbatim from Huckleberry Finn or Tom Sawyer."

"I would imagine this would depend on locality. In my hometown, the tracks that people used for walking along probably were private property, but there was zero enforcement.

"Something to consider for you both:  
It is standard for dudes to hit on us and continue to do so after we don't express interest or blatantly express disinterest, and a lot of dudes usually stop *only* once we mention a boyfriend - they don't stop just because we would like them to. Maybe we're trying to just shortcut to that stopping point. Or we don't want to accidentally lead them on (and oftentimes have them call us a b\* if we do, in which case we lose either way), so we mention a partner. It's not always about being self-centered.  
Or maybe a person's personality type is just one whose loyalty includes cutting off any potential miscommunications with another person who might theoretically be interested in dating."

"League Question: possible collusion?


Preface: I’m the LM and last week the league collectively voted as whole to automatically approve all trades between two teams. I think it was pretty understood that all teams would complete at least remotely fair trades (not too incredibly lopsided) obviously trading for needs sometimes creates some unbalanced trades. Anyways, now this week just a week after we passed that rule the Gurley owner (5-2 record) and first year fantasy player decided he would trade Gurley to the Bell owner (3-4) for Bell and.... Sterling Shepherd. Now since you can’t amend the veto feature in ESPN mid season I’ve been upholding every trade immediately. In this particular instance I didn’t and I allowed the league to vote. It was vetoed almost immediately. The league is now questioning our rule change that occurred last week, and the (3-4) team is furious that his trade for Gurley has been vetoed after we approved the automatic trade rule last week. The (5-2) team is also furious as he believes Gurley will be benched during the entirety of the fantasy playoffs and he believes Bell will return a better yield for him then. So my question is what do it do? Does this appear to be collusion? I love my league and league mates and I want to make an informed decision that is fair and beneficial to the entirety of the league without creating too much of a rift within the league."

"I agree and disagree with you. I agree that we need more tracks. There is a good selection but we need more. I am not a fan of fantasy tracks if their job is to be scenic, but they do have their place. 

Street circuits would be very welcome. Prague and Rio are alright at that but we only have 1 real street circuit(Long Beach) and 2 sort of street circuits (Le Mans and Bathurst). I would love to see Monaco, Surfers Paradise or Adelaide added (I am biased to tracks I know) to fill that void. 

GT Sport has a good list of tracks to it with regards to originality, but is missing a bunch of classics. I would love to see turn 10 go out and add more tracks like Intelagos, A1 Ring or Tsukuba, or even some tracks that we haven't seen getting any love in video games like Sepang, Phillip Island or Jerez.

More tracks is key for this game, but also locations. The tracks are very US centred and have little elsewhere. PC2 has a similar issue with the UK, and GT with Japan, so FM really needs to not have another American circuit added until they get a few more elsewhere."

"Google is more or less going to be your friend on finding deck archetypes.  I haven't seen an updated archetype list so I'll briefly touch on the ones you mentioned:

* Genn Greymane - You get a special upgraded hero power (costs 1 mana) if you included this card and only Even cards.  (Hence, Even Shaman, Even Paladin, etc).

* Baku, the Mooneater - You get a special upgraded hero power that costs 2 mana and is usually twice as powerful as your normal hero power if you include this card and only Odd cards.  (Odd Warrior, Odd Paladin, etc)

* Resurrect Priest means two different things for the Wild (all cards) and Standard (limited) format.  In Standard, it focuses on using the Priest Spellstone (Diamond Spellstone) and Eternal Servitude to resurrect big or important minions.  It is used with Zerek's Cloning Gallery as a potential OTK (Mindblast/Holy Smite) as well as increasing the number of high quality minions. (Malygos+Velen makes a 5 damage Mindblast into 20.  And Radiant Elemental reduces the cost of Spells plus you might have Coins from Gilded Gargoyle making this very doable)

"THIS CONTAINS A VERY IMPORTANT WARNING

I’ll say right now, having a loved one tell you that you should start exercising because you gained weight hurts.  My mom did that to me several years ago.  My partner agreed with her, saying I should start exercising, BUT he said it was a matter of him being concerned about my health, not my weight.

I won’t lie, I have a lot of issues with food now (it doesn’t take more than a few seconds look at my profile to see that), but i think if my mother hadn’t been constantly making commentary about my weight my entire life (whether I was too skinny or too fat or eating too little/much), a note of concern from my partner wouldn’t have resulted in my poor self-image. 

I would avoid the subject of weight, but focus on the health.  Being overweight isn’t healthy and can lead to medical issues down the road.  Let her know that you love her no matter what, and that’s why you want her to get back to a healthy weight, so you both won’t have to suffer later.

I’ll also add, exercising isn’t enough. It’s the diet that really makes a difference. Make a proposal to start eating healthier for both of you. Reduce the amount of high sugar and carb easy-to-grab snacks and replace them with healthier snack options. For me the issue was heavy snacking, and it’s the same with most other people struggling with weight. 

If you get her to successfully start working to lose the weight, although it’s not as common of an issue, I’d watch her carefully and be very careful about the praise you give. Depending on her genetic tendencies and past experience, weight loss and obsession over image can become very addicting, especially with society’s judge mental views of the female body. Let her know how much healthier she’s looking and how sexy it is, and never mention the word skinny.

I know this was a long comment, but as someone who has experienced a similar situation over the last 3 years and knows first-hand how easily it can out of control, I felt the need to share this and how to maintain a healthy mindset and enact preemptive damage control."

He is at least, for his wife’s sake, considering it. You have no grounds to try and persuade him further and the writing is almost definitely on the wall as to how this would play out.

Not everyone is flexible with their monogamy. You might just simply have to find a different kink for you to share. Your husband is clearly communicating his boundaries to you. You NEED to listen. 

Here’s a suggestion: go to a sex club with the explicit rule that you’re only playing with each other. It’s a super hot environment and you can be voyeuristic and get it on in front of people/watch people getting it on without having to share each other. 

Listen to your husband, he is communicating clearly with you. "

"If you're in a legal state, they're great bowl scrapers, too. Wipe off with rubbing alcohol to clean."
"I had this NPC. A young man named Haquim.

When the adventures were traveling through the desert, they stopped at a city undergoing a very violent power dispute. On one side there was the wealthy but shady merchant's guild, paying top coin for henchmen to enforce their status, and on the other hand a group of extremist sorcerers who believed in the supremacy of their bloodline (they were descendants of genies who helped the first settlers of the city).

No one in the party was aware, but the war priest witnessed a fight between the two groups and, when the militia rushed in, he managed to hit Haquim, who was involved, and got him arrested.

They heard that the boy would be sententenced to death and, after they learned about the dispute, they wanted to know his point of view, so the party managed to disguise themselves as clerics to hear the last prayers.

When they asked him for his motivation, Haquim made a passionate, almost poetic speech, telling the story of his people, all the hardships they faced and how each kind of genie helped them thrive. The speech was totally improvised, but it was very, very touching. 

It took minutes after it was finished before anyone wanted to say anything. I could see how the players were divided. They knew that he was an extremist who had hurt people and would do it again if he was released. But they were also moved by the poetry in his words and the passion he had for the cause.

In the end the party decided not to take sides on the conflict, because they could not agree on it. They decided to stand down and move on and let the locals handle their problems. Haquim was hanged, with no right to last words. And his body was left exposed as an example and a provocation for his group. That also shocked the party, because they're all waiting dozens of sorcerers to show up and rescue the boy, or some Deus ex machina miraculous intervention. But nothing happened. The boy died at the end of the rope. His body was left there to rot under the sun. The war priest that helped arrest him bought some bread and threw crumbs on the ground, so the crows would not eat Haquim's flesh right away. They decided to leave the town right away, so they wouldn't have to spend another night at the city.

This NPC made a very short appearance, but is one of the few that all the players still remember. The war priest swore to his God that one day he'd be strong enough to return and burn the city to ashes, for all the outrageous things that he witnessed there."

"A few reasons, 
1st and foremost is illness, Kids get colds, flu etc. ALOT from other kids at daycare.

2nd most daycares don't have just 5 other kids and as a general rule the food isn't magnificent home cooked healthy meals. It is more likely mass produced convenient food.

3rd the daycare provider does not give the same love and nurturing a parent does. They are trying to keep 5+ kids from destroying things and hurting themselves or others.

Caring for a child at home is definitely better than daycare when the family is able. If either  parent is unwilling or unable due to various reasons, daycare is an acceptable option. In general it is not a better option.

“In November of 2017, we received an email from an individual who claims to be a men’s rights activist. He reported that he emailed our general email line and was informed by one of our staff that the upcoming Women’s Beer Forum was for ‘women only.’ He then proceeded to demand thousands of dollars from us, while also threatening a discrimination complaint through the government if we refused to pay. Since he had never purchased admission through our online sales portal, we were unaware about his request to attend the Women’s Beer Forum. We apologized about the miscommunication and offered him an opportunity to learn about the same flight of beers provided at the event for the same ticket price. He declined the educational opportunity and instead filed a claim through the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH)."""

I get the financial reasons producers cast Scarlett Johansson, although I also understand Asian-Americans actors feeling like they can't get a shot to star in bigger movies because they haven't been given a shot to star in bigger movies-- it's a self-fulfilling cycle where you'll never have Asian-American stars considered big enough to ""launch"" a movie.  Crazy Rich Asians seems to have broken the logjam on that, though."

"Quake requires more strategy than other FPSs because the 'objective' on the map is constantly changing as items respawn. Knowing when and where an item is about to respawn (without any in-game timers available), your path to that point and the time it will take you to get there as well as the probable location of your opponent is what influences the moment to moment decision making in the game.

Map control and such is important in CS and others and has a large influence on the games but with mostly static objectives it just doesn't have the same impact.

If you look at [this game](https://youtu.be/8--FybgMgto) where the players are more evenly matched (also playing a different Quake game but whatever), it's a decent example."

If your team is organized, throw turrets in there and tell teammates to tele with you.
You can you the tele to turn the attention of torb and enemy sym sentry turrets while destroying them. 
You can deploy teles mid fights and go back and forth or use them as mini shields since they also receive damage. (Don’t stand in one spot Bc you can get sniped easily) when I tele up to kill a widow I’ll crouch or like move away really quickly from the tale to not get sniped.  

When putting up turrets, keep them high but also scatter them don’t cluster them. You want them to hit a target all together but from different directions to force them to destroy each individual one. Attack from the opposite direction of your turrets to get your enemies to back up into them."

And yet here you are.
"There is also the rules on ""shock from damage taken"" which will give anyone a minus on their next turns actions equal to damage taken (-4 max penalty) this hurts a mags worse since your archery is probably better than their spell+magery skill and you are probably tougher. Also I believe any damage or even a defense action taken by a mage during his casting turn forces a will check to  keep the spell (with any shock penalties or penalties due to fatigue loss of 2/3rds). All in all, GURPS rules can be included or ignored to get the feel the GM wants for his game so maybe  he just wants magic to be more powerful. But if all rules are in magic will be half the speed as stated by others above. You can also carry a lot more arrows than they have fatigue in a battle. An archer will have deadly accuracy for cheaper (mage needing IQ+Spell+Magery+innate attack to aim and an archer needs only DX+bow). Encumberance and even metal armour can negatively effect magic too optionally."

"&gt; the furigana over a kanji compound aren't even close to what they're supposed to be.

Uh, can you give us an example? 

If this isn't a case of you simply not knowing the kanji, there *is* a somewhat common-ish thing where the author will match ""wrong"" kanji to a word for artist effect - writing maybe [宇宙](#fg ""そら"") (poetically saying the ""sky"" is as enormous as outer space), or just wordplay - Franky in One Piece is referred to as [鉄人](#fg ""サイボーグ"") - the author wanted to use the word ""cyborg"" and playfully assigns the kanji for ""metal person"" to that.

It's relatively common in anime and manga and is just wordplay for effect.

Good for pretty much any trade but because their order entry system is not identical to TOS I would note the difference in if there's any pause or issue in placing orders and use discretion when you trade using RH;
 
They have so many newbie traders that they tend to have special rules for seemingly normal day trades. If in doubt, use a full desktop platform. Of course RH is going to offer a full desktop program soon so do what you will with that

I also have noticed that some stocks don't appear in RH versus full PC platforms, and of course RH has a weakened capability to do very complex trades; options are there but it's not the same as TOS. your call"

I'm of the mindset that when I'm angry about something I get through that anger as quickly as possible and try to move to the constructive phase where I try to fix the situation or at least come to terms with it. The ""Kicking people in the balls"" hyperbole might make you feel a little better in the short-term but it fixes nothing. Maybe it just means I'm a weaker person. I just can't stand being in a negative mindset for long periods of time. I used to be this way in my late teens and early twenties and it's brought me nothing but bad result. I try to control this.

"I think there's some truth in that.  And it's probably more likely now that right wingers to an extent feel vindicated by Trump's victory and that we've had two more years of him making violent, illiberal statements.  

That being said, it's an absurd reason (if that's your main reason) to like or hope for Trump winning.  

Polling seems to suggest right wingers are increasingly dismissive of democratic norms, when the norms fail to bring them what they want.  This is also increasingly being internalized by the people actually running things in the conservative movement.  Those are Trump people or followers, at this point.  There's an element of that on the far left too, sure, but there is a significant portion of ""moderate"" Republican voters that electorally stay loyal to the conservative movement that doesn't exist for the left, whose leadership and representatives are still mainly center-left.   Definitely a problem.  "

Send these pulses to a 4024 or other binary counter IC.

Then, send the output from your 4024 to a 4511 ""7 segment driver"" IC. Then you can connect the 4511 to your 7 segment display and get a score from 0-9. You'll also want a reset button (which could be as simple as briefly disconnecting the power).

As far as I've observed ""bad"" means, ""doesn't keep up with other weapons when speedrunning"". In the hands of an average player playing the game, chainblades are absolutely fine as long as you can get yourself accustomed to the iframes of the dodge.

&amp;#x200B;

When people refer to chainblades being bad, they are talking about the low HP damage it deals. This slows down kill time, and is the reason why you can get away with a part break/bladestorm build and practically break every part on a behemoth before killing it."

"You clearly assign quite a lot of weight to the animal traits - that's literally the definition and entire point of being a furry. The animal traits are central to the entire thing. I repeat: no matter how you choose to conceptualize it, *furries have an abnormal attraction to traits that are only exhibited by non-human animals.* It follows that furries are more attracted to animals than the average person, since animals are the only real-life animal that demonstrate the traits that furries fetishize...

The example of ""hung like a horse"" is not comparable at all - it's simply using a comparison to describe the size of a human body part. Someone who uses that phrase isn't expressing a sexual attraction to horse dicks, they're just alluding to the size of horse dicks to describe the size of a human dick...And I have never heard ""frisky like a fox"" before, but it doesn't sound like the saying implies in any way that it's normal to be sexually attracted to foxes... 

Edit: strictly speaking, I don't think there's anything immoral about the specific fantasy of an anthropomorphized animal. There isn't really wrong with “immoral” fantasies either, as long as you don't act on them. But if your fantasies become public, and if your fantasies disclose an above average proclivity for immoral acts, that's concerning. "

"Anyone who says, they're (currently) making a living off mining could be simply in the position to already have the hardware which is already paid

Anyway, I just made an example how much money is needed to make a profit, the cheaper the energy, the less upfront investment is needed, the faster ROI is hit and the hardware can be used longer. So it really depends mostly on energy costs.

As an investment it's dfficult. Mining may be a better investment than photovoltaic for example - but photovoltaik has less risk.

But I get your point - and you're right, hardware will need to be replaced to stay profitable - personally, I expect the next faster GPUs coming when 4k VR comes to mainstream or if AMD has some secret in the works (unlikely, because I guess, they already skipped the top tier market)"

Lets be honest, the only reason you are muslim is because you were born in a muslim family (how lucky). If Islam is indeed the one true religeon then going to heaven almost entirely based on luck. There are people alive and dead who didnt even know Islam existed and therefore are doomed to go to hell. Does this sit right with you? 

It is perfectly reasonable to argue that you dont know how life started. If you want these people to change their mind, you have to provide evidence of which there is none. I dont see any point to arguing about existance of god.

Also i disagree that evidence is in your favor as you are the friend asking people to belive in the example above. The other side isnt telling you to believe anything and therefore isnt required to provide any proof."

"I think part of that is that there are entire games telling people to use nothing BUT M4's and AK's which make people not only sick of seeing nothing but the M4 in their normal games but they are legitimately being told to use it period.

To be frank, I fucking hate the M4/M16  platform... I really do. Used the C7 and C8 in service and just pieces of... I probably should stop before I get downvoted to hell, but they're such crap platforms that are only still issued because of bullshit backroom politics and the fact a lot of top brass and politicians have their god damn pockets lined by Diemaco/Colt. We tested a- okay this rant is starting to go from airsoft to real life drama haha.

But yeah I think its the fact people shove M4's etc into peoples faces that they get such a negative look by a lot of people. Nothing is wrong with an airsoft M4/M16 as they have the same internals as most any other and there are just an overwhelming aftermarket for those parts so they are the easiest platforms to upgrade so they are the smartest by.

So it doesn't really matter if someone like myself get a little tired and have a bias against my old service weapon, you can't ignore how advantageous it is to buy the M4 platform as a beginner to airsoft.

* Tons of replacement parts
* Tons of upgrade parts
* People know how to work on them
* Cheap and reliable models
* High end models

It's really the easiest way to get into airsoft."

"It's more of the point that they demanded you pay to get access to the beta that's supposedly supposed to help them make their game better. So it's weird that they didn't just make it open considering how spread out and short the play sessions are. Also more players would mean a better test overall. That's not what happened though, they wanted to secure pre orders so they hyped up the beta with fancy cool marketing and hid the actual details about how infrequent the sessions would be because they knew way less people would pre order knowing they would never get a chance to play the beta, due to mostly work schedules or whatever else . It wasn't an illegal move but it sure was a dick head one."

"Exactly. 

Star Citizen is about so much more than buying ships or earning UEC. It should be fun for players who don't even own a ship and just crew or do ground missions.

That said, some people like to measure progress through accumulation. Star Citizen is meant to be a very long game with enough content for a significant investment over \*years.\* Folks who only want to sink in a couple hundred hours should \*not\* be able to do/experience/purchase everything there is to have. A solo player working alone \*should\* have little hope of owning and operating a capital imo.

And if Star Citizen proves comparable to Battlefront II in terms of re-playability, then the battle is already lost. Those man hours were ridiculous because it was a casual console game intended for a life-span of less than a year. Star Citizen should be a 10 year game - or more - and folks who play it that long should be able to have something to show for it."

"I gotcha. Here's what it said:

&gt; Every fan down in Smashville liked hype a lot…

&gt;But the Grinch, who lived somewhere in France, DID NOT!

&gt;The Grinch hated hype-ing! The whole pre-release season!

&gt;Now please don’t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.

​

&gt; It could be he was sick of all the fake leaks.

&gt;It could be, perhaps, he could not wait 6 weeks.

&gt;But I think that the most likely reason of all,

&gt;Was he knew Verg’s roster was two sizes too small.

​

&gt;Whatever the reason, the size or the wait,

&gt;He stood there on Wednesday, ready for hate.

&gt;Staring down at the banner with a sour, Grinchy frown,

&gt;At unreleased characters – shit’s about to go down.

​

&gt;For he knew every fan down in Smashville online,

&gt;Were caught in a drought, just passing the time.

&gt;“And they’re talking about Skull Kid!” He snarled with a sneer,

&gt;“Next month is Ultimate! It’s practically here!”

​

&gt;Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously humming,

&gt;“I must tell them somehow, they won’t see it coming!”

&gt;For each day he knew all the smash boys and smash girls,

&gt;Would cling to new leaks, it might make him hurl.

​

&gt;And then! Oh, the posts! Oh, the posts!

&gt;Posts! Posts! Posts!

&gt;That’s one thing he hated! The posts!

&gt;POSTS! POSTS! POSTS!

​

&gt;Then the fans young and old would talk and they’d guess.

&gt;And they’d guess! And they’d guess! And they’d GUESS!

&gt;GUESS! GUESS! GUESS!

​

&gt;They would guess there’d be Waddle Dee, and Minecraft’s own Steve.

&gt;Which was something the Grinch couldn’t stand to conceive.

&gt;And then they’d do something he liked least of all!

&gt;Every fan down in Smashville, the tall and the small,

​

&gt;Would all come together, like fish on a string.

&gt;Having taken the bait, oh to the threads they would cling!

&gt;His phone would ding! It would ding! It would Ding!

&gt;DING! DING! DING!

​

&gt;And the more the Grinch listened to his phone go ring ding,

&gt;The more the Grinch thought, “I must stop this whole thing!”

&gt;“Why, for 231 days I’ve put up with it now!”

&gt;“I must stop these fake leaks from coming! But how?”

​

&gt;Then he got an idea! An awful idea!

&gt;THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFULLY AWFUL IDEA!

&gt;“I know just what to do!” The Grinch laughed in his throat.

&gt;And he broke out his laptop and started to gloat.

​

&gt;And he chuckled, and clucked, “What a great Grinchy trick!”

&gt;“With this promo poster I have, they’ll know it’s legit!”

&gt;“All I need is a platform…” The grinch searched around.

&gt;But since the fanbase is large, no new ones were found.

​

&gt;Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply yelled,

&gt;“If they can post on 4 chan, I’ll make one myself!”

&gt;So he took out a pan and took up a pad,

&gt;He wrote, and he wrote, the fans won’t be had!

​

&gt;Then he added some cuses and some deconfirms too,

&gt;“There’s no new playable Pokemon, oh no, boo hoo.”

&gt;Then the Grinch yelled “It’s done!” and so he clicked,

&gt;It was posted online, but soon he was ticked.

​

&gt;The board remained dark. Quiet posts filled the air.

&gt;All the fans disregarded his post without care.

&gt;He read the replies, of which their were few,

&gt;“This leak is fake! This guy has no clue!”

​

&gt;He stared at the screen, clenching his fist.

&gt;Translating from French to English was hardly a synch.

&gt;He needed hard evidence, that much was clear.

&gt;But a photo? Too easily faked was his fear.

​

&gt;He thought and he thunk, about what he should do.

&gt;A video might cost him his job, that much was true.

&gt;“These characters,” he grinned, “the public must know!”

&gt;He knew it was time to put on a show.

​

&gt;He looked round the room, to make sure none could hear,

&gt;And he took out his phone, with much newfound cheer.

&gt;“And now!” grinned the Grinch “I’ll put them in a slum!”

&gt;He took out his phone, then took out his thumb.

​

&gt;He was swiping through apps, to decide what to use,

&gt;When he heard a loud sound, like the honk of a goose.

&gt;He turned around fast, and he saw the night-watchman,

&gt;It was Jack, oh how he hated this Scotsman.

​

&gt;The Grinch had been caught by this large man of honor,

&gt;Who’d seen the light left on, but the Grinch was no goner.

&gt;He started at the Grinch and barked, “Oh Eric, why,”

&gt;“Why are you taking pics of this banner? WHY?”

​

&gt;But you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,

&gt;He thought up a lie and he thought it up quick!

&gt;“Why my sweet old friend Jack,” the Grinchy Eric lied,

&gt;“There was a rip in this banner messing it up on one side!”

​

&gt;“So I was asked to stay late and fix it, my dear.”

&gt;“I’m texting the boss about the new one right here.”

&gt;And his fib fooled the watchman. Then the Grinch shook his head,

&gt;“You’re keeping me from my work,” he said.

​

&gt;And when Jack the Scotsman went away in a huff,

&gt;The Grinch took out his phone and loaded it up!

&gt;He lined up the evidence onto a desk,

&gt;Opened up snapchat, and thought of something grotesque.

​

&gt;He started recording the leak right there with his phone,

&gt;Writing “fuck you Nintendo lolllll” now all would be known!

&gt;He sent it along waiting for a response,

&gt;Someone screen-grabbed his snap with no nonchalance.

​

&gt;It was a quarter past midnight, some fans still in beds,

&gt;With dreams of Shantae and Elma in heads.

&gt;The Grinch he just sat, he sat, and waited.

&gt;Happy with the silence he had soon created.

​

&gt;Safe and anonymous, thanks to snapchat,

&gt;He’d surely put an end to speculation chitchat.

&gt;“PoohPooh to the fans!” he was Grinchishly humming.

&gt;“They’re finding out now no more surprises are coming!”

​

&gt;“They’re just waking up! I know what they’ll do!”

&gt;“Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,

&gt;Then the fans down in Smashville will all cry boohoo!”

&gt;“That’s a noise,” Grinned the Grinch, “That I simply MUST hear!”

&gt;So he paused. And the Grinch refreshed pages with cheer.

​

&gt;And he did read some words, flooding into the site.

&gt;It started out light, then his eyes widened in fright.

&gt;The words aren’t sad! Why, they sounded merry!

&gt;It couldn’t be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!

​

&gt;He stared down at Smashville and the Grinch popped his eyes!

&gt;To his core he shook, what he read was a shocking surprise!

&gt;Every fan down in Smashville, both casual and hardcore,

&gt;Were cheering and cheering! With no surprises in store!

​

&gt;He hadn’t stopped leaks from coming, they came!

&gt;What’s worse, he found out, they'd discovered his name!

&gt;And the Grinch, with his grinch-ears ringing with dinging,

&gt;Stood puzzling, and puzzling, “To what are they clinging?”

​

&gt;“It came without Directs! Without trailer posts!

&gt;It came without Sakurai, Reggi, or treehouse live hosts!”

&gt;And he puzzled and puzzled, till his puzzler was sore.

&gt;Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn’t before!

​

&gt;“Maybe hyping” he thought, “Doesn’t come from fake leaks.”

&gt;“Maybe hyping… perhaps… isn’t something so meek!”

&gt;And what happened then? Well in Smashville they say,

&gt;Smash Ultimate’s roster grew three sizes that day.

​

&gt;And the minute that Sakurai got word of the leak,

&gt;The cheers of his fans kept it from ruining his week.

&gt;The leaks they had come, but it hadn’t mattered.

&gt;The people were happy, and their hopes were untattered.

​

&gt;The trailers now could confirm restored hopes and new hype,

&gt;Hype that would keep ringing and dinging each night.﻿

By arguing against the linked source and it’s conclusions, you get to subtly *imply* that a majority of our homeless are from afar, without ever having to make the claim (or be “obligated” to back it up). 

It’s a convenient rhetorical position, if a somewhat lazy one. 

Personally I agree (assuming it’s your position) that a substantial chunk of our homeless population (and in particular of the the most disruptive element) are from afar. I agree it may well be a majority. I agree that the city needs to take a much firmer hand with this population, discourage migration to Seattle by the homeless, and encourage people to leave. Doesn’t change the fact that your rhetorical tactics are pretty shit. *And that I ain’t your google monkey.*"

"As a former evangelical, the whole “there are something’s we can’t understand” is a total cop out. 

A deity that is “perfect” as you think he is would make a completely logical and understandable world. Otherwise, he’s imperfect and that throws your whole faith thing out the window.

But here’s the thing, the universe is in fact quite understandable. Unfathomably complicated? Yes, but with every day we understand it more and more.

I’ve been where you are now. It’s difficult because you basically have to close your eyes and plug your ears and scream over the mountain of pure scientific evidence and just simple logic that utterly disputes there being a creator like the one you say there is. 

That’s why religious types go “well, there’s just somethings we can’t understand” because it’s exactly that, completely avoiding actually putting your beliefs to the test.

I think humans *tend* to care more for dogs than cows because it is in our nature to do so.  We selected traits in dogs and bred them specifically to be companions, and we selected traits in cows specifically to produce milk and meat."

"Read whatever. Each of Sanderson's works are largely self-contained as individual series, though there's plenty of cameos of his Cosmere if you're looking for them. Keep reading Cosmere if you're on a Sanderson kick.

Wheel of Time is a completely different style. Definitely grand scale like Sanderson's Stormlight Archive is, but WoT is by a different author for all but the last couple books and you can tell. Still some pretty good worldbuilding, massive books to chew through, and a good series in its own right; but the magic system is much looser, Jordan doesn't appear to be as organized in how he sets things up as Sanderson is, and there's a decently-sized rut in the middle-late part of the story as too many things are going on yet not enough happens in any of it per book.

I don't regret reading WoT at all, and will definitely give it a reread when I care enough to buy the books that I've lost since early high school, but my heart still lies with Sanderson."

I believe actors/actresses should be able to portray any role they can do so convincingly. If one were to use this same logic then it would be like saying a trans person should be limited only to roles that features a trans person. Given the fact that the limitations that have been placed on minority groups in Hollywood in the past are slowly being removed it would be a shame to take a step backwards and impose more restrictions on people in the industry.

"&gt;I'm getting the game for sure, but I think it's kinda fucked how Houser essentially bragged about overworking his employees just for us.

Based on what I've read about the Housers, It seems they themselves are okay with working themselves for 100 hour weeks and assumed that readers of the interview would see it as ""We have all these passionate employees dedicated to making this game"" instead of ""We've been massively overworking employees to get this game shipped on time""

I want to make it clear I think that having someone work a 100 hour week is insane incase it sounds like I'm defending their decisions above I was more trying to explain their point of view as to why they would brag about overworking employees."
"You can certainly classify that as trauma. Trauma works in strange ways; small things that seem insignificant can in fact cause a lot of damage. In my case, I once had a boyfriend who would grope and touch me in ways that I didn't like, even after I asked him to stop. This experience ultimately ended up being far more traumatic to me than a stranger rape I experienced several years before. The fact that I could easily get over the latter but not the former taught me important lessons on the nature of trauma, in particular that the *who* matters far more than the *what* or *how*.

I can relate though to problems of hypersexuality and sex repulsion. After a boyfriend violates your trust during sex it's hard to trust future partners, and intimacy requires that that trust exist. If there's no real intimacy, sex with a partner can get old and unfulfilling. It's no wonder that you wouldn't want it anymore.

My advice to you would be to seek out therapy and resolve the feelings you have that relate to that trauma. If you're not able to do therapy you might also consider talking over the incident with your ex-boyfriend and perhaps asking for an apology.

"Traditionally, tabloid refers to the format - literally the shape of the pages. In more modern usage, it refers to the newspapers that traditionally used that format (including the Daily Mail) after almost every broadsheet moved to a tabloid or tabloid-like format. It's basically just the Telegraph and the FT that are *actual* broadsheets, traditional broadsheets like the Times and Guardian moved to smaller formats.

But the Daily Mail is a tabloid whichever way you look at it. There's a bit of a distinction between the ""red tops"" - like the Sun, Mirror, Star etc and the mid-market tabloids like the Express and Mail."

"We don't have all of the answers in this regard, but we have a couple. God's decrees are oftentimes hidden from us and while we can glean answers here and there, God's decree is for him to know fully, not us.

The reasons I can think of given in Scripture are:

1. To demonstrate his wrath on evil and his power over it as well as the grace he has shown to those he has adopted [Romans 9:14-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+9%3A14-24&amp;version=ESV) (particularly v. 22)  

2. To bring about the decrees he has set in place so that all that God intends to pass comes to pass [Acts 4:26 / Genesis 50:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+18%3A23%2CEzekiel+33%3A11&amp;version=ESV) for example.

"This sounds great!  I do a few of these already, but my playthrough is sort of an ""immersion light"": 

**1) Only use upgrades for certain tasks.**  I am clearing out territory in phases.  My first phase is usually an ""all out assault"" period, where I arm myself to the teeth with armor and ammo, and deck my car out for full combat.  My rules for using the upgrades are similar to yours.  NO MODDING CAR EXCEPT IN A STRONGHOLD.  But for clothing, I RP that I carry my gear around in the car, but it's heavy so I only wear it if I know I'm going into a tough enemy base or something.  My second phase is more of a ""cleanup"" phase, where I take the Interceptor out with only Max's Jacket for my armor, and go scavenging similar to how you play, looking for ammo, water, etc.  I do love the idea of keeping perks low though, to make water and ammo searches more critical.

**2) Only use Magnum for trips where you *know* you're going to be in a lot of fights/need to take down towers and pull down doors.**  The Magnum is for rough combat.  The Interceptor is for scavenging.

**3) Nerf yourself.**  The biggest one here for immersion for me is making Chumbucket's repair skill *slower*.  I don't think he should be able to do major repairs in a couple of seconds.  I LOVE finishing a car battle, win or lose, then ducking off behind a boulder to wait while Chumbucket repairs the ride.  The other nerfs for me are to armor and ammo.  I'd never thought of ignoring Griffa and keeping fighting skills low.  I'll start doing this on my next run.

**4) No maps while driving, no balloons, and try not to use waypoints too much.**  This one is for immersion only, but I like to identify landmarks and make my way towards them.  Very similar to you, except I add the waypoints because I think Max usually only ventured as far as he could see, one site at a time.  He'd look at something worth exploring, go to it, and go from there.  Making waypoints all the way across the map, for me, breaks immersion some.

Most of those are variations of yours.  My primary difference is I allow myself to use car and armor upgrades, but only for certain tasks.  I like your style though.  This game has been one of the most immersive I've EVER played, and finding ways to enhance it even more is awesome.

"&gt;It’s like with Saudi Arabia — dismembering a single person gets us outraged, but the war in Yemen is too much to process, it’s just statistics.

They are two totally different things though. Incidental deaths of innocent people in a war is tragic, but it's distinguished by the presumed lack of intentionality. In the case of the children's bus that got bombed we don't know what happened or why precisely. The ambiguity there as to the level of intent, whether it was directed or not, and whether it was just a horrible accident make it hard to draw clear feelings about it other than that it is well and truly awful.

By contrast the murder of Kashoggi is pretty much unambiguous, shows clear intent, involved deliberate brutality, and involved the targeting of a civilian in a peacetime situation with the intention of silencing a critic of the powerful. There are many things that make it distinct and morally outrageous in a very different way. It isn't just because it's one guy instead of 20.  If 20 children get intentionally shot in the US people are rightly horrified, and it occupies the news for weeks. If those 20 children were shot on the orders of the president to send a political message to his enemies, you could be pretty damn certain people would be in a frenzy. Context matters here. "

"My son is 16 weeks, and seems to be now out of the 4mo sleep regression...which apparently came early.

We also nurse to sleep &amp; have since birth. My mama instincts always told me to nurse to sleep, and I honestly didn’t think it was so frowned upon until I was googling the 4-mo regression.

As I was reading sleeping advice, the general consensus was that it would create bad habits. I even started second guessing my choice, thinking that his sleep regression was exacerbated by his comfort nursing. 

For a few nights, I tried to nurse first, then wake him (if he fell asleep) &amp; place him in his crib. But it never worked: He wouldn’t fall asleep, he’d fuss, and it made our nighttime routine longer, harder &amp; unenjoyable. 

No thank you: I’ll choose the happy, easy path for us both, which happens to be nursing to sleep. And he’s back to sleeping a 5-7hr stretch, with some nights shorter, some longer.

Do what works for you &amp; your family—not what other “experts” say should work for you &amp; your family. I wish I just trusted my gut &amp; didn’t google...would have saved us both a few frustrating nights.

I also just want to Mom and not over analyze the shit out my baby’s sleeping and/or behavioral patterns. I also want my son to Baby &amp; not be judged for being, well, a baby. 

Like the term regression. Regression? He hasn’t been alive long enough to create a behavioral pattern to truly regress from. 

*This too shall pass* and *Go with the flow* are my new mantras for any developmental bumps in the growing-up road. The sleep regression doesn’t last forever. The fussiness doesn’t last forever. 

If nursing to sleep feels “right”—just do it. If it no longer feels “right,” then find an alternative sleeping cue.

Your baby is only young once, so choose the path that makes it the most enjoyable for you both—whatever that may be. 

EDIT: In the US, I really think we have highly unrealistic expectations for baby sleep. We’re also super focused on whether we have a “good” baby, who “sleeps through the night.” Such bs. Babies are not biologically built to sleep straight through the night. “Sleeping through the night” for a baby is a 4-7hr stretch. We live such a fast-pace lifestyle, no regards to family balance &amp; moms/dads barely getting any time off work, that our society pushes sleep training &amp; all these “experts.” It’s horrible.

Let baby be baby, I say!

First if you think this may be a mental health emergency call 911 or go to an ER.  Weirdos on the internet can't classify or diagnose any symptoms.   

The term NOS or ""not otherwise specified"" is used a lot in mental health when all the symptoms don't fit perfectly within the accepted range of what is the diagnostic criteria. 

Unspecified is often used when there just isn't enough information to make a diagnosis that fits perfectly in one of the other categories.  Providers might be leery to just throw any classification onto a patient, because it may effect care in the future; especially with younger patients.  So unspecified may be the first step to falling into one of the common subcategories or the diagnosis may remain unspecified for the duration of treatment.    Unspecified is frequently used when the symptoms have lasted to long to be called a brief psychotic episode. 

Categories and subcategories... I don't really have the degrees or experience necessary to pick out the finer points of the details.

"&gt; My aim was to do every single instance atleast once when levelling

This is one reason why I enjoy leveling Warriors so much - it's so damn simple to find groups to help gear yourself up. You can handcraft your group exactly how you want, inviting the precise comp that you desire - no more rolling against other melee dps or plate/mail users. Just message potential healers and once you find one you have most of the ""form a group"" part accomplished. Now just decide what sorts of buffs you and the healer want and start asking folks - they're bound to join if they have the time since you already have the tank/healer sorted.

"So you don't get R&amp;D as well as software costs are really high?Hardware is usually less than 30, even less than 20% of the cost of the total production of the product in tech area. And if we are talking about VR, I would bet - even less.

Basically, to give you an idea:You spend 10 millions USD at developing Oculus and the software for it. Then, you make the headset out of 100$ worth of parts. Congrats! You've just sold the 10 million dollar headset for 400 bucks!

Of course, once you start selling, the costs of development are starting to get covered by the fact that your product is selling - that is called ""break even"" in business world. That's when profits are equal the costs of developing and manufacturing the product. I.e. when you spent the money from day 0 of development and have got it all back.

I doubt Oculus made those millions back through Rift sales"

The standard io are just buffers that the kernel allocates so programs know where to look, in this way `/proc/bash_id/fd/0` is just a regular file more or less.

When piping to `/proc/bash_id/fd/0` your just forcing the string in to the kernel buffer,  which i guess means execve is never called as bash doesn't know theres a command to execute... I guess.

"Legs might reduce speed but they may also confer a resistance to mines or explosives, whereas large, bulky treads will catch the entire blast. A hovertank would have an air gap under it to dissipate explosions from mines etc, and might not set certain mines off at all.

A hovertank would have fewer moving parts, ergo require less maintenance.

-

Most cards start untapped. A lot of cards have an ability along the lines of ""Tap this card: do a thing"". Tapping is symbolized by turning the card 90 degrees to the right, sideways. You cannot tap a card if it is already tapped. At the start of your turn, your cards untap (unless something specifically prevents them from untapping). Overall this usually means that you can use these abilities once per turn.

"Ok. That just means you get creeped out by appearance compliments from all men, or you only perceive compliments in good light if they come from specific men (i.e.: you dad, your SO, the actual Chris Hemsworth?). If you don’t like men complimenting your appearance, that’s fine. However, just because you don’t like it doesn’t make it creepy. 

Example 1: (Catcalls) You’re looking *fine* today! = Creepy (unless coming from SO)

Example 2: Hey BelleoftheLibrary, I like the way your hair looks today. = Not creepy. Maybe unwarranted, but not creepy.

If you’re getting actual creepy compliments, I’m sorry, and you should report it to HR if possible.

But I do wonder. If someone who looked like the man of your dreams happened upon you, on the street or at a park or wherever, and started talking to you, you would find it creepy and ignore them? Or would you talk with them? And if they then proceeded to not say anything creepy but instead said some humorous and likeable things and decided to ask you out for a cup of coffee, you would turn this man down? Even if he seemed like the man of your dreams? If you did turn him down, why? Just curious."

I don’t disagree with your assessment of future technology completely though.

Then we’d be lucky to get in a situation similar to the matrix, just to stay in the picture. We are inventing our own obsolescence. The problem is bottlenecks in our i/o interface.

In that instance it'd be a lot better to make all four bisexual because at least there'd be a little more variety and a lot more variety for a female PC. I know Enhanced Edition added more romances I'm just talking about the original Baldur's Gate 2. Baldur's Gate also limited romances by race which, again, makes sense but not when there are so few candidates. I don't think dwarves had any partners."

"&gt;If you've supposed A is a knight, then you already know that this is the island of Maya, since the second statement is ""either or""

The second statement *is not* necessarily true, since it is stated by B, not A.  
However, I did make a mistake in my reasoning above, the system presented in the problem is *inconsistent*, that is in the last case we also get a contradiction.  

Let's go back step by step,  
and let K(x)=""x is a Knight"" (hence ~K(x)=""x is a Knave"")  
and let I = ""this is the island of Maya"".  
Note that K(x) implies that all statements stated by x are true, and ~K(x) implies that all statements stated by x are false.

Person A stated: (K(B) **xor** I)  
 it's negation is: ((K(B) **and** I) **or** (~K(B) **and** ~I))
Person B stated: (~K(A) **xor** I)  
 it's negation is: ((~K(A) **and** I) **or** (K(A) **and** ~I))

Up to this point I've only restated the problem symbolically (so it's easier to see if it diverges from the author's intent).  
at this point we *do not* know the truth value of those statements.  

Suppose K(A):  
This means the statement stated **by A** is true, that is: (K(B) **xor** I)    

Now there are two cases  

* K(B):  
in this case, since (K(B) **xor** I), and K(B), we know that (~I).  
However, since K(B), we know the statement stated **by B** is true, that is: (~K(A) **xor** I).  
Now since K(A) is true, and (~K(A) **xor** I) is true, we know that I is true.  
So we have shown that (~I **and** I), contradiction.  
* ~K(B):  
in this case, since (K(B) **xor** I). and (~K(B)), we know that (I).  
However, since (~K(B)), we know that the negation of the statement stated **by B** is true, that is we know  
((~K(A) **and** I) **or** (K(A) **and** ~I))  
Now since (I), we know that (K(A) **and** ~I) is false (since (~I) is false), hence (~K(A) **and** I) must be true, this implies (~K(A)).  
So we've show (K(A) **and** ~K(A)) (K(A) comes from the first assumption), contradiction.  

From the above, we can see that the assumption K(A) always results in a contradiction, therefore let's check the assumption (~K(A)).  

Suppose (~K(A)):  
This means that the negation of the statement stated **by A** is true, that is  
((K(B) **and** I) **or** (~K(B) **and** ~I))  
We have two cases again:  

* K(B):  
in this case, we know the statement stated **by B** is true, that is: (~K(A) **xor** I).  
since (~K(A)) is true, we know that (I) must be false, hence (~I).  
But from ((K(B) **and** I) **or** (~K(B) **and** ~I)) and K(B) we have that (~K(B) **and** ~I) is false, hence (K(B) **and** I), from that we know (I), that is we've shown (I **and** ~I), contradiction.  
* ~K(B):  
in this case, we know that the negation of the statement stated **by B** is true, that is we know  
((~K(A) **and** I) **or** (K(A) **and** ~I))  
Since (~K(A)), we know that (K(A) **and** ~I) is false, hence (~K(A) **and** I) is true, therefore (I) is true.  
however, from ((K(B) **and** I) **or** (~K(B) **and** ~I)) and (~K(B)) we know that (K(B) **and** I) is false, hence (~K(B) **and** ~I) is true, so (~I).  
But we've once against shown (I **and** (~I)), contradiction.  

We've covered all 4 options { (K(A), K(B)), (K(A), ~K(B)), (~K(A), K(B)), (~K(A), ~K(B)) }, and they all lead to a contradiction, hence the system presented in the problem is inconsistent.  "

"They probably also don't openly discuss it due to network regulations; I know Jim Bob was very vocal about what they practice during his campaign runs but TLC probably has something in their contract about not being overt so viewers don't complain. I honestly think more secular Christians are just fascinated by the train wreck, not convinced to join the cult. A lot of their fans seem to be Atheists or mainstream Christians for that reason. 

The programming begins from birth so it's not something that's particularly noticeable unless they were say, 10, and all of a sudden their parents began enforcing the religion on them. I would say that they seem pretty postmark for how the cult educates young children - quiet, meek, polite, kind of country, not particularly intelligent, easily influenced without much mind to challenge anything in their life. It seems to work for them and it's hard to say at this stage if any of them have rebellious thoughts brewing or if they're genuinely, cluelessly content. I think they understand that they make money and live the way they've always lived and that's all there is to it. It doesn't seem like they ponder their situation enough to recognize the signs of being programmed or inadvertently proselytizing to an audience. My thoughts."

"I think one thing that we’ve eatablished over the last few months before Mistcaller was printed, and we were experimenting with 0 CC lists, is that some # of 1 drop creatures are required just to speed up our board state.

Whether you play CC or Mistcaller is meta dependent at the moment, I currently think Mistcaller is the right choice because both are impactful about the same amount of the time, but Mistcaller can be a blowout, where CC never can (unless your opponent makes a huge mistake.)

As time goes on though, unless some fundamental change happens to modern, CC is only going to get worse because spells are getting cheaper and more efficient with every set that gets printed.

I think right now if you know your local meta is full of critical instants and sorceries that you need to race, you can make the case for CC and you’d probably be right. The likelihood of CC being content is going to get lower and lower as time goes on though.

"&gt; But the thing is, while Lojban *is* monoparsing, it's not meant to be grammatically simple. It needs and has a lot of grammar and grammatical rules necessary to be monoparsing, and more generally, to encode first-order predicate logic. This makes it easier for computers, but human beings don't need FOPL for unambiguous parsing. Lojban could be simpler if it abandoned these rules, but that's not the point of Lojban. You need to know those complicated rules to actually speak Lojban; basic grammar will only take you so far.

Same with any other language, really. Do you know the rule about adjective order in English? ""Quantity, Value/opinion, Size, Temperature, Age, Shape, Colour, Origin, Material""? It's an obscure rule most speakers are not aware of. But if you violate it, you are basically speaking broken English, even if a cooperative collocutor will typically still understand. And there's a buttload of hidden rules like that, governing our everyday communication, most of which goes completely unnoticed by conscious mind of an average speaker. With the entirety of lojban grammar, I still claim it is strictly simpler. You can speak broken lojban as well - computers might not understand, but people might.

&gt; Broadly, yes, I agree that Lojban attitudinals are pretty flexible and nice to use. What I contest is that they're ""spoken emotions"". What it really does is signal that ""I feel sad/happy/etc. about this."", which means that it really performs a speech act. It's more grammatically flexible than ""sadly"", for sure, and you can modify the emotion, but it performs the same function semantically. Calling it a ""spoken emotion"" feels like an excessively exaggerated way of putting it.

Again, you're missing the point. lojban grammar is not _describing_ attitudinals as spoken emotions. It is _defining_ attitudinals as spoken emotions. lojban is designed explicitly as a non-human language (in Chomskyan sense primarily, though the common-sense reading is not off either). It is meant to be usable by interlocutors that might lack the physiology to express, or understand, human emotions paralinguistically - like an heptapod alien, or less fictionally, an AI without a camera. To translate ""sadly"", one uses ""badri"". "".uinai"" is something else - which doesn't perform the same function semantically because it is explicitly defined not to. The only rationale that you insist that it does is analysing it descriptively as if it was just another natural human language. You criticise the small amounts of cultural bias that remain in lojban despite massive efforts to eliminate it wherever possible, yet you remain firmly biased to treat it as if it was English or Japanese, where ""spoken emotions"" are not a thing (so ""naturally"" they can't be in anything we call ""language"", because as we all know, all languages are basically Latin in disguise).

&gt; Haha, yeah, sorry, that was an asshole thing to say. Mea culpa.

Eh... One might try not to slip into ad hominem, but... happens. No worries. I guess I owe you an apology as well, I was rather sharp in my critique there.

&gt; (For example, there are a really huge number of tenses and aspects, but people generally fall back on basic European-influenced tenses and aspects to express themselves. Or how the default order is equivalent to subject-verb-object, which while not a strictly European trait, almost definitely came from there.)

I'll grant you the word order bit, though the only way not to have it would be to make argument particles (FA) obligatory. The fact that some tenses and aspects are used more than others is a reflection on speakers, again, not the language.

&gt; The issue is that while Lojban defines its words in terms of ideal forms, human beings *can't* use language that way.

So... when people communicate in lojban (which they most assuredly do), they are not human beings? Or are you claiming people who do communicate in lojban are just deluding themselves, and they're actually writing English but don't realise it?

&gt; When you say a word like *anger*, you're implicitly containing within it a number of unspoken assumptions and expressions about what that means. When is it acceptable to get angry? How can anger be expressed? These are all cultural expectations that require cultural knowledge.

And this cultural knowledge can also be presupposed by collocutors. This is basic pragmatics. If you assume your collocutor shares your cultural background, you can leave out the bits that you know to be shared. If you know they don't, you fill in the details. Remember how lojban can be super vague or super verbose, depending on what you want to express? The fact that lojban is designed to function as a non-human language doesn't cancel the fact that humans retain their full linguistic capability, including pragmatics, when they use it.

&gt; More subtly, consider the infamous example sentence, ""pretty little girls school"". In English, this acts as a sequence of semantic operations that builds on a number of cultural assumptions and ideas. Sure, it might not be syntactically unambiguous, but the end result is that you have a fairly definite mental image of what a ""pretty little girls school"" looks like

No, I don't - that's the point of the sentence. It might be a large building full of little girls, or a little building full of girls of unspecified size. It might be an ugly building full of pretty girls, or it might be a pretty building filled with girls of varying appearance. It can be a rather small, gender-segregated learning facility. I don't even know where ""big schools aren't pretty"" claim comes from. And given that a university [can contain schools](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/194294/can-i-use-the-word-school-when-referring-to-something-that-belongs-to-a-univer), you actually can't be sure even in English that we're not talking about a university - e.g. Ochanomizu University could be said to be a girls school.

&gt; The end result is something which cannot strictly be placed in the real world, it is fundamentally abstract. You can fall back on context and real world knowledge to place the sentence in reality, but what happens when people disagree?

Then they disagree. If you foresee that happening, you fill in more details. Happens in all languages. 

&gt; But the problem ultimately stems from the fact that Lojban has *no* default assumptions.

lojban doesn't. Its human speakers do.

&gt; and people don't realize what they are and aren't assuming.

This is the dangerous bit. But again, this is the failing of the speakers, not the language.

I have a big problem when people translate ""top of the class"" as ""klesi drudi"" or the standard example of non-insect ""social butterfly"" as ""jikca toldi"". But imagining a yelling person when you hear ""fengu"" is not against any rule - the worst that can happen is you might be mistaken (just like with ""angry"" if you don't know we're talking about a subordinate in a traditional Japanese office).

&gt; (The official grammar also confuses the matter by misanalyzing the English sentence; a modern linguistic analysis would interpret the English sentence as having only one parse, because phrases like ""little girl"" and ""little school"" and ""pretty little school"" and ""pretty little girl"" are in some way, semantically interrelated and not separate things.)

I have no idea where you're coming from with that. Of course there are different parses. While ""pretty"", ""little"", ""girls"" and ""school"" all contribute one meaning (actually two for ""pretty"" - as ""good-looking"" and ""rather""), the compositionality principle ensures the end meaning has something to do with all four - but the exact relationship between them depends on the parse. The parse being the which meanings are selected, and how the sentence delinearises into a syntax tree or dependency graph or whatever form your formalism of choice uses.

I don't readily have an example of parses for ""pretty little girls school"", so I'll give you a parallel example for [頭が赤い魚を食べた猫](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dk4irB0V4AELWqn.jpg), which depending on which of the five parses you look at, means ""the red-headed cat that ate a fish"", ""the cat that ate a red-headed fish"", ""the cat whose head ate a red fish"", ""the head is a cat that ate a red fish"" or ""the head is a red cat that ate a fish"".

&gt; I guess ultimately, my problem with the website is that... it tries to sell Lojban as some random 'perfect' language.

Nowhere does the page claim lojban is perfect. It's all in your head.

&gt; Lojban isn't a natural language, and cannot be changed to be like a natural language

Fully agreed, despite you insisting to argue some of your points as if it was. And yet, nowhere does the website claim it is a natural language.

&gt; papering over what it actually is with a number of selling points isn't the right way to go at it. 

The ""selling points"", as I argue, are all true; while you can misrepresent the truth by omission, I see nothing wrong with the claims as made on the website. But even if you disagree and the page is pure marketing bullshit, it seems silly to me to lose interest in the language just because someone made a website you don't agree with.

&gt; People need to know what they're getting into.

Sure. Can you explain lojban better in one screen?

Your ""getting into"" sounds like once someone gets hooked by the ""selling points"", they will be held at gunpoint till they finish reading CLL. If at any point you lose interest in what you're learning, you can stop, no further consequences; but you can't know whether you'll find it interesting or not without learning a bit more than ""selling points"". 

And even then, the process is typically layered: The first page serves to interest people, nudge them to read more. If you like that, there is a page to read more, with a bit more detail. If you still like it, there's a bunch of other introductory material one can go through if not yet ready to tackle CLL."

"With flowers?? To be bluntly honest, that is a terrible idea. If she is making jokes like that, and taking it super hard that he doesn't find her attractive, then she sees him in a way he doesn't see her. Giving her flowers risks giving the wrong impression, making things worse, and also implies that his comment is a much bigger deal than it actually was."

"Very true, but Ubisoft saw how T2L went down. Lightseekers was late to the party (and didn't look very impressive, IMO) so I'm not sure they're a great comparison, but still a viable point to the argument.

Frankly? I'd wager the fact that a digital-only option exists is likely the only reason we've toys at all. Given how much T2L tanked once they market got absolutely flooded, no one would touch it. Nintendo is hardly even T2L (but doing it correctly, IMO, making it a toy/collectable that happens to work in games, not a toy for *a* game that can double as a display) so the fact that anyone else is even *trying* T2L again is likely only because someone made the argument they could do both. The toys generate the hype and conversation, the digital-only option appeals to people who heard about the toys, but don't want them."

Personally just on experience, I would have fathered a larger age gap for social reasons. Because my brother and I are so close, we are rivals at most things and have a hard time agreeing. I think we instinctively tried to carve out our own niches because competing was virtually impossible. Now that we are adults i still have a really strained relationship with him, compared to my peers who have a bigger age gap with their siblings. "

The HITs may expect workers to do something that some people are comfortable with while others aren't, for ex. computer cam usage.  My computer has good memory space (500 gigs) but the processor is a cheap/basic one which could have made these jobs unrealistic for me when considering things in terms of pay per hour.

Oh, for heaven's sake.  It's common, as a matter of English style (and by ""style"" I mean ""conventions of style"" as opposed to ""rules of grammar,"" not whether something is stylish or not), to use ""God"" to refer to the monotheistic Judeo/Christian god and lowercase ""god"" for one of the polytheistic pantheons.

It doesn't denote a ""belief,"" it denotes following common English usage.  Faust is about the Judeo/Christian ""God"" and therefore the capitalization is correct.

It was ok when they “said” in D1 eververse was to help for live events, which usually went on to be lackluster, but D2 is a full priced game, they just recently allowed ppl to get D2 without getting the other worser expansions and after all that you don’t even unlock everything in the game. Despicable. I still love Bungie, like Blizzard, they make fantastic games but I hate that they chose to work with Activision, IMO, a trillion times worse than EA.

P.S. I think I spent over 100 EV in D1. Only regret half. I think can put up with it if they make game that’s actually different."

"Better insurance fraud idea. Find a house that needs substantial renovations or maybe even a tear down in an active real estate market. Essentially, the value is the property, and the house is a negative since it will cost money to either gut and then renovate or demolish. It might be an expensive part too, especially if its an older house riddled with asbestos and lead paint. Get house insurance on the property but obviously let the insurance know you intend to renovate/demolish it. Then stage a high school party in the place, and start a fire, make it look like a bunch of drunk kids were trying to cook something over an indoor camp fire in a pot or something. The house will burn down, or will be substantially damaged so that the insurance will foot the bill for either the gutting of the place, or the demolition. This might also entail complete asbestos abatement of the property, which can cost a shit load. Then you can just flip the property to a real renovation guy for 50-100K more then you paid for it, since that's more than the amount the gutting or demolition would have cost anyways. That's it, a little bit of paper work, bada boom, bada bing, you just made a nice chunk of change. 

Obviously this isn't likely worth the trouble in rural Alabama, but it would be in an expensive city. Also a crucial part of the plan is the real estate market being hot so you can actually flip the property. Where I am shit sells before its even listed so it wouldn't be hard. You certainly don't want to end up owning a property lot that no one will buy and you don't know how to build on though, so this will only work in certain areas. Unless you know how to renovate/build a house, in which case, just do all this and then don't flip it, renovate it/build it and sell it, but you conned the insurance into paying for the gutting/demo/asbestos abatement.

At every appointment I’ve ever been to, doctors have really appreciated that I compiled the medical records myself so it’s handy and easy for them to access all at once. In fact, I only started doing this because I’ve had doctors, busy specialists especially, get very catty with me about giving them my other doctors’ contact information and asking them to get the records themselves, and I’ve actually waited months to get appointments that then turned out to be a total waste of time because I didn’t compile and bring records with me for them to look at, and they basically told me to compile them then come back in their next open spot...months later. I can’t guess at Aubrey’s motivation for doing this, but from my experience, it’s the doctors themselves that prefer hard copies, unless they’re all in the same hospital system. "

"That's a fair point, but i dont think everyone below is going to ever get to the top 2% or 1%. So basically, theyre catering to the needs of less than 9% of the player base, its a reason why so many people leave the game. Now im not saying i would ever leave, but when you ONLY balance around the highest players, you lose any hope of keeping casuals, bad players and new players playing the game. I mean, youre wrong about ubisoft balancing solely around the top tier players anyway, i think what they did eoth aramusha will prove that point. But i mean, at the end of the day, this game isnt balanced around the top 1% or even the top 20% its just not balanced in general. They 400ms delayed lights because git gud. But then they have characters like lawbringer or cent who they say are in a fine place. Idk, it's all very mixed feelings. If they would pick 1v1 or 4v4 to balance around and casual or high level to valance around then maybe we could have some consistency. The way the game is right now though, is very bad for both the 95% and the top 5%. Doesnt really matter which category we fall into. And thats not to mention the differences between console and pc, and the fact that they combine their data from all platforms"

"When I confronted I told my wife she should go to other man and I started packing her bags, she started hysterically crying, sobbing, snot-blowing coming out of her nose and mouth. I am not the type who crying and begging usually work, and I didn't show it to her at the moment, but I do have to say that it made quite an impact to me. I had never seen her like that before.

I know that's not exactly the same thing as ""begging,"" but I think it's in the same family.

Obviously it was a genuine reaction when I told her I had caught her. She didn't have time to think of what to say, how to act. If I had thought she had planned it, it would not have had the same effect.

I think begging is an extension of what I refer to as ""humbling"" yourself, which I think is needed to reconcile. With any wrongdoing, to reconcile afterward, basically you have to apologize and, depending on the seriousness of the offense, be a little deferential for a time.

As far as communication, words are one thing, body language is another, actions are a third, and omissions are a fourth. To reconcile, all four have to be in agreement. I guess begging would hit the first two things. They are important, but I would think the last two things are more important."

Because without it no Golden Freeza, and much much more importantly no Freeza in the ToP. And I loved Freeza’s presence and return there. 

It gave me more of his and Goku’s awesome interactions, developed his character so that he can be a even more dangerous villain and has great moments like his and Goku’s conversation in Hell, his working with Gohan against Frost and most importantly the utterly amazing teamwork he displayed with Goku in 131."

"First time posting on this Reddit. This episode was awesome,  better than last week's in my opinion. But there were definitely some issues that I noticed (or at least details that I missed, please enlighten me if possible!) 

-The new Voodoo Queen tells Cordelia that Papa Legba will only make someone an offer once,  and that Cordelia wasted it.  But the first thing Papa asked Dinah was if she had summoned him to reconsider his offer of immortality,  so apparently he IS willing to resume negotiations. 

-The scene with Queenie,  Zoe,  Mallory,  and Coco was cute and fun,  but the part where Coco died was cringy. They didn't try to help her at all,  they just stood and watched. ""Don't you know a spell??"" Jesus H Crist just do the Heimlich maneuver :/ and she died in like 5 seconds. 

-How did Cordelia's hand heal after that spell to ressurect Myrtle? Her skin was melting off.  Sure it could be argued that they have witchcraft at their disposal but if they had such strong healing magic to complety nullify third-degree burns then surely they could've used that on Cordelia in Coven after she was blinded with acid? 

-What was going on with John Henry's resurrection? They presented it like one of the Seven Wonders but I don't remember recreating life from a pile of ash as any of the wonders.  It certainly wasn't Vitalum Vitalus or however it was called... you can't balance the life forces between the ashes of someone dead for weeks and a living person. And if VV was capable of that then surely they would have tried that with Misty after she crumbled in the Coven finale. 

-I don't really understand anything that happened with Mead. So she was a part of the Coven? How was she connected? And if the witches had a time-honored agreement to never burn a warlock, why did they let John Henry burn Mead (presuming she was a Salem descendant)? There must have been a reciprocal agreement as well in which warlocks wouldn't burn witches. 

-Cordelia burning the super poison stuff was really dumb. If it was combustible then it could have exploded,  releasing the chemicals in the air and killing all the witches present. Plus the warlocks were already caught red-handed,  they might as well have tried to throw the poison or something. They gave up pretty easily. 

-What happened to all of the new witches at the Salem academy? We've only seen like 4 of them once.  I understand that the season doesn't have time to focus on a bunch of new characters because it's only 10 episodes but it suddenly seems like nobody else is in the entire school. 

-On the topic of students,  where are all of the young warlocks? What is going to happen to them?  It seems that Behold is chilling with the Coven for now,  and I presume John Henry might do the same. But then who is running the warlock academy? The Grand Chancellor is dead and it doesn't seem that they have any teachers left. 

There were a couple of other things that caught my eye but I don't remember them all.  I'm honestly not trying to be picky but,  as much as I'm loving the fan service and allusions,  this season seems much less put together than Coven. Which would be fine if it wasn't so heavily based on Coven... but it just seems worlds apart,  definitely not a spiritual successor. Still happy to get any resolution at all though!

"Thats true that he stayed strong mentally and did his best with his deficit.

But the point is it wasnt about him this game. He put his team in a huge disadvantage. It was on the team to compensate so he could even get a chance to do stuff, later when he became relevant again.

Thats why pro players play safe in lane normally. You just cost your hole team the game in 90% of the cases. So what you describe is analysis in hindsight. Normally he wont be relevant that game because the game doesnt goes that far vs a better team. And normally he just lost his team that game with that."

But your death will only bring a serious bout of confusion, terror, anger, and hatred from your son if you leave. I know it isn’t fair that you’ve been treated this way. Nobody deserves to not see their son. You seem like such a kind and loving man who misses his son very much. There is so much for you to live for, and you have the capacity to win this. I believe in that. I don’t want you to commit suicide. To be honest, it would break my soul to know that we or somebody couldn’t help you in your time of need. I know there are others in your life it would hurt so badly if you left. you can build new relationships, you can find new love. All with your son in your life, too.

"&gt; That's beyond the original proposition, that the Russians lost a lot by not having capitalism.

Because now we are using a very bastardized definition of capitalism just as the Chinese use a very bastardized definition of socialism. Is capitalism now any kind of mixed economy and only pure socialism is socialism? That doesn’t make sense. 

&gt; What? The south? I don't know, why does it matter?

Because I would say the adopted capitalism before the Korean War and didn’t have a very good economy to show for it. I’d argue they were capitalist when they were under Japanese occupation. 

&gt; Russia was very powerful before, all it needs was a systemic renovation. And the point was communism was a bad choice because it cost the Russian people the benefits capitalism would provide.

No not really powerful. Bordering really powerful nations. Huge land, rich in resources, but totally undeveloped in terms of industrial capacity. You could just as easily argue a more politically pluralistic, democratic socialist economy would have been even more successful.

It's absolutely beautiful, and I was very frustrated I couldn't find the reason why they were all blue. I finally found it mentioned in an old book. I was a little disappointed, but the journey to figure them out was fun.

"“Officer CUP1D...OFFICER CUP1D!” 

“Yeah, yeah, I know.”

I walk out the door with a pink gun and heart shaped bullets. “God, I look lame...” I muttered, but I think it’s gonna grow on me. This is my first crowd control mission. A terrorist from a rival faction, H4D3S, is about to attack an airplane station. And I’m there to...calm down the citizens.

Most of the time, I help my faction calm situations ranging from quarreling couples to domestic abuse. But in my spare time, I play matchmaker. I’ve been nicknamed Cupid for that. And my serial number.

I board my white helicopter called the “Angel’s Wings” and start flying towards Greece. I land just in time, because H4D3S had just shown up. “Huh, Hades.” I said in a half-amused voice. I keep the helicopter steady using autopilot, but I aim my sniper at the panicking people. I shoot faster than I consciously assess the area. This is nothing like matchmaking! I have no idea who goes with who! Ah well, the gun’s effect only lasts for a few hours if the two didn’t already have any attraction to each other.

Hades keeps threatening the station with the ticking timebomb so my fellow teammates Z3US and H3R4 team up to disable the bomb, but if that doesn’t work...it will. 

Zeus (wow, these names are coming to me fast) starts throwing “Lightning”, a digital virus that flies through the air and disabled technology, while Hera (were these intentional?) starts organizing the now lovestruck citizens. Lightning isn’t working, I think he knew this would happen! This is hopeless! 

I sit back in the helicopter and sigh. I suddenly get a call from my commander. I picked up the phone dejectedly. “Officer Cupid! I saw you give up! You can’t! We need every man we can out here!” I look back outside the helicopter and see several groups of people jumping out of planes, helicopters and everything in between! All from our faction! But on the opposite side, Hades brought some reinforcements of his own. “-ARE YOU LISTENING? GET OUT THERE, OFFICER, OR I’LL GET THERE AND SHOOT YOUR GUN FOR YOU!” I grab my gun and keep shooting, but panicked citizens are hard for Hera to organize.

Now there are tons of people here, and I have to be careful not to hit my own men. A few minutes later, the bomb is defused! I let out a relieved sigh. I hear cheering from my teammates, and I feel really accomplished. 

Weeks later, the Battle of Athens became a famous event, and with most of the opposing faction are dead or seriously injured, my faction (which I forgot to tell you, is named Olympus, so it was intentional!) has been disbanded. I now work as a lone matchmaker, encouraging shy people to speak their mind and stopping abusive relationships. Weird how hobbies become jobs.

It is no longer necessary to start the accompanying quest of Samopesh blacksmith. The second and any other Tournament now always periodically occurs every 7 days even when the player is close by. It is now possible to wait right next to the Herald. Guards will no longer attempt to frisk you during an active tournament, which caused the Tournament to fail. Tournament will no longer delete some items of players who have huge amounts of items in their inventory. Possible infinite fader during later Tournament stages fixed.  – Other Fixes– It is now possible to start Miracles While You Wait even if you refuse Charlatan multiple times. It is now much easier to hit the topping out during Miracles While You Wait quest. Fixed bug in Miracles While You Wait that sometimes broke the ending if the player completed the whole quest without saving or loading. Rare crash during escape from Skalitz fixed. Absurdly bright screen caused by persisting effect of Nighthawk potion during daylight has been fixed. Any remaining issues can be solved by drinking another Nighthawk potion and waiting for a few hours.

First 4 picks where dimir, i ended with a RBUG draft. Why not pick al the good cards if you got the mana base already. The planewalkers where first and second pick 3d booster. Without them i would have been screwed if this was a paper draft.

"&gt; If you want to control someone, you don't order them, you don't subjugate them, you just give them the physical things they want. From that understanding, it's straightforward that the people who have access to all of the physical things are 100% controlled.

I don't follow this part.  Even given the dubious claim that subjugation doesn't work for control (contra: literal slaves) and giving people things they want is, the ""giving"" part seems to be doing a lot of work that you throw away in the very next line.  The giver's control over the recipient comes from withholding the things they want: I get that the ultrarich aren't all-powerful, but when it comes to buying things on the open market, there's no ""giver"" to control them.

I also get that you're saying that the imperative of having money itself is the ""giver"" and thus what controls them, but this relies on people having incredibly high consumption rates, something which isn't close to true for the ~3%ers that I know and would be even less so for %1ers.  IMO the core thing you're missing is that humans already start out in debt from the perspective of doing what they want.  Someone with no resources is already a slave to the imperatives of gaining access to subsistence resources like food, shelter, and maybe sex; obviously a middle-class Westerner defines this minimum up substantially, but the discretionary gap between your level of wealth and your required consumption floor is positively correlated with level of wealth. This gap is precisely freedom.

I guess my main disagreement with your claim is that it pre-supposes not only that the ultrarich are chained to increasing their wealth beyond what a (relatively) passive return would give them, but that this constraint operates on them to a greater degree than it does to the other 99% of people."

"This makes sense from a business perspective at least. Superheroes are hot, MHA is a hot superhero property, and theoretically you could even build your own cinematic universe off of MHA (core story, Vigilantes, All Might solo, etc.).

Of course, we all know the track record of anime adaptations, so excitement may not entirely be warranted at the moment. Furthermore, video games and anime are notorious for having film projects ""in the works"" for years without any real progress, so the odds of this even happening may be lower than the odds of it actually being good.

On the other hand, I actually think the series could adapt to film fairly well. Nobody really has a quirk that would be out of place in any other modern effects-driven superhero movie, and basically the first season of the show (so beginning to USJ) could feasibly be condensed into a 2-hour movie.

Frankly, I do think that the day where we get a solid to good adaptation of a major manga/anime property is coming sooner than we might think, the question is whether this will be the movie to do it, if it ever comes out. Color me interested."

"Claro. Egresado UANL hace 3 años, viviendo en MTY, promedio 86, el mercado laboral está muy competido, y poco pagado, si entras a cualquier grupo de ""bolsa de trabajo para médicos"" se encuentran empleos de entre 1000-5000 pesos (este último si te acomodas bien). Varios de nosotros hemos tenido 2 trabajos de turno completo para poder darnos a vivir.


Además que se ocupa una paciencia increíble para poder lidiar con 20-50 pacientes diarios, muchos de ellos medio amargados y latosos y otros tantos que no siguen indicaciones y no respetan. Además si algo pasa aún si el paciente le valió madre lo que le dijiste de tratamiento, te echarán la culpa. 

La mayor (más no única forma de superación) es pasar el examen nacional para aspirantes a residencias médicas. El cual pasan solo el 7% de los aspirantes. Me tomo 3 intentos acreditarlo y aún me faltan las horas de esclavitud en la especialidad de días de 36 horas llenas de trabajo naturalmente, colegas y maestros muy jerarquícos y a veces sádicos con los de ""grado menor"". Además de pagar cuota universitaria, exponer clases y casos de pacientes, hacer trabajos de investigación.

Y la formación de pregrado incluye múltiples horas de estudio para frecuentemente no salir tan bien en un examen como se quisiera, la mala actitud que también se ve durante las clases y prácticas.  Perderse de eventos familiares, no poder disfrutar fines de semana tan bien como otras carreras.

"It depends.  Doughty getting his slapshot blocked from the point more often than not is a running criticism for Kings fans.  Not usually a wrist shot guy.  Tries to force that slapshot, but don't know if he's told to do that, or if it's a choice.  He is Drew Doughty, so I imagine he has at least some freedom out there, but maybe conservative coaches tell him to keep things as simple as possible.

You can look up Cup highlights and find a great goal against the Devils, and another one against the Rangers, and that's the Doughty that should be out there more.  What keeps him from that, who knows."

"&gt;$200k house

Where got such a cheap flat?

Actually, I acknowledge that this is possible, for the lucky people who were at the right stage of life at the right time. A 3-room HDB flat could be bought for less than $200k in 2007 or earlier. So if you are in your early 40s now, and you got married in your early 20s and bought such a flat, you would be in good shape and could possibly retire. Might require not having kids though.

Timing is a huge deal. The main reason why I'm doing well now is because I bought my first home in 2006, at the bottom of the market. It's not because of my salary or being frugal. It's pure luck and people who are 5-10 years younger than me are in much worse shape financially despite having similar career paths."

"Yea definitely.  Anybody with a background in alien art history would be valuable, you learn a lot about history by studying a culture’s art. On a ship like the Enterprise, particularly the 1701 or the D, there definitely would be a historian that focused on alien art.  

There probably wouldn’t be one on a Miranda or Excelsior on a particular mission, but you could make it be somebody with an art history degree who’s doing another job.  A human art historian would definitely still have work on earth.  I don’t know if a human art historian would be working in their field on a ship like Enterprise, they could be Starfleet but researching on earth or teaching, either at Starfleet Academy or a civilian art school. You could also have a human art historian serving on the Enterprise in another capacity, like how Picard was an anthropologist but serving in a command role.  You could have say a shuttle pilot who majored in art history. 

I think the most interesting way would be to have a Klingon or Vorta or Alien of the Week Art Historian tho."
"Right.  From the article;

&gt;“With the labor market tightening, stronger wage pressures should continue to feed through into higher inflation over the rest of this year,” Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.

 From 2013-2016, inflation never rose above 2%.  We have had 2% twice since (2018 estimated).

We haven't even finished year 1 of the tax cuts being implemented (this was Q2 2018).  [Walgreens specifically cited tax cuts as the reason they are going to increase wages](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/walgreens-to-spend-150-million-to-boost-wages-thanks-to-tax-cut-benefits-14743360).

The fact we have seen so much growth in such a short period of time is absolutely amazing.  God bless our President."

Meaningless neologisms aside, I agree. This is why I observed that transgender athletes are a (minuscule) category unto themselves and that no fair or meaningful comparison can be made (between women and trans-women).

There have definitely been a few times when expressing my true feelings has not gone as well as I hoped.

If you want to make 125-150K, and work at some of the top tech, consulting, banking, F500 companies in mid-management roles where some GM paths lead very strongly to Director/VP level, go get an MBA from a T10 or T15 school.

"Here is my analysis of the clip frame by frame. Technically, Nova Warp didn't kill you. But it did hit you really hard.

&amp;#x200B;

0:02 - you shoot your tether

0:03 you see the 2 point hit register, indicating the tether has connected

0:04 you can see the warlock's charged Nova being released, and you do NOT take any damage from it at that point

0:05 you are approaching the warlock with your shotgun. You take a huge damage hit from something, possibly the outer edges of the Nova Warp AoE as it fades off. You do not take lethal damage and are still alive. A few frames later, there seems to be a second damage hit, but that could still just be the same damage from a few frames ago.

0:06 you get off one badly placed shotgun blast, that only does 2 pellets of damage ( 24+24=48) and start to follow up with a melee

0:07 you get your 100 pt melee off, bringing the 'lock to a tiny sliver of overshield. The warlock also me lees you, causing the final explosion on screen and getting the melee kill.

&amp;#x200B;

The real issue here is that you approached a Nova Warp warlock who was coming out of their super, and did not know that it would burst because that is how the Nova Warp works when it ends for any reason. It was your own mistake, due to a lack of knowledge about how this super works. Next time, wait for the explosion first before going in for the shotgun hug. Or just stop being yet another shotgun-meta plebe. There is nothing broken here but your skill.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:  You died to a tethered Nova Warp because your shotgun aim is shit. Both your shotgun blast and your melee hit first. You would have won, had you got more than 2 pellets to hit."

Title: **Retail Legal Advice**

Original Post: 

&gt; Hey all, so I purchased two items; one large ticket item and one smaller one, from a very large online retailer back on September 14th 2018. September 21st 2018 the retailer refunded the full amount to my account, right after they charged me for the smaller item but not the large item. I called them multiple times explaining to them that I have the items but haven't payed for the majority of the item.  The associate told me he didn't want to keep me on hold for too long so he said he'd call me back. I have not had any contact with the company since October 1st. i am just unaware of what to do so I came here for advice. Anything helps!

I don't think tricking her to doing more exercising to go on walks together is not going to work too, you can always eat back everything way faster then you can exercise it off.

"Naw fam, there's nothing wrong with fursuiting

...at a con or in private. It's when interactions with children get involved that it gets weird and creepy, which is why fursuiting in public is not always something i'd encourage.

They're the parts that get most attention, yes. Because they're the easiest to point at and laugh or cringe at. Even we can do that. 

How else do we promote it if not online? Websites like e621.net aren't bothering anyone, and when shit like this gets posted, it usually goes unnoticed. Also, those small parts could just be *the same group*, since an individual could belong to multiple of them at once. Kero wasn't *just* a zoophile, he was also a pedo and a necrophile.

You *would* never know i'm a furry if i met you IRL. But me online is different from reality. But then, i do none of those things. (Well, i am somewhat interested in owning a fursuit for the memes but i'll never have the income for one so who cares.)"

Title: **Car repossession for deceased parent**

Original Post: 

&gt; Hello all. Looking for advice on what to expect. I'm the executor of my moms estate and working with a probate attorney on her estate. She had a car that is half paid off, and basically Kelly blue books at the value remaining on the loan. 
&gt; 
&gt; The loan officers are calling me now (since I notified them of her death and gave her a D.C.). Yes they already tried to get me to pay a balance due which I flatly denied. 
&gt; 
&gt; They said since I do not plan on keeping or using the car that they can arrange a repossession. I was wondering, what can I expect during this time? What can I do to protect the estate as much as possible for agreeing to do anything and what should I request. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help!

"Because the dependencies would be damned near impossible to maintain.

Think about it.  A security fix is just a modification to one method, but between version 1 of a class and version 10 of a class when the security fix is done, there have been 3 significant re-architectures that touch hundreds of classes.  Part of those re-architectures have dramatically changed how that method works so now the security fix won't just work on the version you phones old OS has.  What do you do?  you can't just apply the fix to the original method because it doesn't make sense in that context.  If you try to apply it to the new method then you need to figure out what happened in version 2-9 and include all of those objects, the objects they're dependent on, and any other fixes that touch those dependent objects.  Quickly it turns out you just need to include everything.

Do you really expect them to fix the same issue 10 times simply because some people don't want to upgrade their OS?  If they were to do that your device or your upgrades would cost a whole hell of a lot more, but I doubt it's even possible.

it's hard enough as it is figuring out which fixes are interdependent and need to be bundled, and keeping those bundles from turning massive.

Edit: also, you know what would happen if they did this?  People would just start complaining about why they can't pick which of the new features they want without upgrading.

TBF, people want what they want and will demand it regardless of how reasonable or unreasonable it is.  If they get what they want and it costs a lot then they'll just bitch about that.  At some point as a company you just need to accept that no matter what people will be unhappy so you strike the best balance you can.

Edit 2: Even if you want to take windows as an example - you can download individual fixes but at some point those all get rolled into cumulative updates.  You can't take a hotfix from windows 10 and expect to apply it to windows 98 can you?"

"What is it about these skater turds that makes them so callous to these types of injuries. I ALWAYS see skater kids just standing around staring after a horrific injury. You'd figure in a sport like that, they would have the knowledge and preparation for dealing with this kinda stuff. I'm sure all these dudes have taken bumps before so you'd figure they would build a little empathy. How is your initial reaction not to rush over and give some/any kind of assistance? Even if it's to simply see what kind of injury it is, so you can  relay that information to the emergency operator. Only a few things grind my gears, but this is definitely one of them."

"There are some people tied to the conceptual engineering literature that have asked these very questions.

On truth, in *Replacing Truth*, Kevin Scharp argues that our concept of truth leads to paradoxes like the liar. We need to either revise or replace our inconsistent concept of truth to avoid these paradoxes. But doesn’t that require some use of a truth-concept to evaluate whether the replacement concept and its related theory is true? Scharp agrees that it does, but, following Hasok Chang’s iterative coherentism in *Inventing Temperature*, argues that we can use our initial concept to see that the concept itself is defective and then replace it with a better one that avoids those defects but retains the positive aspects of the original one. (Sort of like throwing the ladder away after climbing up it.)

Chang (and Scharp after him) uses the story of someone using scratched/broken glasses to look in the mirror to see that the glasses are scratched. This allows the person to see that her situation isn’t perfect, but also lets her see what needs to be improved. Hadn’t she had the scratched glasses (inconsistent/imperfect concept) in the first place, she wouldn’t be able to improve her epistemic situation (revise or replace the old concept with new and better ones). Is this circular? Maybe, but it doesn’t seem that bad, and might not even be avoidable in practice. (Chang also makes the point that we’ve got not choice than doing this sort of circular justification in the case of establishing measurement of temperature.)

With normative concepts like ‘ought’, Matti Eklund has recently published *Choosing Normative Concepts*. I’ve heard it addresses the question you asked about normative concepts, but I haven’t read it so I can’t give you a rundown of Eklund’s views. I’ve heard it’s good though. "
"My name is Deku Washington McCracker, and I will become the number one hero."
"Aside from the unnecessary snark of a LMGTFY link, I fail to see any proof that this would somehow be widespread and inevitable. (FWIW, you can view many videos after searching ""exploding iPhone."") 

How about the millions of third party batteries that are in use in Android phones that **don't** explode? The reality is that Apple has a history of making their products intentionally and unnecessarily difficult to repair in order to drive business to their retail outlets with the intention of encouraging upgrading over repairing, and attempting to monopolize the repair market. And just because there are some sketchy batteries on the market, it doesn't mean that we would somehow see a multitude of exploding batteries, because most people generally do research and choose reputable manufacturers. Besides, being an OEM battery isn't some guarantee that a battery *won't* explode, considering that the most prevalent battery referenced on this topic is an OEM Samsung battery (Note 7). You aren't magically protected from battery malfunctions or engineering mistakes simply by buying an Apple product; this is the company that made a phone with poor cell reception due to an engineering mistake, and then blamed the users because they were ""holding them wrong.""

It is my *opinion* that, at least in the era before waterproof/water resistant phones, Apple simply made the battery non-removable in order to maximize profits and to cultivate brand loyalty by forcing users to go to the official stores in order to replace the batteries. 

Just my two cents. "

"The Avvar really supports what Merrill and Solas says about spirits: that they appear as benevolent or demons depending on how you choose to view them. However, there may be a problem into accepting this truth especially when you reestablish the Circle and Templar orders. An important tenet of Andrastian belief is that ""Magic must serve man and never rule over them"" and accepting that spirits can be benevolent will run against that belief. This truth will give more importance to mages since it would mean people would go to them  for help so the mages would have more leverage to campaign for their rights; which would mean a diminishing of Chantry and Templar power. Remember that the Chantry and the Templar needs mages to be subservient and need to believe they are more destructive than they think they are and unable to control themselves without their help so confirming that they can be stable even as (technical) abominations and giving them more value will make it hard to control them.

From running other community events in the past (not /r/minnesotavikkngs) your best bet is come up with 2 ideas and create a poll. 

If you just ask for ideas you will have 20 people giving you 15 ideas and no consensus. The ideas you had were fantastic and based in “the thought” instead of monetary or material (which would be silly considering an NFL players income).  I would keep that idea moving forward, take your next favorite idea and pick between the two. 

Further more if/when an actual announcement gets posted about the gift basket include a mention about leaving get well messages. Worst comes to worse I will just make a subdomain on my current site and host it there. (My actual site has no front end content and no ads. There is no way for me to benefit)"

"This one is really specific, but here’s a great way to walk out of Seyda Neen with 1000+ Drakes (Money): so when you finish talking to the old man in the Census and Excise Office, directly on the right is a cupboard (I can’t remember the name but it’s right behind the table you pick up your papers on). There’s a plate that’s worth 650$. Right after taking your paper, walk over and Take it. But IMMEDIATELY AFTER TAKING IT, get into your inventory and Drop it. The guard will talk to you about illegal stuff and leave. You can now pick back up the Plate. It’s now yours, and nobody will arrest you for it. After leaving the office, (preferably taking literally everything in the second room) you take the ring in the barrel, talk to the imperial guard about Going to Caius Cascades, yadayada. Go outside. There’s a small wood elf named Fargoth who’s worried about his ring. Talk to him about the ring, and give it to him. After doing that, he’ll say he’ll tell his friend, Arille about you. Arille is the trader! The Biggest house in the center of town is the Tradehouse. Enter it. Directly in front of you’ll be Arille. Sell pretty much everything you don’t need (so all but the lockpick And the package for Caius Cascades) you’ll probably make out about 600-800$, thanks to fargoth telling him about you, making him like you, causing his buying prices to be lower and selling to be higher. If you’re worried about the ring, don’t worry. The up the stairs (to the left of Arille in his tradehouse) is a nord named Hrisskar Flat-Foot. Hrisskar needs to find Fargoths hiding place, and’ll give you a sum of the money he’s holding up there. Luckily for you, I know where it is. Behind Arille’a Tradehouse is 4 houses surrounding a Gross Pond, and in the pond is a big tree stump and small one. The big one is where he hides his stash. But sadly, it isn’t there, as he hasn’t put it away yet. Go inside the Big tower behind it, and up the steps. There’s a book and some bread. The book is worth a lot, so take it if you want. (Be careful, as on the bottom floor is a Lady, and she might see you steal it). Enter the door on the top of the stairs, and walk up the rest of the stairs. You’ll be on the top of the tower. Wait (using the waiting button) to around 8-11 pm. After 2-5ish minutes, Fargoth (the One with a torch who appears to be sneaking around) will eventually start wandering around, eventually to the Wood stump. He’ll stop there, stand for a few seconds, and leave. Now’s your chance. Get off the tower (either by jumping if you’re gutsy or running down the stairs) and get the stump, and take everything you’ll notice that his ring is also in the stump, and now yours. Now, what you’re doing to do, is NOT give it to Hrisskar. Just keep it for yourself. After all of this, you should have a decent amount of gold, maybe around 1,000. But don’t leave for Balmora like you were told just yet. There’s alotta quests in Seyda Neen (3 or 4). There’s even a dead body around near sedya Neen, and a bandit cave. Wander around the Seyda Neen area and get some experience. You might even level up. Once you feel ready for Big Balmora, you could either walk using the road, or use the big bug (silt strider, AKA the bus). And get to Balmora, and start your journey."

Reminds me of Trigun
"Mostly the former but also a bit of the latter.

By the looks they will be domestically pretty standard empires, nothing new - that we know of - there. And depending on your play style you can presumably play them as a more or less normal tall empire. But what is unique about them, is that they apparently can't expand too much (unlike every other empire type) and that they have the ability to have a symbiotic or parasitic relationship with the economies of other empires. I don't know how much you *have* to rely on that (I assume its too useful to ignore but probably is not something you need to do) but a reliance on that ability means that you are directly reliant on other empires' strength and to an extend have a stake in the success of other empires besides your own, you can't really grow into gaps left by others.

Now, Le Guin with its new tiered economy (with raw resources as well as manufactured ones) and expanded trade should allow for other empires besides Megacorps to be played tall as manufacturing hubs, relying on raw resources imports and buyers of manufactured goods. But unlike Megacorps those empires should be able to switch strategies and decide to expand. Now, Megacorps can kinda do this by proxies, via Vassals. You can already do that (vassalize others and don't integrate them), so maybe the differences aren't that big after all. But the parasitic/symbiotic play style will be unique, the question being how easy/hard it is to switch to heavy reliance on Vassals instead, especially in late game."

"The only ultralight I've flown is a Quicksilver MXL II so I can only share tips off of that. :) At the outset, I was told that training is imperative, as most people aren't used to the stick and pedal rudder controls. I had to take 30 hours of training, and even then, I had a difficult time with the stalls during my first flight and my landing was a far cry from being graceful. Hand and foot coordination is key, as well as mastery of the maneuvers and your position relative to the ground. My instructor said most people fly LSAs before trying out ultralight planes but it was the other way around for me. Sorry if I rambled on. I love flying but I know I've barely scratched the surface when it comes to aviation knowledge."

It depends on how its wired. If the switch tells the computer to turn the lights on then theoretically it could be programmed out. However if it's just a switch going to the lights then the switch needs to be replaced.

"The reason that the VHS tape became popular rather than the better quality Sony Betamax is because porn was published to VHS. 

The porn industry used VHS because Betamax only allowed for 60 minutes and they wanted longer videos. Ultimately Sony who owned Betamax did not allow for pornography to be published on Betamax tapes. 

The ability to watch porn at home was so thrilling that a vast portion of the population was willing to spend $600+ on a VCR to play their VHS tapes.

Don’t worry about Sony though. They killed HD DVDs with their Bluerays by making sure they jumped on the porn bandwagon early that time around. 

Additionally you can thank the porn industry for online payments. Selling porn online was a venture many thirsted for. Heh thirsted. Richard Gordon made it happen by inventing Electronic Card Systems the grandfather of online payments. This system was used to collect payments from horny creeps all over the world. If you’re at least my age (28) you remember the Pam &amp; Tommy Lee sex tape. Congratulations you were part of the group that made Gordon VERY rich.

"I can’t play the game without alternate start at this point haha. 

I chose the random start, and it gave me the necromancer beginning. You start out in Sinderion’s Field Lab with a Staff of Magelight, Circlet of Minor Magicka, Necromancer Robes, and Fur Boots of Minor Sneaking. You also have 5 Apples and some Potions. Inside the lab there is some loot of note. There is a Dwarven Dagger, Necklace of Knight, Necklace of Amara, Scroll of Summon Lightning Atronoch, Spellbook of Minor Ward, Spellbook of Conjure Familiar, Spellbook of Raise Corpse, a Potion of Brief Invisibility, and quite a few rare ingredients scattered about.

Unfortunately at the difficulty I like to play on, I had small chance of making my way to the lift out of Blackreach (even though it’s not very far). Right after you exit the lab, a Dwarven Sphere is waiting DIRECTLY in front of the door. Sometimes he lands that first hit before you can even move, sometimes it misses and you can run away. Unfortunately for me, the Sphere landed the hit and Matapoko died.

Alternate Start is fantastic if you like to RP while you play Skyrim! I have a save file of a character that just goes around in ragged clothes, scavenges stuff to sell during the day, and gets wasted at the nearest Inn at night... That’s the entire save file."

So this is for a command line program? You didn’t mention that. It’s unusual for such a program to keep running and listening for async events but okay.

The IOService notifications require a run loop so you need to have one active. Normally, NSApplication or UIApplication manages the run loop for you. But if you are writing a command line app then you need to manage the [NSRunloop](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsrunloop?language=occ) your self.

"Storytime: My girlfriend, when we were 19 or 20 years old, came into her room and sneezed so fucking hard, she bashed her forehead against the corner of her dresser. Cut her forehead open something gnarly. 

Now, I loved my girl at the time and would have taken a bullet for her, I got up off the bed and rushed to her aid. We put a towel on the cut, and her mom came in as I was dressing the wound.

She saw the amount of blood and said we need to get to the hospital, there could be more damage. (And needed stitches.)

We got to the hospital, and the nurse at the window asked what happened. My girlfriend now lightheaded couldn't make full sentences (concussion) tries to explain, I help and tell her what happened. The nurse gave me a nasty look, returned to my girlfriend and said, ""we can have him removed, if you need to tell us what happened in private.""

Clueless me, I walked away dumbfounded I was treated like that... I sit in the shitty hospital chairs, and her mom comes to me and tells me what they meant, that they assumed I did it to her and needed to hear it from her.

Anyway, fuck anyone who beats their girl, just fuck you for putting me and all men in that situation...

I'd say something shitty about her because she wasn't a great person near the end of our relationship. But it's 13 years later and her husband just committed suicide. So I think she's got a pretty shitty short end of the stick now. Sorry for your loss A."

Post Heresy I would assume fleet-based Chapters to be better at voidcraft than their planet bound brethren. Chapters like the Black Templars or Imperial Fists  should at least in theory be better at void war than someone like the Crimson Firsts or Excoriators."

"I must say I disagree, and I'm surprised how much support this is getting! Maybe it depends on how your company treats you and how your leave is managed year on year, but for me, taking sick days when I'm not sick *is* dishonest. I've agreed to work for this company x hours per week, and in return I get a salary, annual leave, and whatever else. In a perfect world I never take those sick days. When I leave the company they aren't paid out, nor should they be. They're just an assurance that I'll have a certain safety net should I become too sick to work.

Bundling leave and leaving it to the employees discretion seems unwise. If I take all my leave and then get the flu or hospitalised for some reason, is that just 'tough shit, come to work or get fired'? Companies don't want that. If you come in you're not at your best. They risk liability from further injury, or a fuck up you make in a codeine-induced haze, not to mention your illness could be quite contagious. So what do they do then? Force you to take leave without pay? That's legally dubious. Otherwise they suck it up and give you additional paid leave...

OR... they set aside leave that's not meant to be used, except to protect you and the company if unforeseen circumstances come about. It's just never seemed unfair to me. "

For my 7.1 system I would be sending audio to an avr, so just trying to find a way to keep 7.1 without my rips being 50% audio. Just feels silly that half or more of the file size would be audio. And yes I am aware that a lot of 4k Blu rays are upscaled, but those seem to encode very nicely and they offer more than just pure resolution, like hdr, that makes me care less about file sizes for them."

"I can see how you see this as demeaning. But I don't think it was intended that way. Though I agree it does put onus on the woman, rather than men like in an ideal world it should do. I actually think that works and here is why, it is advertising and most advertising puts the onus on the person that is targeted in the ad and that is women. I don't think it is intended to order women to not date, fuck or love certain men. But is designed to get the attention of women that will think when they see this ""I wish I could"" ""I hate when my boyfriend watches lots of porn and can't fuck me or can't be intimate."" or even ""There are feminists that are against porn?""

I think they chose it because it is a slogan and gets attention. I feel a question like ""Do you have a problem with porn in your relationship?"" would feel too medical. Where as this is a short concise statement in the hashtag advertising era and I wouldn't be surprised if this slogan had a facebook, twitter, instagram and website attached to it. It is designed to get women that agree that porn is a problem to them to come to their pages. And have a larger discussion around relationships and porn.

&gt;men who watch porn are dangerous to women' and say something about how this gives women an implied reason to not date them.

I actually think this would be less effective if I'm honest. Because it makes it seem dramatic and over the top. It also subtlety implies that if you get raped or abused and you're dating a man that watches porn. You might bare some of the responsibility.

I also think men aren't going to listen to women as a collective group about porn. There is a reason why men listen to Terry Crews and not Gail Dines. Even when Terry Crews has remarked on fairly feminist sounding statements like ""Porn makes you see people as body parts""

It is a hard message to craft and still keep it slogan worthy.

That's the allure to draft picks and why it's so important to hit on them.  They allow you to fill your team with far more talent if you can actually find good players because they're so damn cheap. 

A good example of this is Seattle.  They stopped competing for SB's when Wilson went from getting paid $800K / yr and actually started making QB money because they no longer could afford to keep all of their elite players else where. "

"The patch notes you linked me say nothing about Ninja damage being buffed. They buffed *Summon Damage by 30 AP for all classes with summons*, but Ninja has no summons. What are you trying to infer from these patch notes?

Ninjas and Strikers have always been able to punch up, that was always a thing. Not nearly as easily as with Renown, but it was definitely doable. People flocked to Ninja because we still hadn’t had the bulk of our safety stripped from our skills, and we have a shit-ton of CC’s to engage with safely (including some protected cc’s), and disengage if they don’t work out.

You must be on a different Reddit/Forums from me, because I see constant bitching about stealth. I rarely see complaints about iFrames, although they would be just as valid for Sorcs in that regard. The damage is definitely out of control, but it comes with the whole being made out of paper thing.

I think you’re taking these patch notes entirely out of the context of their time. The outrage had little to do with the damage, and a lot to do with how easy it was to do that damage.

If you can actually point to the portion of those notes that indicate we somehow got a damage buff, then great, I’ll concede. But I read all of the All Classes changes and all of the Ninja changes, and I see nothing about buffed damage whatsoever."

"You’re off topic to what I’m speaking on. It’s not about disrobing in front of peers unless circumstances such as these present themselves. Outsourcing a female volunteer to practice on would mitigate any discomfort, I totally agree. 

However, performing certain protocols on one another will help you learn and understand the intricacies of it. Being tactile with whatever you’re learning helps with the understanding of how it’s done. To add to that knowledge base, role playing as the patient in what you’re trying to grasp also assists in that learning process. Especially in the medical field. Any hands on process should be learned from both regards so you as the medical professional knows what the patient is feeling. I know it’s just an EKG lab, but this type of thinking and out cry is not helping you learn it. 

As far as not knowing any medical professionals who have disrobed in front of there peers? I am sorry you don’t. I know plenty. As a matter of fact, I know the best. I trained along side them. And when females came through to learn, they disrobed too. No pressure to. They knew that when you’re working on a patient, any chance you get to play both roles, you’re that much better than the residents getting out of medical school. 

I was in the emergency room tonight because of one of my employees. The resident working in him was too busy trying to recall the “proper” dressing processors but poor kid was nervous as hell. I had to talk him through putting on an appropriate pressure dressing. The kid was just wrapping cloth on an arterial bleed. What I’m getting at is if he would have roll played as a patient in med school,  maybe I would have been there tonight to make my employee comfortable and check in on him as opposed to being that young residents assistant.

"From a tourist’s perspective, FWIW:

The sidebar and links posted here are largely how I planned my &amp; my boyfriend’s first trip to Philly this summer. Take them to heart. 

We stayed in what Google Maps tells me is Callowhill/Chinatown. We walked everywhere*, it was centrally located enough between Independence Hall/Art Museum/walking &amp; eating in Center City/Rittenhouse/Logan Square 

We ate at every cheesesteak place we could find and split the sandwich. Most sandwiches experienced + least dollars spent + more room for sandwiches later = success. Also I still dream of the lobster roll from Luke’s Lobster. I wish we had tried the Nigerian &amp; Thai places our hotel bartender recommended, but we had a fever and the only remedy was more cheesesteak. 

If we were going to do the Liberty Bell over again I’d get there before it technically opens and wait. The line seemed to grow exponentially and we only got there shortly after open. 

We ate breakfast at Beiler’s Bakery in Reading Terminal Market many of the days because Fruity Pebble donuts. (That may or may not be why we didn’t get to the Liberty Bell before open.)

Touristy things we did:

Art Museum / Rodin Museum

Liberty Bell

Independence Hall

Obligatory Tourist Couple Photo in Love Park

Mütter Museum

Wagner Free Institute of Science* - we walked there but got a Lyft back, a strong Do Not Recommend for walking but 12/10 would go to the institute again. "

Weimar Germany in particular confounded state funded strikes (paying people *not* to work) with large purchases (money printing) of assets to pay back war reparations. It did not go well. At least from memory.

A basic income is not as bad as paying people not to work, but it's not as safe as simply ensuring a minimum wage, attainable by anyone willing to work."

"&gt; its a slippery slope.

I don't think so. Almost every animal life form is flexible enough to eat something else when a particular food source species becomes extinct. Our planet's environment isn't fragile, otherwise life would have become extinct a billion years ago.

In 1894 the Times predicted “[In 50 years](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Great-Horse-Manure-Crisis-of-1894/), every street in London will be buried under nine feet of manure.” London is still there and free of horse manure. Do you really think a 1,000 year prediction for sea level change will hold when a 50 year prediction for horse manure failed so miserably? "

Just need the light one to make an evo 3, but the soulstones don't seem to be appearing in the shop for me. So far i've only amassed 20. So, what is the better strategy, to refresh until I get 30 more, or just fork out the 990 gems for the package?"

"&gt; Glocks grip angle kills me

Lol. 

I 100% respect the fact that Glocks aren't perfect for everyone, but don't blame *grip angles.*  I know you've heard a lot of people say it, but it's a fallacy.  Out of the entire pistol market, most pistols have a grip angle that falls between ~5° in difference (most are less than that).  Glocks are pretty middle-of-the-road, with a grip angle of ~110° (+/- 2°, depending on exactly how you're taking that measurement).  If you can honestly tell the difference between the grip angle of a CZ, 1911, and Glock just by picking them up and putting a few shots downrange at a target that's only 15 feet away, then my hat is off to you. You're a *far* better shooter than anyone on this subreddit.  

Let's pretend that you're actually Wesley Gibson himself and you can tell the difference between the Glock grip angle and anything else.  If that was true, you would be shooting one inch high or low, with a fantastic group.  If that was the case, you could solve the issue by using a [front sight with a different height.](http://stores.kensight.com/front-sight-height-guide/)  "

1. The lighting is great, very bright. But unfortunately your whole face is deeply shadowed and it makes it tough to see your face and your Emotions at all.  

2. You have a good Mic, no static and people can hear you loud and clear, your Voice is really nice. Sadly you don't talk much, or when you say something, it is some mumbling or sometimes quiet singing. Which is a good sign that you notice the silence yourself, but you don't know what to say. So speak up, talk about your next step, what is happening on the screen. I know it's easy to keep the ball rolling when you have people in there talking to you. But if you don't want to go mad by not having anyone in chat, learn talking to yourself, constantly.  

3. Now this is tough, because you probably can't do much about it, your Bitrate and with that the Quality of the stream, is really bad the moment you move, or reach a green (mostly grass) area and do fast Camera movements. I don't know how much your Internet can handle, but it's barley watchable. I can't only imagine how the stream must look like with fast movement Games like Warframe.  

4. Please change your title, you don't need 100 followers. You should know that by now, giving your comment regarding your twitter followers. Dead followers do certainly look nice, but don't do anything. So the more you ask for followers, the higher the chance that people might give it to you, but then never return just so you stop asking. Pretty sure that's not your Goal.

"&gt;Would you blame the media and DNC if a crazy person tried to kill Republicans because they are racist nazis trying to turn the US into Nazi Germany?

&gt;Would you blame the crazy person or the DNC and media for their polarizing rhetoric?

Yes.
&gt;The guy who opened fire on the republican softball team, was that the fault of the dnc and media's claim they are deplorable racists ruining the country?

This is the closest thing I could find to describe his motives:
&gt;On May 22, 2017, Hodgkinson wrote ""Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It's Time to Destroy Trump &amp; Co."" above his repost of a Change.org petition demanding ""the legal removal"" of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for ""treason"". He belonged to numerous political Facebook groups, including those named ""Terminate the Republican Party,"" ""The Road To Hell Is Paved With Republicans,"" and ""Donald Trump is not my President.""[57]

From the Wiki article on the shooting. Not much talk of Nazis frankly. Some fringe Facebook groups on no level comparable with Infowars."

"I am super interested by the Trichocereus plants right now so if anyone could provide me with a decently sized seedling that i can grow into my own mescaline factory i would be very appreciative of that. Im not so excited by the lophophora plants though, they grow much too slow even when grafted and depending on conditions they can contain just the same amount or slightly more than the easier to handle Trichocereus, with the stats from the NAC (native american church, these guys collect peyote for spiritual purposes) their peyote range at around 3% which a san pedro (although not so common) could beat. Im not bashing the peyote gang and i think they are some truely beutiful plants but i dont feel like they are the type of plant to be abused like they are. Peyote has been ravaged by collectors and with their astoundingly slow growth rate its very hard for them to recover even if the collector takes proper procedures to not kill the plant and only take the button. 

Well im done with this rant now peyote is still a very fine plant but i couldnt do it."

"&gt;Not everyone is as virtuous as you.  Many Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck and can't afford additional taxation to help complete strangers whom we know very little about.
&gt;
&gt;Moreover, even if we cut Military Defense spending, which seems like a great place to start,  you can't just pay for these people to live in a spot of your choosing without the local populace questioning why the new arrivals are getting special treatment.
&gt;
&gt;Everything sounds noble by intention, but the reality is far more complicated than ""no human is illegal"".  Society only functions because there are basic rules *most of us* play by.

It's not virtue, it's basic economics. We - like the vast majority of Americans - live paycheck to paycheck, and don't have any savings. If our taxes went up, we would spend less on the luxuries. No swimming class for both kids at the same time, no Blue Apron once a week, my coffee budget would be gone, that sort of thing. It's not some Noble Intention that leads me to want my taxes to go up to cover this, it's a rational evaluation of our financial situation: We can afford more, and the sacrifices we'd make are paltry compared to the amount of good that could be done for so many people who are worse off than us.

We (as a society) spend a lot of resources punishing people we think have hurt society, I wish we prioritized helping people half as much."

"Yeah, as long as you are feeling the burn and not ego lifting. It's pretty common to lift heavy and slightly decrease each set to get maximum pump, just make sure you aren't just jumping straight in. Start with some smaller weights first of course. Also, recent research and ancedotes suggest that you should do dynamic stretches prior to lifts and static stretches afterward, sorry this is kinda irrelevant.

Also, I would make sure that when you shrug you are getting full range of motion. I also like to lower the weight a tad bit and hold the peak briefly. I see a lot of people do shrugs half-assed. They are light and I personally find them extremely easy, but always keep form and ROM in check. "

"You obviously do not grasp economics.  Artificially inflating wages just leads to - inflation! What good does it do to double your pay, if everything you buy including rent also doubles in price? If it happens as a product of the job market being advantageous to workers because of there being more jobs than people to fill them, wages go up for low income workers, and yes, inflation would rise, but not drastically or immediately, and employers would absorb at least some of the increased price of labor with cost savings elsewhere, not just by hiking prices. So yes, when the government's policies reduce the flow of cheap illegal alien labor, reduces taxes and regulations that stifle job growth, you get more jobs and less people available to fill them = wage growth.  Free markets work, you can't just legislate higher wages without consequences."

This, and other advantages that assure that being in the military is one of the few ways of having a stable life in the chaos that is ravaging Venezuela, is part of why the army is so fiercely loyal to the government. Not to mention that the whole chavista movement is inherently an ""army thing"". Chavez and his goons in the army tried to assassinate the president in 1992, for instance. Effectively, the Venezuelan army is an oppressive ruling class of the country, to simplify things a bit."

"He's not wrong about not knowing what to say in a GTA game these days.

I've played GTA Online a lot, and they've added radio stations and so on, but the original ones are still there, a little time capsule to 2013, and it was such a simpler time. Which feels crazy to say, but seriously, think about it. Pre-Trump, Pre-Brexit, the world looked sort of stable. I mean we know it was the calm before the storm now, but I remember sometimes back then almost feeling hopeful.

For example the politics in GTA V is way more sensible than reality. They swung for the fences as a satire, and the fences just moved, and they moved *fast*. And this is something that has happened to great modern satirists like Chris Morris not just guys like Houser. Modern culture and politics are in a state where you can't really satirise them because they're just too fucked.

Another example, the cops in GTA V. What they say, what they do. They have police cars with ""Obey and survive"" written on them. That'd be almost a funny joke, except that now there are police cars operating in the USA with Punisher inspired skull motifs on them. Big ones. There are cops in the USA with squad cars with giant skulls on them. How do you satirise that? (edited to add, the cops did get rid of the logos eventually, but the whole Blue Lives Matter thing remains freakish)

The world is losing its shit and it is losing its shit fast. We saw this with how GTA lost its edges and its relevance faster than an ice sculpture. It's the biggest media product in history, and the story, the single player side of it, that's been discarded way quicker than other games in the series. Even Rockstar themselves binned plans for single player expansions.

And he's correct that right and left are much more militant than before. I mean, are we not angry? Are they not angry? Where is the lie here? I wouldn't take this comment as a bad thing. He *knows* he will get called on bullshit in his games now, that's good. That's progress. He might not like it but he accepts it, and that's all you're going to get from some people.

Ultimately though, yeah, I see his point. I would not want to be making GTA 6 in this environment. A game with a development cycle like that would be out of step with current events probably three times in the space of its own production."

And how am I going to get people around me to pay attention when all of them are already voting R because that's what their church told them to do? What am I gonna do, try to convince my coworkers and get fired for it (friends already don't vote and if I press it any more than I already have they'll likely be ex-friends).

You guys in decent states or decent countries could let us escape, but no any time I say I want to get out of here to the west coast I get a million comments of ""no, stay out, we're full!""

"Definitely interesting. I wonder if they could implement so machine learning into the AI so that they get better lap by lap, understanding how the users are driving. I guess that's what drivatars were supposed to do in the first place... 

The course that I made had a jagged line one of  the checkpoints (because I had to drive backwards and was messy) which made the racing line red, but in reality could just blast through it. 

At the start of the race the AI braked (broke?) there but at the 10th lap they didn't. Maybe they do have some machine learning over the course of a single race. Or maybe it's because they already were on the racing line as we weren't one pack after 10 laps anymore.

I think this needs to be underlined in red.  Conservative dogma has long said ""you can't burden businesses, because then they'll retaliate by moving or getting rid of jobs!""  They understand that unilaterally putting a burden on people will make them return fire, and refuse to entertain the notion of increasing corporate taxes because it's a cold 'fact' that there's nothing you can do to stop businesses from acting out.  Yet somehow, putting the burden on people who lack the means to retaliate financially is seen as reasonable because what can they do?  ***This*** is what they can do, and by all conventional logic what they *would* do.  You don't push someone around, tell them ""because I said so, now fuck off"", and just assume nothing will happen."

Right now you can click on a tab and while continuing to hold down the mouse button, start shifting it over and then at the same time click the left or right arrow keys to speed that up. It's pretty bad but it kinda works especially if you hold the right arrow and drag the mouse to the left or visa versa to speed up the tab shift."

This would give all windows access to those bookmarks, not just the private windows.

You'd probably also need to check on startup to make sure the ""private"" bookmarks weren't left in the tree due to the browser shutting down, or to see if the currently open window is a private window."

"It used to be that if you pointed your Move tip anywhere from 91-180 degrees back, you went backwards. And the less of an angle you pointed at, the slower you'd move. You could play entirely with wrist movement, and had a lot of control (sideways too). The entire Move wand behaved like a giant joystick. And everyone loved that. Especially in fights.

Now if you point anywhere from about 91-179 degrees back, you'll go FORWARDS, and it'll be headset relative. New bugs.

You can still go back if you use more of your arm to actually point 180 degrees back. Very awkward and slow. Terrible in a fight. And you can no longer control your speed of movement.

Add to this degradation and bug, the fact that some people can't strafe, because Skyrim is now extremely sensitive to exactly how you manipulate the Move wand, and it's a real screw-up. All to give us useless in-game hands. Even if you disable them, you're stuck with the new, degraded, buggy controls."

"**Craniopagus parasiticus**

Craniopagus parasiticus is an extremely rare type of parasitic twinning occurring in about 4 to 6 of 10,000,000 births. In craniopagus parasiticus, a parasitic twin head with an undeveloped body is attached to the head of a developed twin. Fewer than a dozen cases of this type of conjoined twin have been documented in literature. Most infants with this condition are stillborn, or die shortly after birth.

"**Euthyphro and Socrates: The Sandwich**  
— Well, Socrates, I am happy to tell you what a sandwich is, as I have great knowledge of these things as you know.  
— Thank you, Euthyphro, I will be glad to listen to you, for you are a learned man and I am just a poor beggar. So tell me, please, how can we know that which is a sandwich, apart from those things that are not sandwiches?  
— Socrates, it could not be more simple. A sandwich is anything edible held in a container that is also edible.  
— I see; that is very clear indeed. So this taco is a sandwich.  
— No Socrates, that is a taco. A sandwich is something quite different, as you may quickly see by noting that they are called by different names.  
— And yet, Euthyphro, here we have some soy ground beef—surely this is edible—and as you see, it is held in this container, which is a fried tortilla, and which I eat along with the material inside. Surely this is a sandwich!  
— Well, Socrates, that is not quite right. I will try to be more clear: a sandwich is that which is edible, held in a container made of bread, surely.  
— So then this hot dog, of course, is a sandwich. Thank you, Euthyphro!  
— Well Socrates… a hot dog is something very like a sandwich, and yet it does not seem to me to be exactly a sandwich either, somehow. I see where you have misunderstood—let me clarify. A sandwich consists of some edible material, in between TWO pieces of bread, which must be separate from one another.  
— I see; that is very clear indeed. So this pizza placed face down atop this other pizza, this is a sandwich.  
— No, Socrates, I see that you do not understand at all. That is nothing like a sandwich.  
— Now Euthyphro, how can this be? For truly here I see edible items—those are cheese, tomato sauce, and vegan pepperoni—and they are indeed to be found in between two pieces of bread—that is the pizza crust. How can this not be a sandwich, then?  
— Well, Socrates, you have twisted my words around somehow. I did not mean ANY edible items in between ANY type of bread; I meant something rather more specific.  
— Now Euthyphro, you are teasing a poor old man. You told me you would explain what a sandwich was, so that I might learn from your wisdom, yet now you seem to have told me nothing at all.  
— Socrates, I will try to explain so that you might understand. A sandwich must be easily held in the hands, whereas two pizzas atop one another, as I’m sure you can see, are quite impossible to hold easily in the hands, as the whole is much too large and floppy.  
— Ah, thank you Euthyphro, now I feel we are getting somewhere. Truly, now I think I understand. If a sandwich is something edible in between two pieces of bread, with the whole composed in such a way as to be easily held within the two hands, then obviously three pieces of bread, held together in the hands, is a sandwich.  
— I do not see what you mean, Socrates. Surely a stack of pieces of bread is simply a loaf of bread, as any man knows.  
— Now Euthyphro, you seem to be teasing me again, for look, here is a piece of edible bread, placed in between two other pieces of bread, the whole of which, you must agree, I hold quite easily in my hands, withered and shaking though they may be.  
— Well Socrates, it is true, now that I think on it, that these three pieces of bread do in fact ascribe to my earlier definition. And yet, anyone could tell you that this is not a sandwich.  
— Then Euthyphro I think you must start over, if you are ever to help me understand. Come now, don’t keep an old man waiting. Surely one as learned as you should easily be able to explain what a sandwich is to a poor old fool such as myself. Please begin again, and this time try to be more clear.  
— Socrates I really must go, I will be late for my appointment."

She seems to be moving on well because she has the dude she cheated you on with; it's easy to refocus herself. This hippie thing is gonna wear off and she'll start to ask herself why she thought it was a good decision to leave something so stable for something that is just a heat of the moment.

"If you are below the threshold to deduct traditional IRA contributions, I would definitely go:

* Traditional 401k up to company match
* Traditional IRA to $5,500 ($6,000 in 2019 I think)
* Max out Traditional 401k up to $18,500 ($19k in 2019?)

So if your income after your 401k contributions is under $63,000 if single, or $101,000 if married, you are eligible for the full deduction for IRA contributions, and you should use traditional across the board.

Good read on why Roth sucks for the majority.
https://www.gocurrycracker.com/roth-sucks/

The reason traditional is better for most is that most people's income in retirement is a lot less than when they're working. Also, if you plan on retiring early at all, you can use the years between the time you stop working and when you start pulling from retirement accounts to do a Roth conversion ladder and transfer money from traditional to Roth tax free. So you basically never have to pay taxes on a portion of it."

"Yes, the exp requirements (for all things, not just adventurers) is exponential or something like it. Click on the white circle icon next to the adventurer's exp bar to show you total exp progress — you'll see that 50 out of 80 levels only accounts for like 1/4 of total exp, and so getting from 50 to 60 costs just as much exp as getting from 1 to 50. (Those are not precise numbers, but you get the idea)  


The reason for this is that it's very easy to get a character/dragon/etc into the ""viable"" stat range so that they're useful in battle.

She gains wrinkles etc? A spouse should be loved trancedently from their physical form &amp; that sexual attraction also lies in this space. If an aspect of who she is has changed, i.e. partking in unhealthy lifestyle choices, it is understandable for the lessening of attraction.

"1.  Make sure you have next gen firewall that has the current firmware and has proper policies configured on it. And constantly update the policies.  
2.  Make sure each computer has centralized antivirus that can be monitored
3.  Make sure each computer has centralized anti malware that can be monitored.
4. Make sure all the operating systems and apps like Adobe flash, java, adobe reader and so on are up to date.
5.  Make sure company has up to date security policy
6.  Make sure the firewall has IPS/IDS, content and app filtering turned on and configured
7.  Make sure to have email anti spam in place.
8. Make sure the group policy on the server and computers are configured properly.

The above is the basic that each company needs to have.  In addition for better security you need to have:

1. 24/7 server and network log monitoring via siem 
2. Monthly Vulnerability scanning
3. Monthly phish threat
4. Continuous employee security training
5. Data loss prevention 
6. Quarterly risk assessment 

A lot of MSP and mom-pop shops claim that they can also handle security.  80% of the time they can’t, and that’s because security is a whole different world.  So it might be better for you to bring a company that actually knows security.

We go to so many prospects that their old MSP didn’t configure anything properly and they claimed they can provide security services."

This is a great place for the arts, too! There's the museum, and the Lyndon House... Even local businesses host art shows. Avid Books hosts a lot of authors (David Sedaris was here... last year, I want to say?). Oh! That's right, it's a great place if you write, too; I'm part of the local branch of Word of Mouth. Of course, we're known for our music scene -- there are a lot of great local bands, and a lot of other artists perform here, too. So far this year I've seen Family and Friends (local), Kishi Bashi (also based here), Bleachers, Twin Peaks, Brandi Carlisle (with Darlingside, one of my favorite bands of all time). Seeing The Oh Hellos tomorrow, and then Tall Heights in November... Got Walk the Moon and Lord Huron lined up for next year. ...A lot of popular artists perform here, is what I'm saying (and even more in Atlanta). Oh, and if you perform your own music, there're a lot of open mic nights and ways to break in.

&gt;Because that is what is being discussed.

One of the things being discussed.

&gt;If you believe private sector R&amp;D is just faith, then the same must be true for government. Government doesn't magically come up with good solutions just because you throw money at it.

I'm not sure where you are misunderstanding me. We know the private sector does little if any long-term basic research and we know goverment funding works. For example, [look at the history of solar power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power#Early_days).


&gt;Every large corporation plans years or decades in advance. Many small ones do, also.

Ok, I'll concede the point.

&gt;Of course it was known that CO2 had a warming influence. But, as the temperature had been declining for a 35 years, no one cared. That isn't propaganda. Temperature declined during between the early 1940s and the late 1970s. Government investment comes from politicians, not scientists. Maybe I should have been more clear when I said ""people"" before. No politician was talking about global warming in the 1970s. There was no way politicians were going to tax people to put money toward fighting some supposed global warming which may or may not happen when the temperature was going the other way and there were far more pressing concerns.

The temperature did not decline, there was a sharp spike in the early 40s but the graph speaks for itself: https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/

Exxon Mobiles own scientists were warning about CO2 emissions in [1977](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/). Of course, it does not help that they not only kept it hidden but have been funding misinformation campaigns ever since.

I'll be honest I'm not sure that politicians would have given a shit if it was not for the oil crisis but the science has not changed much."

"So after having finally seen the rest of the show I can come to a decision here and I agree with you too. Re-watching the first few seasons I can see where they put the foundations in early on, and anything with Archer kinda ends up confusing me except if I interpret it in more of a father-figure kind of way. Anyway, the way I see T'Pol is, she's not just suppressed, she's also actually _crushingly shy_. Not professionally, that's a different story, anyone can be professional. But WHOLE different level of weirdness when it comes to any kind of interpersonal exchange, no matter the relative level of intimacy. Unlike other Vulcans in the franchise she did not even have the opportunity to go through the Academy and become socialized to humans, it is actually a real culture shock to her and I think she actually demonstrates an admirable level of compassion despite it. Consider ""Breaking the Ice"" and the clearly unkind words that Vanik had to say to her after dinner as he abruptly leaves, but her reaction is to not bad an eyelash except to exhibit faint regret. I do think that the will-they-won't-they with Trip was a little cheesey, but c'mon, Star Trek needs SOME cheese. But that her actual curiosity about humans and attraction to him was beginning to become clearer. I really liked that Trip was not actually attracted to her at first, as demonstrated when Malcolm -- the pervy one -- mentioned her to him. Even if the neuropathic sessions were an excuse to spend time together, and also filmed a little cheesily, it was sincere, and their attraction grew from getting to know each other. Even if she still doesn't dig the monster movies.... "

"Sounds like you're making yourself an excuse to not do right on your own; you are taking the lazy approach in not correcting what's wrong about you instead of non-selfish self improvement.

As an extreme example, this is like saying ""I'll do the time for the crime because that's the only way to break free"" by viciously murdering an orphanage after brutally strangling each child because they laughed at you on the way to work in traffic from their communal bus ride.  Yes you are going to be jailed for that and it'll stop you from potentially doing that again, but all you had to do was to shrug it off and/or a better person to begin with and you pay no price compared to the extreme penalty incurred.

Your approach is flawed and it seems you aren't so well adjusted.  This suggest a potential pattern that can carry over to other situations in your life, not just in a game, but if it's isolated to you just playing DotA, maybe the game (and probably any stressful, discordant situation) isn't for you after all."

"How many spots on the image plane at which you’re measuring the light can you resolve? This answer is basically the same answer to the question of how high an OAM mode number you can detect. The OAM mode number is how many times the phase of the wavefront changes from 0 to 2pi around the beam circumference. To detect an OAM mode, the phase at each angular position around the beam must be spatially non-overlapping with the adjacent light: if it weren’t there would be destructive cancellation of the wave intensity. 

So if you can spatially separate the output aperture of the light source into approximate 10 sectors, then you can access an OAM mode number of approximately +/-5 (because you need 0 and pi to be spatially separated). 

As a side note, if you have an image preserving optical system that is capable of transmitting more than one OAM mode, then technically you can also just use spatial multiplexing to send the exact same amount of data. IE, divide the input aperture into the same number of channels as OAM modes that you planned to use, and send the exact same amount of data through a number of completely spatially separated RX/TX pairs. 

As a practical matter OAM modes may be easier to separate with some kinds of hardware, because they’re insensitive to absolute rotation of the image plane (which is going to happen in any fiber). 

But show me a _truly_ single mode OAM channel or _truly_ point-like OAM transmitter or receiver and I’ll eat my hat. An OAM system is a spatially separated multimode medium, pure and simple. "

The BC NDP wants the MLA to be in place before February budget speech rolls around in 2019.

https://vancouversun.com/news/politics/nanaimo-byelection-to-occur-before-february-says-horgan/

There is also a need to resign before nomination closes for the byelection as one can't run for MLA while being MP under the BC law though one can argue the loopholes.

The fixed term federal election is October 21, 2019, and a federal by election must be called within 11 days to 180 days in receiving the notice of a vacancy.

Sure. There are ways to avoid the federal byelection or merge it with the general election, but the timeline is really tight given the circumstances and most attempt to avoid one would create some bad optics for someone and it relies on the BC NDP and LPC cooperating.

The word is the Leeds—Grenville—Thousand byelection would be announced before next week is up and the Burnaby South by election will be lump with that one, so maybe the BC NDP will keep it close until then. However, I am having difficult finding a path to no federal byelection in Nanaimo Ladysmith as well using the current timeline."

My commentary was skimming on the full picture:  These vehicles also have multiple sets of cameras which are responsible for reading lane markings and traffic signals/signs.

As far as your situation goes, communication is key in a relationship. If you can't communicate like adults, any long-term relationship is doomed. If you are going to spend the rest of your life (or a good portion of it) with this person, you need to be comfortable being entirely yourself and expressing your emotions without fear. If neither one of you is comfortable, you should at least take a bold step and say it. Say, ""I am not comfortable being entirely myself or expressing my feelings to you, and I want to be. I also want you to have the same safety in our relationship because I care about you."" I'd recommend making it very clear that you're not blaming them, because it ultimately doesn't matter one bit whose fault it is. This goes beyond just this thing too. Any time you have a problem with your SO, make it clear that it may or may not be their fault that you feel that way. Your emotional issues can be your fault as well. Again, fault doesn't matter in most cases. Being committed to always making an honest effort to work things out together is the most important thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd talk to your SO about how you've been feeling the last month. Figure out what it is that is bothering her about you. If you really didn't do whatever she is mad about, make that clear, and then apologize that it seemed that way. That apology may not be good enough for her, but at least you've apologized where you can.

&amp;#x200B;

"I was in the same shoes. I’ll probably get hate for this but I really love my girlfriend and did not want to leave her. However the weight bothered me so much and I never said anything for awhile but pretending nothings wrong is worse. I tried so many things like trying to get her to go to the gym with me, explaining how to eat healthy, etc. However nothing worked. I sat her down and was quite blunt that I loved her and no matter what she looked like that would never change. Unfortunately I have trouble being attracted to someone who is fat, because that is in jeopardy for our sex lives sake I really need you to work on it just like how I work on it every day by eating healthy and working out. She of course was upset at first but she loves me too and for my sake she started to lose weight. 

I truly think that sometimes you need to get pushed by the one you care about most because that’s the only person who can get you to change your ways. Now she is so appreciative that I said something because we really progressed as a couple. We communicate and work on our problems and tell the other when something about the other upsets them, and solve it together.

I suggest being honest but tactful of course. I hope this story helps, good luck!"

"The logical error that insurance is based on the experience of the driver. That may play some part of it but it’s minor because an elderly driver with 60 years behind the wheel should present practically no risk, yet we both know that’s not true. Simply put, young males (in general) are more risky because they have too much testosterone, cannot always grasp the end results of their actions and I’ll concede have less experience driving, and so their rates are higher than females of the same age. Females tend to develop faster than males and mature earlier. This is applicable to Hogg only insofar as he is 17 and likely does not have the foresight to know that he is not setting himself up for a good life. Why? Because he is too young to grasp the results of their actions much like a 17 year old boy that speeds down the highway or texts and drives or drives impaired or blows through a stop sign."

"Very happy with the UCL we have been having. I like our intensity!! But I am still very wary of our 433 with these particular players. Real Sociedad, Girona, Leganes, Athletic Bilbao and Valencia games were consequences of our vulnerability in counters. Hell that Tottenham 4-2 was amazing offensively but it couldve been 3-3 if Messi hadnt byried that. Now I am happy with Arthur as an interior. Busquets too as always great! But here is the thing. Our attacks are very centrally based. Which annoys me because our full backs go up to cover those gaps and our interiors are far up too and we get fucked in counters at times unless Pique or Lenglet or MATS do something amazing but still risky imo. Specially that right wing gap... Also Coutinho really does not seem comfortable as a LW. Last year his interplay and cut ins were great and he had space for it since both holding mids (Busi and Raki) dropped deeper. Also, Rakitic doesnt have that great interior tempo Id like to see... but is amazing as dpuble pivot. Imo our 442 and 4231 was very stable defensively thanks to Busquets and Rakitic helping out. Also Dembele played so well there as right mid with Semedo covering defensively on the right. All Im saying is not that I want to change to 442/4231, but some matches, with our great bench, we can do so. Remember Girona vs Barca last yrar? That 6-1 was magic. Coutinho played so well. Everyone did. Just a thought. This 433 is offensively quick yes. But vulnerable in defense aigainst counter attacking teams. For example last Sevilla match, Ter Stegen saved us from being 4-3. Also, whats concerning is the number of goals we conceded this year compared to last one. 11 this one. 3 last year. And we are losing points. We have 18 only right now... We are first yes but it helps others are doing so badly. Idk Im still wary and Im judt wondering if theres something Im missing and i you guys think this formstion is fine??? Right now RM havent been lethal in the front, so I'll gladly stick to this 433 aigainst them. Just that there is lack of width on the right and our 442/4231 could help with that. Also for Coutinhos comfort and Raki's. Btw, if we continue in 433, can we rest Rakitic someday?? Vidal is eager to play and is a beast! Also I agree with Rafinha for aigainst RM. Because Dembele right now is mentally not prepared. Its all mental that game aigainst Sevilla. Needs to be on his tiptoes more and ready and aware. Like Valdes the staff helped him eith that and positioning and he became a legend. Now Malcom provides width but I doubt he is ready for RM cuz of the lack of playtime. Anyways. What do you guys think? I believe that Girona game couldve been repeated but we ended up tying this season aigainst them smh. Now if you dislike this formation and everything, please explain how we can manage with this 433 with these players cuz Im scared we are gonna get bitten in the ass later on. And in CL. Right now we are getting it in La Liga. Almost did aigainst Sevilla. However I must say offensively we are on fire. I do think however we could be more solid with that other formation defensively and use a right flak with width. Also could be better for rotations.  Vidal for Raki,  Rafinha for Coutinho, Arthur for Busi and Malcom for Dembouz. Also Munir for Suarez. The obvious defending subs and keeper sub. But 433 we have Coutinho and Messi as undisputed wingers and 3 other ones in the bench with talent. And in the mid we could rotate but Vidal still never plays being theonly mdifield sub possible at the moment. Idk I feel our other formation was solid and good for rotations, I remember Chelsea 3-0 and Juve 3-0 as wll as Real 3-0... seriously it was solid offensiveky and great defensively

EDIT: This 442/4231 needs Messi though as striker/centrr firward so our RM line up should ressemble the one from today since they havent been very lethal. But Id like to see the other formation from time to time. Also Arthur or Vidal, like Paulinho, can play as RM sometimes if you feel Coutinho Suarez Messi Dembele is too much offensiveky and not enough defensively

“What’s the plan Ruby?” asked Blake.

“Don’t let anyone else die!”

“Ruby, that’s not a plan, that’s a mission statement!” Weiss screamed at her. 

“I know,” Ruby replied, turning away from the manticores advancing down the train to look at her. “But if I told you what I planned, you would say no!”

Weiss paled. “Ruby no, no no no! Nora said she threw up four times!”

Ruby ignored her, turning to Blake and Yang. “Bumblebee Mark 4!” she shouted over the roar of the wind. Both girls nodded, Yang blasting into the air and Blake speeding down the train. 

Wiess backed away as Ruby faced her. “Ruby…argh!” she screamed as a stream of red petals barrelled into her, lifting her off her feet. 

Time had stopped, everything frozen around them. Ruby guided her around the train, grip firm on her arm, both girls running on the side of the carriage. She seemed to be surrounded by a blue of petals, red and white. Weiss reached out, placing a hand against Ruby’s stomach. She needed to stop, to think, this was all too much. 

Then she felt it. A burst of emotion. Concern, anxiety. Desperation. Love. Hope. Joy. 

Weiss pulled her hand away, her mind going blank. 

“Weiss? Weiss!”

---

She had pulled herself together. There had been a battle to fight, her team, the passengers, they needed her. They had saved who they could, but it hadn’t been enough. It was never enough. Almost half the passengers on the train lost to the Grimm, JNR and Qrow left behind to cover their retreat and look after the remainder. RWBY had pushed on with Oscar and the relic, heading towards a town where Qrow knew an old woman who might be able to help them.

“This cave looks good,” Ruby called from up ahead. “It’s empty and there’s several small caverns inside”. 

Weiss trudged along at the rear, Blake holding her arm, pulling her forward. Her mind remained at the battlefield. 

*‘I felt…her,’* she realised. *‘Her feelings, her emotions. How is that possible?*’

She let Blake guide her inside the cavern and Ruby dashed over to take her hand. She smiled at the warmth of her girlfriends’ fingers. *‘How does she always have such warm hands, even in this weather?’*

“Thanks Blake,” Rubys voice sounded grateful. “Can you and Yang take watch tonight? I think I need to, um…”

“No problem Ruby,” Blake patted Ruby on the shoulder and headed towards another cavern containing Yang and Oscar. 

Ruby guided her deeper into the cavern, lighting her scroll to let them see. It was a poor light, but it was enough. 

Weiss looked at Ruby, the woman tapping her fingers together. 

“Ruby, what happened?”

The tapping intensified. 

“Weiss, I’m so sorry,” Ruby burst out. “I didn’t mean, I didn’t expect, I mean when I picked up Nora there was never, I mean, I didn’t mean to read you like that!”

Weiss blinked. “Read me? You mean, you felt my emotions too?”

Ruby nodded. “I don’t really know how it works…I’ve only ever picked up Nora before. But when I touched her when we were attacking together, I felt…something. I don’t know, it was like there was a barrier there, stopping me. But when you touched me, I could feel what you were feeling, I could feel how scared you were. I’m so sorry Weiss, I didn’t mean you do that or make you so scared.”

Ruby buried her face in her arms and turned away, leaning against the wall of the cavern. Weiss could hear sobbing and in the dim light saw Rubys shoulder shaking. 

Weiss walked forward, wrapping her arms around Rubys waist and leaning her head on her girlfriends’ shoulder. 

“You dolt, there’s nothing to be sorry for,” she whispered into Ruby’s ear. “I was scared, but I was just surprised. Nobody expects to be able to feel someone else’s emotions, especially in the middle of a battle. It’s just taken me a while to work out what happened.”

Ruby turned around in her arms, looking into her eyes.

“Really?” she asked. 

“Really,” Weiss smiled. She reached up, stroking the side of Rubys head. “Tell you what…if you wanted…could you do it again?”

“I, um, I don’t know,” Ruby tilted her head slightly. “I’ve never tried this intentionally before, I don’t even know why it happens.”

“Do you want to?” Weiss asked.

“Yeah, OK,” Ruby said. Backing away from Weiss a step, Ruby closed her eyes. Weiss followed suit, focusing on the grip Ruby maintained on her arm. There was a rush of air and Weiss’s eyes snapped open.  Time seemed to stand still. Ruby stood shock still in front of her, a hand firmly gripping her arm. 

“Ruby?” Weiss asked. 

There was no response. The woman remained still, almost eerily so in the semi-darkness. 

Weiss looked around and summoned a few glyphs on the walls. There were no enemies around to stumble into them, but they provided a good amount of light to illuminate the small cavern. 

“Ruby?” Weiss called again. She could see her girlfriend clearly now and could see the hair on Ruby’s head holding itself in place in mid-air where it should have fallen to rest against her face. 

Weiss lifted another strand and marvelled as it held itself in the air. Looking closely, she could see the strand of hair falling ever so slowly downwards. 

“She’s not actually stopping time,” Weiss thought out loud. “She’s just making me move so quickly it seems like everything else as stopped.” She stroked Ruby’s cheek where her hair had covered it and a spasm of shock ran though her. 

She pulled her hand away from Ruby’s face as if she had been electrocuted. She had felt them again! Ruby’s emotions, pouring though into her hand and as if they had become her own. 

Wiess steadied herself. She reached forward once more, placing her palm against Ruby’s face. 

Worry. Concern. Anxiety. Lust, hiding at the back, waiting. Love. So much love. She felt it all, but not why. 

She pulled away, and gently released the grip that Ruby had on her arm. 

Ruby blinked and stared for a moment at the glyphs on the walls. 

“How long?” Ruby asked. 

“A couple of minutes,” Weiss replied. She smiled a little apologetically. “I had to get used to it again.”

“That’s okay,” said Ruby, rubbing her cheek. “I didn’t feel anything though.”

“No,” said Weiss. “I didn’t think you would. You were completely still, not like on the train. It was like you had transferred your semblance to me while you were holding my arm, but once I broke the connection everything went back to normal.”

“Oh,” Ruby thought for a moment. “But…you felt my emotions again…right?”

Weiss nodded. “It was amazing. But it felt like, I don’t know how to describe it. Like I could feel everything you felt, clearer then before, but I couldn’t tell why. It was confusing, it was like as if they had become my emotions, but I didn’t know why I was feeling them.”

Ruby bit her lip. 

“It’s okay!” Weiss tried to reassure her. “We can’t just try again, right? With both of us this time?”

“It won’t work,” Ruby mumbled, staring at the floor and shuffling her feet. “I’m…it won’t work.” 
Weiss blinked. “Why not?”

“I’m…I’m holding back too much.”

“What do you mean?”

Ruby started pacing up and down in the bright light of the glyphs. “We got together, and it was great, but then Beacon fell, and you left, I mean you came back! But I didn’t know, I wasn’t sure, maybe you didn’t still want to be together or still feel the same way about me? I didn’t want to push you, so I held back, I didn’t kiss you or try and be around you as much in case you wanted space I didn’t know if…”

“Ruby,” Weiss grabbed the woman’s shoulders and faced her. “If you want to know how I feel, just go ahead.”

“W-what?”

“Do the opposite of what you did for me a minute ago. Activate your semblance, keep it with you. I will be the one standing still. Feel my emotions.”

Ruby stared for a moment, and then nodded. She steadied herself, her grip firm on Weiss’s arm. 

“Are you sure?”

Weiss groaned. “Get on with it, dolt!”

She saw the corner of Ruby’s mouth twitch and then there was a flash of light. Ruby had moved. She had backed away from Weiss, her face a mess of tears. 

“Ruby!” Weiss called, hurrying forward. Ruby collapsed into her arms, sobbing into her clothes. 

“What is it?” Wiess asked, stroking her hair. *‘What she felt...I couldn’t be that bad, surely?’*

“I...I...,” Ruby stuttered, before drawing breath. 

“I love you.”

Weiss tightened her grip on Ruby’s back. 

“I know. I love you too.”

Weiss wasn’t sure how, but somehow, they had ended up on the floor, arms still around each other, lips locked in a firm embrace. She didn’t need Ruby’s semblance to understand the other woman’s emotions now, as Ruby pushed her to the ground and straddled her waist, still learning forward and kissing her. 

She thought she knew what Ruby wanted, but still, she had to ask. 

“Ruby, are you sure?”

Silver eyes met ice blue. 

“If you are.”

Weiss kissed her again.

"As stated in other comments, the game developers clearly wanted to play off human psychology. They made it addictive, they have the reward triggers set just far enough apart so that you feel like your not wasting time. They made activities reset daily so that if you don't play you feel like you're falling behind weather it's the community or your friends  (no one wants to be the lowest level in your friends right?)

So it might not be a overnight change and you don't want to come off as passive aggressive but as far as I can tell he hasn't realized that hes being played. Getting him to realize this instead of you telling him may help.

Once I finally took a long break from destiny did I realize how absurd it was. My sleep schedule sucked, I was tired at work all the time, I stopped playing guitar or any other hobbies as much, and I didn't really do anything else. If I wasn't playing I was reading about it on here or watching videos on the newest secret. All for what my character has. 

That's the trap of destiny. Idk how to help but that is how it sucks you in. I was trying to think of a subtle way to allow him to see what he has become (watch strange addiction with your time together?) Maybe a vacation where he can't bring his game system? I really do wish you luck and hope that this subreddit has given you some insight or ideas.

"I think there may be some confusion here. California offers free prenatal screenings, but these blood tests measure levels of proteins and small molecules: PAPP-A, hCG, AFP, uE3, and Inhibin. The levels of those proteins and small molecules tend to differ between normal and trisomic pregnancies, due to metabolic changes caused by the disorders.

NIPT measures something different: DNA fragments that are present in the bloodstream after having been expelled from dead cells. If the fetus has e.g. trisomy 18, there will be more DNA fragments from chromosome 18 in the blood than expected. NIPT is a more direct test of the fetus's genomic status, and more accurate.

"A strange intersection of my job (math professor) and hobbies (anime) was recommended to me by Chrome today. As told in this article, someone on /sci/ was interested in the following question:

Assume you want to have seen Haruhi S1 (14 episodes) in every possible order. How many episodes total do you have to watch?

For example, if there were only three episodes, you would want to have seen all six orderings:

123

132

213

231

312

321

But you can do better than simply watching all six orderings in a row. For example, watching 123 followed by 132 means you will also have seen 231 on the way (the 23 from the first set, immediately followed by the 1 from the second set). As told by Robin Houston, how to do this in the fewest possible total episodes is actually an open problem if there are 6 different episodes or more.

While the 4chan post did not solve the problem exactly, it apparently did provide a valid proof of a bound that has gotten mathematicians one step closer to the answer."

You're making the claim that milk is unhealthy.  The burden of proof is on you to start sharing evidence.  I simply started by making the claim that drinking a lot of milk helps one gain weight.

&gt;Exactly. Please show me how to ""moderate"" the amount of cancer growth. Or how to tell my body to only grow lean muscle mass, but not tumors cells. You are even admitting that increasing IGF-1 levels is positively correlated with cancer growth, but you still recommend OP to drink a lot of whole milk, which will raise his IGF-1 levels.

Correlation is not causation.  Also, I never said that drinking a lot of milk needs to become a lifestyle change.  It's a temporary solution to gain weight.  After sufficient weight is gained the amount of milk consumption can be moderated.

&gt;Not an argument.

Never said it was, but glad to see you aren't denying it.

&gt;You can build just as much muscle mass as a vegan. There are numerous people out there proofing you wrong every day. There are also a range of vegan protein powders available which digest better and work just as well. Without all the downsides of dairy. Not an argument.

"&gt;Well if ""no precedent"" is what you're worried about then you're not approaching ""imaginary time signatures"" in the right spirit. (Or you're dispositionally not the right audience for it.)

In a sense, that may be so, but I'd say the ""right audience"" is someone who even agrees that this is possible to represent within the framework of what we already know about time signatures (which is what I mean about ""precedent"" - not generally that it hasn't been done before).  In other words, the right audience, I think, will have to believe that you can decide each piece of a time signature can mean whatever you want, and I just don't believe that, nor do I think it's reasonable to believe that.  

I understand the distinction between thinking in terms of the whole song and thinking in measures and, in isolation, I *do* agree with his conclusion there - that time signatures apply to the measure, not the song.  But this is where the impossibility of the endeavor creeps in, because we can't have two different timeframes that have different actual durations simultaneously without either 1. having the gap or  2. having the total duration of *all the measures* being different from one another, as you'd have in a polytemporal piece.  The presence of the gap is direct evidence that this solution is shoddy, because the gap is produced by this alignment of two alien numerical systems and *not by either system in itself*.  Meaning the imaginary number calculations don't themselves produce a space.  It isn't until you place them next to what, in a sense, *should* be there that you have a gap, which is what I'm calling ""arbitrary"" (for lack of better word - it's not arbitrary in the sense that it isn't determined by *anything* but, it isn't a direct product of imaginary numbers, and it wouldn't be there unless we were deciding that we're going to force one dimension into another).  What you say about time ""resetting"" is crucial here:  even in a piece with constantly changing real number time signatures, there is not ""resetting"" of time.  Time flows on, we just change the units (or, usually, the *amount* of those units) that we are using to represent that time.  Here, we're agreeing (or not agreeing, as it were) that different time lines can start or stop depending on convenience.  

The thing is I don't really have a solution for these issues because of how fundamentally I disagree with the very premise of representing time in this way.  Even non-dyadic time signatures actually make sense mathematically and are consistent with everything else we knew and understood about how we measure relative note values.  That system is just not hospitable to dealing with multiple dimensions at once, and our perception of time is not hospitable to that either.  I did, for the record, admit that I gave him points for creativity, but I just can't say that this works.   "

"There are a zillion ways to do backups in Linux. I prefer simple things that I can understand.

If you happen to have an external hard drive of equal size or greater than your hard drive, I can recommend using `dd`. 

`dd` very simply does a direct bit to bit copy of two items. In this case, you'd be doing a bit to bit copy from your computer's hard drive to the back up hard drive. 

`dd` cannot accomodate the source file changing while the data is being copied. To make sure your computer hard drive does not change during the copy, you should fully shut down, boot up a USB live-disk session, and use `dd` from the live disk session. 

I just read over [this tutorial](https://www.linux.com/learn/full-metal-backup-using-dd-command) and it looks factually correct to me. "

"No, in order to gain weight you need to do something that your body decides requires you to gain weight. Eating a lot of food isn't going to be that unless your body somehow thinks it needs to store energy for a coming fast. I'm not low on insulin, I've had my blood tested for unrelated reasons and it's always been fine. When I eat a lot, I shit a lot. That's a very simple concept and it very easily explains why I don't gain weight. Of course people who don't understand physics (the body isn't a closed system, laws of thermodynamics apply to closed systems, trying to apply it to nutrition and weight gain simply shows you don't understand it on the most basic level) or biology (food goes in your mouth, waste comes out your ass), but think they do, keep looking for other off the wall explanations. 
 
The key to weight gain for people who don't put on weight easily is not eating more, it's engaging in activity that stimulates muscle growth, and then you're only going to grow the absolute minimum necessary based on the demands you put on your body that it couldn't meet (if it did anything more than the minimum necessary, it wouldn't be working properly). The extent that eating comes in there is you should be eating good quality food that your body can make use of, and enough, but simply trying to go for a calorie surplus is stupid. I eat a lot because I enjoy eating, but I'm under no illusion that I'm going to gain any weight at a faster rate because of it. I'm gaining at a rate of a few kilos per decade, I can speed it up a bit with heavy lifting, but if I stop, gains disappear, even if I continue eating the same amount. "

I mainly play solo in hard point or s&amp;d. I run into 5 mans or 4s frequently and some are trash and some are not. A big factor is your teammates and the enemy. However my advice to you is, it really helps if you say on the outside of the map and not go to the middle. Knowing spawns also helps a lot which is why I don’t play every game mode bc the more you play one game mode on a map you know the spawns even if they are fucked up sometimes. Adding on to that, game knowledge is key. How to challenge more than one person at a time. How to peak corners and ect. Kill streaks are a saving grace to carrying games, choppers and uavs are the best to run bc they help out your team and kill the enemy team. Counter uav is also help full for you and your team.  Also just keep playing the game, the more you put in the better and more consistent you get. Some people start out bad and end up doing a lot better a month down the road bc they put hours into the game.

This was mostly for respawn game modes. S&amp;D is a totally different monster to be consistent in.

Hopefully this helps you. :)"

"Having entered a variety of such competitions in the past, I'd like to ask how much artwork will figure into the competition. Can you actually win this competition with no art? 

It has been my experience that art is always --conspicuously-- left out of initial solicitations but, in the end, becomes the primary factor in such competitions because, in truth, they are often about seeking artwork. If a book is planned, most-certainly, there is an expectation of a significant amount of visuals coming with these submissions. It's primarily what sells a non-fiction book now. And $17,500 is actually pretty cheap for getting a space book illustrated, let alone being able to recycle that artwork in many other media.

Having been a president of a space advocacy group myself, I know just how hard producing space media is today. Most books end-up recycling the same 20-50 year old NASA content over and over. Futurism has a big problem with media because the impact of text is now very poor and declining, the skillbase of commercial illustration of the heyday of space, science, and futurist books no longer exists, commission art is extremely inefficient and costly, and no publishers pay for art today. This was probably the single-biggest obstacle I faced as a group president. Student competitions were often suggested to me as a way to get art cheap. But having personally been on the other side of this, spending weeks or months on competition entries that ultimately had no real chance for lack of art not even mentioned as a requirement up-front, I refused to use competitions myself. I trust you can thus understand where I'm coming from with this question.

and slashed .337/.477/.624 (189 OPS+) over that span (461 PAs).

Had an average WAR of 7.2 per season (9.0 WAR per 650 PAs) from age 20-34,

and slashed .348/.484/.638 (191 OPS+) over that span (546 PAs).

&amp;#x200B;

Willie Mays 1967 - 22 HRs, 4.4 WAR.

Had an average WAR of 6.5 per season (8.0 WAR per 650 PAs) from age 34-40,

and slashed .287/.379/.516 (150 OPS+) over that span (564 PAs).

Had an average WAR of 8.4 per season (9.4 WAR per 650 PAs) from age 20-33,

and slashed .313/.388/.589 (161 OPS+) over that span (616 PAs).

&amp;#x200B;

Hank Aaron 1972 - 34 HRs, 3.9 WAR.

Had an average WAR of 3.9 per season (5.5 WAR per 650 PAs) from age 35-42,

and slashed .282/.376/.539 (150 OPS+) over that span (507 PAs)

and slashed .314/.373/.560 (157 OPS+) over that span (659 PAs)

&amp;#x200B;

Notice that each player was appreciably worse over the stretch that you provided when compared with the entirety of their career before that stretch.

I am not disagreeing with the claim that these guys were not ordinary and that they processed incredible talent. However, I disagree with the claim that they had the ability to adjust to a league where the competition had become much greater. To me, it looks like they were talented players who produced gaudy numbers in their later years due to a talent level that is still far above the average in what, by today's standards, would be considered an inferior league with a higher variation in talent.

I am not downplaying the older players in an effort to prop up the modern players, I am showing that 1) the metrics that we have can't separate the talent of a particular player from the overall talent of the player pool at that player's time; 2) these metrics exhibit a favorable bias in favor of older players, relative to modern players, as a result of higher variability of talent that existed in earlier eras. Again, the Gould video was very clear on why the first point is so and is even clearer on the second point.

All of this still doesn't address my other question:

Look at career leaders in WAR and wrc+ from fangraphs for the years 1871-2018. Considering how much the source population has changed, do you really believe that 13 of the top 25 players all time and 7 of the top 10 started their careers before baseball was integrated in 1947? (both metrics tabulated the same number of old-timers in their top 10 and top 25)"

Since none of this is consensual it scares me that you’re putting up with it. Please end it. You will find someone that actually cares about you one day I promise! You may be even feeling more guilt than love. I left someone that didn’t care about me as much as I cared about him and found someone I couldn’t imagine living the rest my life without. The hardest part is leaving. Since he is abusive it wouldn’t even be wrong if you ghosted him honestly. Get a restraining order if he harasses you. I’m serious...

"Ok so I gotta say. When you say “the nuts with the guns will defend this theft” you might be right.

But.

You’re ignoring the fact that the very reason many of those “nuts” have guns in the first place is to protect against a tyrannical government like one you’re describing.

So if you’re really honestly scared of a government that has fixed elections to such an extent that they can never lose...then what recourse do you have?

I’m not at all advocating for violence, just pointing out that some on the left don’t seem to not acknowledge the fact that the 2nd amendment isn’t just for right wing “nut jobs.”"

As someone that travels way too much for work I wish all airlines would do away with carry on luggage bigger than a backpack, purse or briefcases. It wastes so much time loading and unloading the plane with people struggling to get their bags even onto the plane, let alone the overhead bins.

"Is this storage purely for backup purposes?

Yes, we use the big vendors storage, the kind that goes up to 1.4PB usable.

What is your typical refresh cycle for gear?  3 years?

We typically run a 5 depreciation cycle.

What is your monthly storage delta from the previous month? 

I’d be hard pressed to say I have a 164 backup domains to look at.  

Do you have historical data from previous months you can extrapolate on?
I have data however it was recently discovered that the data is no good the tool collecting it multiplied the differentials by 2 - 6x.

Any new or ending projects that would affect storage growth?
We constantly add clients, and clients go live our average weekly growth client wise is 100-200 per week

How long do you need to keep backups?
Backup retention is determined by government regulations for the most part, so it could be 30 or forever."

"Well I can agree with you that if Iran's economy was performing better the people would probably have better living conditions, materially speaking. What I don't really agree with is the idea that the current government will radically change their civil rights laws. Iran being a fully independent country again is the goal. However I worry that should affairs continue the way they are, Iran would eventually become very destitute and perhaps even brainwashed over a few generations. Yes I think they can think for themselves and they aren't children but they need access to resources and information, which the government can censor. Although the same argument could be made then, should the US back off, those reactionaries can again say ""wow look how great things are without US intervention"" and use that to continue their agenda. Of course part of me wants all the mullahs out of the country completely, but that's just a personal token wish of mine.

In follow up to that last edit, no I have not visited. I know they all have VPNs and access to information now, I call my family there every so often, but I think if things get worse the country will begin to censor more and they do know how to do it.

spend death breath's and material on yellow weapon/ring/necklace to legendary via cube and spend bloodshards on armour (25 per piece) or rings (50 per piece).

white gear is better to salvage, use 1 db and 1 yellow gear in cube to convert 100 white material to 100 yellow material. white gear to mat is 1:7 whereas yellow is 1:1. you find them on armor/weapon racks in maps like battlefields of eternity (act 5) and act 1 dungeons. "

And, say, Bloodborne 2 + Horizon Zero Dawn 2 as release titles would force me to spend 4k BRL on the new Bloodborne 2 machine with no regrets. There's also speculation that Déraciné is related to Bloodborne, but... this is not the place to go wild. lol

Still, there's the July 2016 Gamespot interview that said Miyazaki had no plans for Bloodborne 2. I have my issues with that interview because part of it looks translated, but we must also take it seriously.

"What you've noticed, is what you want to notice; that the complaints are not valid because the group making them is inherently and irrationally biased. The fact that you're still continuing to tunnel on the people instead of the merits of their complaints is evidence of that

There's plenty to suggest the game is not nearly as perfect as you think. And while it's true the reception to Origins is warm, you're missing the context here which presented itself in many comments and reviews of the game; that the games are a departure from the past and the very mere fact that it was a departure was enough to award the game praise. It's not at all an uncommon thread if you read the pieces on Origins. Similarly, reading the reviews of Odyssey presents many similar threads of flaws too, they tell more of a story than the number or stars or the sales figure that people tunnel on.

"I don’t think it sounds formal at all, and, as I noted elsewhere, I would use signore in more polite contexts. Because I agree, it sounds relatively rough. The point is, I can’t imagine any context where I would say, “ma quando arrivano le donne?” I would say ragazze or, at a push, femmine with friends and family, and signore in other contexts. Donna always sounds quite negative to me, shorthand for the worker-woman whose name you can’t be bothered to remember, or, as I’ve noted elsewhere, ‘Donna, schiava...’. On the flip side, it can also sound archaic and formal to me,  reminiscent of ‘Madonna dir vo voglio’ type stuff. I’m not encouraging people to go out and say, ehi, femmina, to a bunch of ladies, just arguing that it’s unfair to say it doesn’t hold a valid role as a noun meaning ‘woman’ in neo-standard Italian. 

Edit: In much the same way I’d very rarely find myself saying the word ‘woman’ in English. It normally sounds unnecessarily harsh or rude. I might ask someone, when are the girls getting here?, even if the girls are my 90-year-old aunts, or, when will the ladies be arriving?, in a more formal setting. ‘Women’ just makes me think of John Belushi in the restaurant scene in Blues Brothers: “The women, how much for the women?”"

Airflow is along the X axis on that chart, not the Y. So things further to the right (not up) indicate higher airflow. The way that is layed out better performance is down and to the right.

She had insisted on sleeping together, not that Weiss had objected, and thus Weiss found herself with Ruby’s head pressed against her shoulder, her breasts fitting neatly under Weiss’s own and their legs intertwined. Weiss thought that, all in all, they fit together rather well. 

She idly played with Ruby’s hair and smiled as a small sigh came from the younger woman. She closed her eyes, picturing the scene in her minds eye and capturing every detail. Weiss wanted this moment to last forever. 

For she didn’t need Ruby’s semblance to stop time. 

All she needed was Ruby.

"&gt;2017 was the second year in a row in which black nationalists committed murders in the US.

First question you should ask, is this a coincidence?

If yes, then your projected model likely holds. If not, then your projection likely does not hold.
This study did not do any projections, that was not part of their analysis. There was no mathematical analysis done.

&gt;You ignored the findings of a comprehensive study and made a non-sensical argument with zero data to back it up.

This tends to be the response of people who are unable to handle math, or comprehend fundamental scientific or logical principles. The other day someone commented that 3 million people died a YEAR from failed abortions pre-roe v. wade. To put in perspective 3 million a year is literally higher than the TOTAL DEATHS you get from calculating with the mortality rate. However because there was not some random link that spelled out their mathematically obvious bullshit, was well bullshit, they refused to believe that it was impossible for that number to be true. Even though it would literally require people to be resurrected by car crashes to make sense.

You have responded in a similar way, and appear to have a comparable understanding of mathematics, and I guess science for that matter.

&gt;zero data to back it up

No. I used the data from the link you provided. Your study is NOT, I repeat NOT, in contradiction with what I am saying. Please understand this!

IF, I repeat, IF you use data from 1995 till now, the results they get are accurate. HOWEVER, to use that to project and say 'Right wing terrorists are a greater threat NOW' IS NOT something they did in the study. It is not a valid argument and assumes, like I said nothing changes. WHICH IT CLEARLY DID.

You have a about what? 10/20 left wing terror deaths per year from 1995-2015. From 2016-2017 you have 13 left wing terror deaths, so a rate of 13/1.5 given the time it was written. That is approximately 17 x increase in the rate of left wing terror deaths. Which is higher than the death rate for right wing terror deaths given the same time span only 5 deaths happened from 2016-2017 gap.

It is unlikely that such an event would happen randomly, especially when all the evidence we have currently, points otherwise. Occam's Razor buddy.

But lets be clear, You will fail to understand this simple logic, and are likely incapable of arguing against it. Thus you will claim 'it is nonsensical' when it reality, it is purely a FAILURE of you to be able to comprehend the most elementary principles of mathematics and probability. 

Look, I get it, math is hard, but you don't need to try and save face with such nonsense.

"i'm pretty neutral and bipartisan, but i have to say its getting more and more obvious /r/politics has become completely left wing and is getting/buying upvotes to get to the top of the front page. 11781 upvotes with 90% upvoted is completely unheard of. about 5 years ago /r/politics was rarely top of the frontpage and back then upvotes were a more standard 50-60% upvoted. 

there's clear manipulation going on and i don't have time to find historical proof but i do know in the past redditors have uncovered proof of upvote tampering favoring left wing/democrats.

again i have no political agenda, i'm pretty neutral and moderate i guess. but this thread is by far the most pure evidence of frontpage tampering. 

There is no way the opinions of reddit are this collective when reddit is a global website. No way in 3 hours can it go up to the top of the front page with 90% upvoting."

"Unfortunately the problem persists. I was able to transfer all my files to the laptop hard drive and relink successfully (if I select ""open file location"" for any given clip, it takes me to the computer hd folder where they are stored).

I was working on the project a bit last night, saved, and put the computer to sleep without closing Resolve. When I restarted, Resolve was not responding and greyed out/ crashed. 

When I reopened Resolve, the project autoloaded and had the same Media Offline problem, with a good portion of the latter half of clips giving the red error message both in the bin and timeline. I tried relinking, but the affected clips were unchanged and still gave the error.

I reverted to clicking home and reloading the project's most recent backup and again the clips appeared as normal with no errors. Any other ideas? This appears to be my only workaround so far. Thanks again."

"This justifies mistreatment of a user based on unfounded claims and asserts I can go prove your claim for you.

Whether you're right or wrong, this is your admission that you can't, or won't, provide evidence to support your claims and I shouldn't give your remarks weight beyond, ""Someone on the internet claimed X."" Which is to say, next to none.

It's odd though, given that you said it was important to warn people about his dishonesty, that you don't actually care if I believe you. Almost like it's about making the claim instead of the ostensible warning of others. 'Cause that could tie back into harassment."

Are you single? 
And tasty with milk. 
"I see it totally opposite from you. Your knowledge, your work ethic, your skillset, those are things you can *achieve*, and be proud of, and are and should be worthy of compliments.

Your looks, on the other hand, with the exception of a few cosmetic choices (make up, hair style/color, clothing), are entirely out of control, and you didn't do a single thing to earn them, so compliments of your looks *should* fall flat. 

Of course, they don't, since we live in a society that values women mostly for their looks, which is how they so often get de-humanized, and this is one of the biggest problems with our society. Looks also have the tendency to fade as one ages, even further instilling the idea that they don't mean anything at all. Should a woman be considered less of a person because she's not as good looking as she once was? Of course not, and yet this occurs SO commonly it's noteworthy if it doesn't happen.  


When a woman tells you she wants to be complemented for what they do, not how they look, LISTEN TO THEM. It's because they too understand that only being valued for your looks leads to all of the awful shit that happens to women. People are SO MUCH MORE than what they look like, men and women alike. It's not right to think of someone as a tool, either, as that's similarly dehumanizing, but someones talents, abilities, knowledge, skills, and achievements are all things that we all want to be appreciated for/complimented on."

"Don't get me started on the LN. It's not even close to a real solution. The whole point of Bitcoin isn't that the human race has never seen fungible currency before -- it's that there is a legitimate worldwide problem of these bankers ruling over everything through the money system. That the ability to create money out of thin air and then loan it out at interest makes them the endless rulers of us all -- and that's not good. 

In that light, a centralized solution such as a LN is not a solution at all. It's like trying to get out of the rain by stepping into a running shower. The only reason more people don't dismiss LN for the nonsense it is, is because the majority of what is going on in the world is hidden from their comprehension. 

They don';t really understand how the current financial system works, or who is in charge, or how Bitcoin works, or the allegiances of the people pushing LN, etc etc. 

BCH is the only coin worth paying attention to right now. And that should give you a good clue as to how fucked up crypto is right now. It's not that BCH is bad...it's more that bankers et al have been so successful at propagandizing the shit out of what Bitcoin is and controlling the conversation and the direction of investment and development. 

It isn't too difficult when you control the money supply to lead the sheep. You can create massive booms and busts by sloshing money around in the crypto markets, by controlling what and when major media outlets talk about Bitcoin, by buying off and manipulating established influencers in the community.  There's not a lot of people who really 'get' Bitcoin, but there's almost nobody who doesn't want to see 10000% profits a year on their investments. Greed, a human vulnerability since time immemorial, can be used to string people along until they lose their shirts and turn away from the solution that is right in their face. 

Everyone wants a better world. But you can't fix a problem you don't understand. Most people don't understand the problems. But there are many people out there who can manipulate them into supporting solutions that are not really solutions, turning them from good natured people into useful idiots. And centralization of power is a big problem with that...you can do it en mass. "

This allows you to have multiple switches connect back to a centralized point and if any one switch port fails, there’s another port to fall back on.   This is called STP re-convergence, which takes about 15-20 seconds. 

Also, with your topology, you’re not looking anyways (you don’t believe in redundancy), so you want to use vlans. But whatever, you keep asking Reddit for answers, we keep telling you, and you keep ignoring.  Wake up and realize someone else might know something you don’t. "

"I don’t think so. If he evicted KC, she’d go into roundtable campaigning against him since loyalty was huge for her and that’d be a giant betrayal. She’s openly said she wouldn’t vote for him if he evicted her, so I feel safe saying she’d campaign against him considering she was also super close with angela and JC. The whole jury respected KC and would take anything she said seriously. the jury would then feel confirmed in their belief that angela is controlling poor wounded bird Tyler and also think he’s a total asshole for evicting his best friend for a girl he’s into (not knowing they’re literally in love). In that case, I could easily see angela getting kc, Haleigh, Scottie, and potentially Brett, bayleigh and/ or fess.  
I also think he could lose to JC in that scenario for the same reasoning. 
The best thing that could have happened was angela won f4 veto and evicted KC (could be a 9-0 win imo) or Brett won double eviction veto and took down JC and Tyler had to put up KC thinking she’d stay, but was blindsided after she gets evicted "

"Yes and it wasn't good. We weren't close per say. 

A coworker and I use to be friendly with each other. At first people thought we were related because we look like we could be brother and sister.

Then a rumor started over a conversation that someone overheard that the two of us were sleeping together. We were talking about our spouses...

Some time after that rumor died down we weren't friendly with each other anymore (I called him out for slacking off too much and he didn't like it). Then he started talking crap and somehow that morphed into drama that had nothing to do with me.

John - Underdog/wildcard, the one most people didn't expect to win    
James - Wildcard, although his experiments usually resulted in positive feedback so leaning toward pro  
Brendan - Pro, consistently strong (and retro) all season

Series 4:  
Frances - Underdog, although she started strong she had her ""style over substance"" arc  
Ruby - Wildcard, the narration of the final even says so!  
Kimberley - Pro, consistently strong all season

Series 5:  
Nancy - Pro  
Richard - Pro  
Luis - Pro  
One of the best casts for the competition as a whole. All three bakers were consistently good the entire competition, save for one or two off bakes. Richard had the most negatives, but he also had the most star bakers ever, so he definitely doesn't fit the ""underdog"" description. 

Series 6:  
Nadiya - Underdog, started out consistently getting last in technicals until the back third of the show when she consistently got first and became a force of nature  
Ian - Pro, favorite of Paul and Mary from the second episode  
Tamal - Pro, perhaps a little underdog in terms of the final episode?  

What do you guys think?

"I know you really tried Neuro but this is exactly what I feared.

All the changes are focused towards support Karma. I was genuinely  hoping some spells would actually be altered to do something new for Mid  karma as it is extremely boring to have only one proper nuke spell with  hard target accessibility. Having her Q like Brand W would make  focusing so much more practical. The reason she actually is played as a  support is because she has been a shield bot since u stripped her  identity away over time (mainly looking at u shield bomb). Other mages  do what she does 100x better, that is why.

As for her ""identity"", we all wanted her to be the spiritual leader  of Ionia and that to be portrayed in her abilities. Sadly, this change  that was promised **2 months** ago did not fulfill this  identity whatsoever in my personal opinion.  There was this idea of  Karma doing something out of her main body channeled, what happened to  unique ideas like those?

Why cant they just give us our shield bomb back, this would have give  her that extra UMPH and give her a real identity as if aiding her  people in need and being a force to be reckoned with. Sorry but giving  CD and mana makes her feel like old Soraka battery charge mode  completely dependent on your team. Time management probably the issue  here, again sadly.

If I am completely honest this felt like receiving the christmas gift from last year wrapped in some fancy words.

For the people that mainly support I truly hope you are satisfied  with these changes as I have given up on this champion. This may seem  like a  negative post but i needed to portray my true feelings towards  these changes as I have waited a long time to witness them and hope some  other changes for mid karma may come later on."

"It still burns, in a process called pyrolysis ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis) ) which is: ""  the [thermal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal) [decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition) of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere"". Basically it burns without oxygen. You can provide an initial heat source to get it going but it becomes self sustaining I believe and provides considerably more heat than required to get it started. So in this context, maybe use the solar to heat it and get it started and then use the heat from the pyrolysis process to provide the energy to run the cooling unit to extract the water. "

"Difference is that surrey has approximately 4X more officers than Richmond which will substantially increase the cost.

Switching from rcmp is not going to fix surrey gang crime, Abbotsford is a good example of that.

Further banning weed sales in surrey actually encourages these dial a dope gangs to continue operating in surrey.

I am not saying Surrey shouldn't replace rcmp I am just saying that I don't see any evidence it will help crime. 

A previous news report several months ago estimated the change over cost in surrey to its own police force would be 80-100 million, due to the size difference."

Don't think of it as lowering the standard as much as adding room at the top. Often in a 100% system you're not necessarily even testing for advanced very well, if a strong proficient student (which to me is what an A should mean) will get 95%+."

Knowing when to use your cooldowns so that you can run the dungeon as fast as possible is a huge part of being a \*good\* tank in dungeons.

"Yeah, as others have already said, unfortunately I don't think any amount of label use consistency can override these issues. Society just seems to have certain ideas about sexuality - and one of these is that all women are basically bisexual on some level - whatever they say, however they identify and whatever they call themselves. Or even if people don't truly believe that, they don't care - it's more about what they want from you in the moment than about respecting your boundaries (and identity).

It's similar to the idea that all men who are into men at all are secretly fully gay. Society can't seem to accept that truly bisexual men actually exist.

At any rate, I think it's more of a social and cultural phenomenon, not something that consistent label use will ""fix"", unfortunately."

It might have unintended consequences, but as a general rule, you can use the console to progress through quest stages.  Just look the quest up on the wiki and find the numbers for the quest stages, then use the ""setstage"" command to advance through them (you generally want to go through each of the stages one at a time rather than just jumping to the last one you want, since it'll potentially break the quest if it advances to a later stage without passing through the earlier ones).  And you can close any Oblivion gate by opening the console, clicking on the gate and typing ""CloseOblivionGate""."

"I'd rather use liquid for cooling as aquatuners are more energy efficient. Gases that cold will need better insulation, and normal material insulated pipes are not going to do the job. Also, if you are really serious about efficiency not just making something that works, you should try to incorporate a steam turbine in the condensing stage.

For the guide part, I would suggest you search this subreddit and also the klei forum. I came across something a while ago using merely aquatuners for heat transfer, but that could easily be adapted to volcanic designs. There is also a design on klei forum using volcanoes, but that's before space industry, so it is massive and overly complicated. You may need to dig in and come up with your own."

"Hello and I am so happy to hear this. 

The advice for you that I am getting from the Tarot Card and divination is to relax. But you already knew that :P You just need a little more guidance on how and what specifically to do.

In your cards you already have all the keys to get pregnant but your anxiety and nerves are causing a stress reaction which makes it difficult.

Take a moment out of your day everyday to meditate on your blessings, Thank the universe and your guides for everything they have blessed you with and remain grateful no matter how hard things get. 

This time you need to spend with yourself more than ever to start re-balancing your life. Re-balance yourself spiritually, emotionally and physically. Think back to what made you the happiest or what hobbies that relieved stress and take those back up.

You can even use this as a preparation time to think of all the fun activities you will be planning to do with your son or daughter in the future. All the happy moments in your life you want to share with them. Remember to keep thinking positive and affirm the things you WILL do when you DEFINITELY DO have your baby.

As humans on this earth we tend to let negative thoughts crowd out the positive and run our lives. You will definitely have a little one and it will come when you least expect it, so until that time comes continue to meditate - count your blessings - relax - and regain your happiness both with your partner and with yourself."

Admittedly I haven’t been on reddit for much longer than 2 years, so I’m not sure on all the details of what those subs were like at some point, but them being bad isn’t really related to the incel ban. I have seen people claim that cringeanarchy was pretty moderate when it was first created (some drama with r/cringe, I think?), but I’ve also seen people claim that cringeanarchy only got bad in the past year or so, which I know is objectively false, so that makes me doubt that cringeanarchy was ever a great place."

To be fair, there are what seem to be a lot of pictures of gay men on your website. One in particular is of two men seemingly about to kiss. Again, most if not all male models definately look gay. 

I have nothing against that at all. Im bi myself. That said, i see why some women would see your brand as being marketed towards gay men. And quite frankly, i believe that is the case as well.

Does that mean straight men cannot wear this brand? No. Does that mean this brand is a ""gay"" brand? No. I would assume though, that a good percentage of your customers are gay/bi. Maybe even the majority."

"You're allowed your skepticism.  Yet the goal of rhetoric is to convince one's audience.  It is not to convince one's audience through the use of truth, or to convince one's audience through the use of falsehood.  It is simply to convince one's audience.  Whatever tools are borne in that effort, they are in support of that goal of convincing the audience, and all tools are permitted.  Rhetoric itself is, in the end, morally neutral.

"Hi Cuebe, 

Sorry for  the delay in getting back to you, I was traveling.

Our algorithm tracks prices based on what other users have told us they think a game is worth. The algorithm is our *secret sauce* so I can't tell you exactly how it works, but I can tell you that if the countered price is $7.59, someone, somewhere, has indicated to us that is the amount they would pay for Bedlam. That seems high to me too, but the awesome thing about our system is the more people like you give us their input, the better our system and algorithm will become. 

While we *can't always* guarantee you the lowest price, after all we are still competing with big name folks who have a lot more negotiating power than us, we *can* always guarantee you a fair price. 

We think it is crazy that ancient titles are still priced at full price years after they launch. We think its nuts that if you miss a flash sale by an hour you have to pay full price, or wait months to get the game you want today. That is why we built Last Best Offer, to give people a place to pay a fair price for the things they want today, without having to wait for the next sale. 

If you want to wait a month to save an extra buck or two, that's great! More power to you! If you're getting a good deal and supporting game devs, we're happy. 

Thanks for your honest feedback, we always welcome it."

"No idea. However, if there is multiplayer gambling, at least in the US they should be fine even with purchasable shark cards. 

Gambling traditionally requires money in -&gt; random event -&gt; money out. Without a method of converting in game currency to USD then it fails the money out requirement. 

One exception to this was in Washington State where a woman sued a mobile social casino operator for lost winnings. A judge made a decision that the operator was in fact running an illegal gambling operation (despite the lack of an avenue for the money out requirement) and ordered the operator to recoup the plaintiff accordingly. However, as far as I know this ruling has had no further impacts on the social casino market. Further, I don’t believe the judge was a federal judge (could be wrong) so if anything I believe there is only precedent in Washington state for this lack of a requirement of money out for a service to be classified as gambling.

"Right, the creators don't know why it's being censored. The petition expressly says just that: is it because it's an anime game or because it's fanservice? They let previous games on their platform like this one and didn't censor it, suddenly they do. It's in bad taste.

If it's an anime game then are they going to censor all anime games? What if it has other non-fanservice content they don't like are they going to censor that too? Is it the fanservice? What if they censored NieR Automata to remove 2B's skirt and the ability to peek up it? That game had fanservice too.

It's just a slippery-slope that Sony could go down and until the creators know exactly why the game is being censored, straight from Sony, then it could police a number of games and censor their content too. I think that's what the real issue is: we don't know what the exact issue is.

&gt; Sony allows games like ""The Witcher"" and the like to offer far more fan service. Is anime the reason for it? We do not know it.

According to the petition anyway. And he's not exactly wrong, Witcher 3 allows you to sleep with a variety of women and you see their breasts in a number of ways, so it's just a slippery-slope that's better not to try and slide down in the first place."

"yeah I agree it should stay / make it accessible for console.  Makes sense we should be able to use it from medium heights and large rocks, as it stands there's only a couple places where it actually works.  Even fairly large valley cliffs it doesn't work on.

Surely they can make it not work on level ground though.  There's obviously some kind of height boundary for it (to work without numpad), just bring that down to something like 2 meters  

As well how I would balance it, is make it do a full weapon switch animation when you land.  As it stands now when you land you're gun up ready to fire.  Have you pull your weapon off you back like you swapped weapons and it would be much more dangerous to use in combat.

As it is right now though it's crazy.  If you strafe jump with it you'll hover across a whole room while facing your target, land and boom be able to fire.  You also can switch/start an animation before the jump and it won't cancel it.  

I was in nuke town tunnels and went into that room that has a step to go down into the middle and a raised area around the edges of it.  I ran in, started a swap to a shotgun and batman'd off that one step all the way across the room landing behind the dude and blasted him.  That's a little much.  But I absolutely should be able to wingsuit off a steep hill or 10ft rock.

"I think Lin Wood can apply pressure legally on behalf of a victims family, and through the State Cold Case Homicide Team. I think when he threatened to sue the City of Boulder before, he got Mary Lacy to agree to investigate the Intruder Theory. I think he probably agreed to not sue as long as everything that could be done was being done. So she took over the case and did what she could. She wasn’t happy about what Kolar did and stated in her letter to him that he would be on his own liability-wise. 

I’m not real sure what happened when The Case was returned to BPD. It’s like Beckner decided all the science was invalid and wouldn’t listen to talk of an Intruder. He might have made a mistake there. Finding a trip to Burke’s school during finals week seems pretty stupid to me but it appears he was more than willing... he could have set up the City of Boulder for a Fall of great magnitude."

(This is going to be a very long post)  

Background:  

I am in my first year living on campus at a state university, and this is the first time that I have lived with non family members. I previously attended a community college and drove from home to school and then back. My living space is a suite; it’s a long hallway with three separate rooms, which should have two people each in them, and a kitchen at the end of the hall.  

As I said, each of our rooms should have two people staying in them, but my roommate upgraded to a nicer dorm at the start of the semester, so I have been lucky enough to have my own room. Another one of my suite-mates has probably only been to his room three or four times during the year. This leaves one of my suite-mates, John, with his own room. The only room with two people in it has two exchange students from the Netherlands. So four of us share what should be a six person space. Both of them will only be here for half the year. Lets call them Bob and Jack.  

	When I moved in, Bob was the first person I met. He seemed nice enough, but I immediately noticed  he was extremely talkative and quite loud. Nothing wrong with that, I thought. I met Jack shortly after. He is a really great guy and a good friend. The two of them had already met each other, along with some other Dutch students, as part of their exchange program. Before school started we had a week to settle in, and the four of us hung out a lot. We also hung out with some of the other Dutch exchange students. During this first week I learned that one of the Dutch exchange girls had pretty bad anxiety problems, so Jack helped her whenever she wasn't feeling well. Lets say her name is Jill.

	The first couple of weeks of the school year passed without incident. About a month into the semester, some of the Dutch kids took a weekend trip to Chicago. They shared a couple of rooms together, and after going out for the day they would come back and have some drinks. After the second night, Jill started feeling like she was about to have a panic attack. While Jack tried to help her calm down, Bob started pressing her on why she had anxiety. She said that she had always had issues with it, but when she was back home she was able to control it better because she had a group of friends to talk to about it. Bob continued pressing her, asking if she had a boy who she talked to about her problems when she was home. She said yes she did, and at this point apparently Bob went off into another room and left her alone. This interaction made Jack somewhat upset, thinking that Bob's questioning was rude, but he didn't say anything to him directly.  

	As Jack tried to help her calm down, Bob got onto Google and looked up articles about how anxiety ""isn't real"" and sent them to Jill. He also texted her about how everything she was going through was ""just in her head/she can get over it"". He also apparently sent a sort of ""screenplay"" that he made about Jill and the guy she would talk to back home. In this he talked about how this guy was just making Jill feel ""fake anxiety"" so that he could talk to her.

	Needless to say, the whole group was pretty livid. The Dutch kids did their best to stay away for him for a week or so. During this time, Bob came to me to talk about it. He gave his version of the story. Eventually I figured out that the story he told me was filled with half truths, as I later heard the actual account of what happened from Jack and Jill. Even without getting the actual story, I was straight up with Bob and told him that I thought it was really messed up what he did, and that he should apologize. This was the first time that I thought something could be up with Bob.  

After a few weeks, Bob had somewhat apologized and the Dutch kids started to let him hang out with him again. Jack said that they started feeling badly for him because he had been part of their exchange program, but he admitted they still were quite unhappy with him.  

	About a week later, Jack, Bob, and I where hanging out with two girls from our building. We were just talking for a bit, and everything was going well. At one point Bob changed the subject, asking the girls the girls who they liked. I assumed he was just trying to be flirty, but he started acting really strangely when they said there wasn't anybody they could think of. He started talking about how ""young girls like you two should always have a crush"". They kinda laughed to each other and then he said ""Why are you two laughing? I know there is only three reasons two young, supple, girls like you would be laughing; you're laughing about drugs, boys, or sex."" He continued, saying ""It's got to be one of those three things! Tell me what it is!"". We all became pretty uncomfortable, and Jack and I tried to change the subject. He continued to try and push the girls, and eventually we all decided to head back to our rooms. I would put some other things that he said here, but I don't want to write down anything unless I can 100% remember what he said. I just found this interaction extremely creepy.

	 When I initially moved in I had longish hair, which I had dyed over the summer. It was supposed to come out differently then it had, (eventually it settled into being blonde) so I went and got it cut off. Because I had it dyed to the roots I had to cut my hair very short.

Fast forward another week from us talking to the two girls. When I arrived back at our suite, there was some light-hearted jabs from Jack and Mike, and they talked about how I looked different. Most of their jokes were pretty good! We were sitting around just bantering, and then Bob came in. He had a couple of good jokes as well, then at one point he said I ""looked like a crackhead"". I thought okay that was a good roast, laughed, and forgot about it. (I literally just had short hair and a beard. I don’t look/act/dress like someone who smokes crack. While I might not be appearing on a GQ cover any time soon, I don't think I'm that unattractive of a guy. I am pretty secure with how I look. This is important later on.)  

Next day I'm walking back to my room from class, and I see Bob walking my way. I say hello, and he says ""Oh what's up Cracky, smoke any crack lately?"" I just laughed it off, but I couldn't help but feel that he was trying to make it personal for some reason. A few days later he kept saying essentially the same thing. At this point I told him to stop, because the joke wasn't really funny anymore. Once again I felt that he was going beyond just banter and trying to make it personal.

That weekend Bob, Jack, Jill, another Dutch kid, and I went out and had drinks. Eventually we ended up back at Jill’s apartment, were we decided that we would hang out for a bit. When we got there we sat down on some couches and someone suggested playing music. At this point Bob asked to play a song. Once he picked a song, he sat on the same couch as me. He was being rather loud, but I was aware that he had been drinking, so I wasn't going to kill his fun. I was seated at one end of the couch, and throughout the song he kept scooting closer to me. At one point he started waving his hands in my face and yelling the lyrics in my face. Then he started calling me ""Cracky"" again, along with making remarks about how I was ugly or whatever else. I pushed him away and just kind of ignored him (I didn't want to start a fight). He continued doing this and started calling Jack a ""suck-up"" when he suggested that Bob just sit on the other side of the couch. Eventually the other Dutch Kid and I left back to our rooms.

(I feel that this next part is important to get a perspective on Bob’s personality and how he treats people.)  

Since the beginning of the year, Bob has been leaving messes everywhere. He will leave kitchenware and food just strewn about the kitchen. He hardly washes anything and doesn't ever throw any of his trash away. He will leave messes for so long that the food on the plates/bowls essentially calcifies. My roommates and I started the year by taking turns cleaning the kitchen, even though Bob was the one mostly making the messes. We agreed when we first met it would be unfair to have one person do all the cleaning in our suite. Eventually we stopped eating at the house completely because we would end up washing 1-2 of our dishes and 10+ of Bobs. This is in addition to cleaning up his trash. One day I washed Bob’s dishes for probably 30 minutes and then politely asked him to just try to run water in the bowls when he was done with them. He said he would, and I thought that was that. Later that night I walked out to get water and saw 3 or 4 bowls caked with food sitting on the table. Oftentimes Bob will take Jacks food (eggs, yogurt, etc.) and will eat well over half of it without asking. Bob also will essentially flood the bathroom when showering, and doesn't flush the toilet, even after shitting. Recently he has been knocking on the door as soon as I step into the restroom (we all share one bathroom) and telling me to hurry up. This has happened multiple times just this week. When we asked Bob to stop doing these things he said that he would try, but it was hard for him because he has ADHD.

Two weeks ago the Dutch kids went on another trip, but Bob wasn't invited. I stayed with my friends elsewhere on campus that weekend. John stayed in our suite and informed Jack and I that Bob had moved their beds together because he thought he was going to have a girl over. This was after Bob explicitly told Jack not to touch his bed when he was gone. Jack also has found his stuff moved around recently and he thinks that Bob might be going through his stuff.

	Earlier this week Bob told me that a girl downstairs he had met had a crush on me, and said she thought I was cute. He then proceeded to say that he w"

I love writing and it is what I feel I am the best at.  When I finish this life, I want to leave behind a positive legacy through writing Fantasy and Science Fiction.  Particularly, I would like to write in a way that will lead to greater depth of thought regarding paradigm shifting philosophical questions.  I honestly believe that some of the worlds biggest problems are rooted in the rapidly increasing superficiality of thought among societies. 

The problems that I encounter the most when I try to write are self-doubt and depression.  I find it difficult to actually sit down and begin writing, as I have a bad habit of immediately beginning to over-analyze and over-criticize every word that ends up on the page.  Have you ever dealt with similar issues, and if so, how were you able to overcome them?

He dated his HS sweetheart until his sophomore year of college. She cheated on him terribly, dropped his self esteem, and even lied about losing their virginities together. We both help trust and loyalty as a big facet in our relationship and he even sought counseling to be able to let go of the resentment he held towards her and his mom (The mom was still maintaining a friendship with the ex even though they had been broken up 2+ years and we had been dating for 6-7 months at the time) to better our relationship. Ultimately though he still cheated on me and I would argue that it made it worse for me emotionally because he KNOWS how it feels. "

"&gt; Yes, because it's really a hill to worth dying on. It makes such a huge difference to explain whether people want to fuck pre-pubescent children or pubescent children

Yeah, it does.

If you'd ever seen a child you would know that fucking a pre-pubescent child is hugely physically damaging in addition to pscyological damage, whereas fucking a pubescent child is psyochologically damaging.

There is a reason the legal system differentiates between the two.

The fact that ""lifeboat mode"" actually worked on Apollo 13 is probably due to the point in the mission where the failure took place (i.e. how much total ""lifeboat time"" was required), setting the conditions in the LM with regard to heat, and CO2 at ranges that were probably considered ""threats to life"" in the simulation, and a bunch of NASA and Grumman top tier engineers working continuously throughout the time they were in ""lifeboat mode"" figuring out how to keep fine-tuning systems to keep that little bubble of air and heat just barely habitable; work that probably wasn't done in the simulation."

"&gt;1) I do understand that they are not so disconnected from eachother, otherwise no one would need readjustement surgery.

How does that logic follow? 

&gt;2) Creationists dont look at evidence, they look at the gaps in evidence to fit god inside them.

Transphobes do the exact same thing. 

&gt;I say that at least I, Iam not here to preach or convert people, just want to know what people think. I think it is hard to tell what is going on since the propaganda machine is running full power ahead, and we very well know how this can distort things. I am skeptical, I see something is sold as a solution to a problem, which itself seems to turn into a trend. But of course Iam not deaf to reasonable arguemnts, so i think Ill try to find out more about that by reading more about it and trying to talk to experts.

But to be clear, you haven't presented any evidence to think that a propaganda machine exists - and in reality, the propaganda is coming from the anti-science side that is telling people to ignore all the available evidence. 

Notice that in this entire discussion you are convinced that all the scientists are wrong and they've just been manipulated by some nebulous force, but even accepting that as true, you've presented no evidence or reason to think that your own position is true. 

&gt;btw.:It should also be mentioned that all the downvotes I recieved in this thread are at least an indicator for the overall acceptance of critical opinions. 

Critical opinions are always welcome but opinions without supporting evidence or reason are useless to anyone who cares about truth or open discussion. "

"It’s the full game, progress carries over and the whole game is open to “beta” players. Put it in quotes because this really isn’t a beta, it’s just early access. 

It’s sucks but a few people whose lives revolve around playing and streaming games would have setup their shit buckets and played non stop for however many days the full beta is open to them and everyone else. Soooo much of the game would have been exposed and even if I wasn’t trying to spoil things it would be almost impossible as so many videos would probably show up on reddit and the videos in YouTube feeds etc. 

Plus they’re working out bugs and issues between shit downs. Bethesda is known for bugs and that stuff is usually hilarious when we see videos, but those are single player games. And while they can be irritating it’s much worse when it’s an online game and bugs cost you and others when they happen. Bethesda can’t release this game with a lot of issues or else we will set this sub and everywhere else on fires because of it lols"

Sure, i might have the top income of 1% of the world... i also have the expenses of the top 1%. 

A 3rd world farmer probably has more land than i'll ever see and might be $1000 equivalent cost, meanwhile i paid $1million for a crappy *condo unit* in the city. 

Don't tell me i should feel better about myself when my expenses exceed my income just because my income is better than 99% of the world."

The more times a bacteria or virus divides, the more likely a mutation that improves survival (such as bypassing those barriers created by vaccines) is selected out. So people refusing vaccines not only reduces herd immunity in terms of general protection, but also increases the chances of stronger, more hardy organisms."

"I think it's a complex issue that just clashes with Armenianess. 

It's also a mentality issue that should change with time, or else it wouldn't be such a issue.

 But then again, how much does Armenia have to do to become accepted on this issue? Do they want a society to get to levels comparable to Sweden? What's the agenda? How does this benefit Armenia? I get we welcome a minority of Armenians back and more gay tourists(maybe profittable donations from LGBTQ?) but is the benefit substantial?

"One of my three roommates during college was something that scraped its way out of the depths of hell.

Her and her boyfriend were always doing the most fucked up stuff in private and when people came home or were home. I know about the private things they would do because my roommates and I snooped through her camera when stuff was getting really bad in the apartment.

Her and her boyfriend would fill the bathtub up with lose tea and take pictures of each other stuffing the tea into their genitals. It was disturbing. 

They would also have sex on every surface possible in the apartment and god honest, they would not stop if someone came home. Like.. banging on the kitchen counter... I walk in.. looks at me.. I look at them.... continue to bang. Oh, and condoms everywhere. 

So much of my stuff and my roommates stuff was stolen and sold for drugs. She had people come over that would threaten to beat me with a bat. The list goes on.. but there is this one particular time that just sealed the deal for me; I knew this chick was never going to be able to redeem herself .

&amp;#x200B;

She was very heavy into drugs, any kind, no preference. So the night before midterms my roommates and I are crunch studying and it had to be around 1 30 2 a m. Its a super cold night in the city. All of a sudden I hear what sounds like an army marching down our hallway coming towards the apartment door. Loud voices, heavy boots, a lot of them.

Our roommate is not home so immediately my heart drops into my asshole and I mentally prepare myself for something.. but I never could have prepared for this. Through the front door comes 12 of Boston's nastiest, rattiest, stinkiest, most grotesque street urchins. All drugged out, all reeking of the high heavens. One literally was dressed as a pirate, eye patch and all. Two of them looked like demon ghosts. Some were deff rave kids who had been on the streets for some time. But all of them were just out of this world, crazyyyyyyyyy. 

At this point im peaking my head around the doorway to witness all 12 of them starting to get comfy in our very small living room. Boots are coming off, hair is being shaken out, all of it. 

My roommates and I are freaking out and no one has the balls to confront her about this situation so it ends up falling on my shoulders. 

Me: ""Uh ...Lila.. (fake name) ...What is going on?""

Lila: ""These are my friends. They traded me K for a place to stay for a few days. Its cold out.""

A FEW DAYS?? The house already smells like the inside of a pocket of puss. 

Me: ""No Lila they can't stay we don't have the room and we have midterms tomorrow""

Lila and I argue for a minute and then she proceeds to run into our shared bedroom and lock the door. So its me vs. Boston's finest. It took me a good half hour of arguing and persisting that yes , all of you filthy druggie people need to leave now. Finally, finally, boots are being put back on, hats are being placed on top of their heads and there is some movement to the door. When all of a sudden little Lila comes out of the room and says:

""Before you go let me make you all some tea because its really cold outside.""

And there it was... Bitch is bat shit crazy.

"&gt;Protip: Being a nationalist is unpatriotic and un-American

Tell that to our founding fathers

&gt;Protip: Separating kids from their parents and putting them in concentration camps isn't ""anti illegal immigration""

When you have so many child traffickers coming in through the border, not taking the right precautions is very dangerous, I recall ICE coming out with a statement that a lot of the chidlren they saved didn't come with their biological parent. I certainly hope you aren't advocating for Child Trafficking.

&gt;Protip: Pretty sure the DREAMERs didn't have a say as to whether or not they shoud've crossed the border, considering.... y'know..... they were 2 years old....

Don't give me that Dreamer crap. IF a Merit based immigration system is to actually work then The Dreamers that would contribute to an American society would likely get deals worked out. But regardless unvetted mass immigration is NOT the way to go and being for that is extremely unpatriotic.

Title: **I'm being sued by a credit card company**

Original Post: 

&gt; I've read other similar posts but my story seems to be somewhat unique.
&gt; 
&gt; To boil it down, I'm being sued by one creditor for ~$5500. Currently, I'm over $100K in debt, and have no assets. I'm unemployed (but looking for work) and after reaching out to two law firms (one is for poor/elderly people, the other a bankruptcy firm) I haven't had a response.
&gt; 
&gt; I have 8 days left to answer the complaint, one count of Breach of Contract, and one count of Unjust Enrichment. Any advice on how to proceed would be appreciated.

"Hey man, I agree. I take a lot of it with critical thinking. I don't just subscribe to one single philosophy.
Change is a slow and steady process. Like losing weight. A fat dude can lose 30kg in three months using strict diet and calorie restriction, but how sustainable is this? How healthy is this? And, what are the chances he will just revert back to his old eating habits? Better to change our habits for life and do it over so slow and steady timeframe. No point in over-compensation of our current inadequacies. Best to acknowledge them and work on them honestly, right? Otherwise we're only kidding ourselves.

Redpill for me is about embracing and living our masculinity. Being dominant in our lives in a respectful and playful way. Going after what we want and taking responsIbility for our lives. Accepting that we alone must help ourselves and stop being victims. 
People are complex. Life is complex. Trp is a framework for navigating our lives as men and has been very useful and insightful for me. But it is not a standalone system. It can be integrated with the teachings of many philosophies such as stoicism, Zen Buddhism, Taoism etc. It should come naturally and effortlessly to us. And that takes time and practice. Like meditation. At first it's a chore and difficult, but eventually you see that it is no effort at all. 

There's more to life than teasing, fucking, navigating shit tests and dealing with the women in our lives. But having an understanding of our own masculine identities and how to do all that stuff with a sense of fun and appreciation of women is all part of the big mystery of life. I'm just glad I'm no longer viewing it through the lens and mindset of a bluepilled sap."

Title: **I rear-ended someone and they want to file a claim even though there was no damage**

Original Post: 

&gt; I very lightly rear-ended someone last week. There appeared to be no damage from the collision, but she claimed that I cracked and scratched her bumper. She was very flustered and had no idea what to do (didn’t know what information to exchange, thought to call the police, etc.) so I just told her to take pictures of both cars and of each other’s licenses. No one was hurt so once we exchanged information we both left. 
&gt; 
&gt; A few days go by and now she texts me:
&gt; “we had a car accident last week. My insuarance needs the copy of your car insuarance. Could you please send  me the copy? Thank you.”
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to know if there were any ways around this as I don’t want my insurance rate to go up exponentially. I would definitely be cooperative and willing to exchange my insurance information if it wasn’t for the fact that there was no damage done and it was an older car so she could have claimed that any prior wear and tear was due to the collision. Would it be possible to work around this so that she can’t file a claim? Am I legally required to send her my insurance information (especially since she didn’t get it when the collision occurred)? Let me know what you all think about this. 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I understand if this sounds stupid and I’m being ridiculous. Just thought to throw it out there and see what people thought
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

One thing I do is I just give a verbal cue to my class on whether its okay to shout answers out or if I want to call on kids. I rarely require hand raising, I prefer to cold call using name cards to get a better idea of the capabilities of everyone and not just the loud kids.

I like letting them be stoked and yell out when they're excited to know things, and I think there's a time and place for it, so I make the call on an activity by activity basis. I either say ""just yell it"" if it's a short response, or raise hands if it's brainstorming or longer thoughts. Occasionally, if there's just too many kids talking, I just tell them: I get overwhelmed when you're all yelling at me, let's raise hands instead. Consistently reminding them of expectations is enough for 80 percent of them to do what you ask.

"Okay so there are probably a lot of factors. Firstly, you said working for 4 years and you're 28. Most people would finish undergrad at 22. So thats 2 years right there.

Second is schooling. Everyone leaves with a different situation. I studied in Canada so cost was lower, but I did put 40-50k of my own money against it.

COL of course impacts it as well. Rent in Toronto for example for shared apartment is \~1250.

The rest should largely be controllable. A 90K income is probably like 60k after tax? Take out 23k for rent and maybe say 10k for other annual expenses. If you hunkered down you should have been able to save \~30k a year. Not counting for school of course, but also not counting for any summer jobs etc. 

Anyhow. Thats generally how ive seen it work. Pay off schooling quickly with summer jobs and such. Say 40-50k of your own money. Start off saving 30-50k a year depending on location, salary, etc. Have that grow in a high performing career quite rapidly. E.g. 140k maybe means 90k take home. Expenses go up a bit, but only like 5k max. Now you're saving 55k a year instead of 30k. That over 8 years + market returns could get to around a million by 30."

MDMA + nitrous is just wonderful. Orgasmic. Feels so amazing. Enhanced visuals.

"https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2018/04/25/in-scathing-pre-election-report-auditor-general-says-deficit-is-117b-not-67b.html

This will get you started. CBC has some write-ups on it too if the star's paywall gets in the way.

Basically search for ""auditor general Ontario 2018 report"" and you'll get more info.

The long and short of it is Ontario was using an older accounting standard that understates the size of the deficit. The Auditor General criticized the Liberals for this and the PCs made a lot of hay of it.

Big things were how to count surpluses in pension accounts (overcontributions) and where debts associated with hydro subsidies  (to bring down people's bills) should be counted.

I don't have an opinion on who was right about the accounting standard, although it seems clear the Liberals were fairly cynical in their choice of a standard that made them look better.

The big take away at this time though, is this all came out well before the election and is something the PCs would have been very familiar with. No new facts came to light, no new debts, just how they were counted. So when Ford says they were blindsided by higher than expected debts, he is lieing."

"Part of its popularity comes from its ability to suppress the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight), which becomes overactive in withdrawal from opioids, alcohol, benzos, and barbiturates. This overactivity leads to symptoms like sweating, high heart rate and blood pressure, and anxiety.

Its binding to alpha2 adrenoceptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) can protect them from being easily overexcited by CAMP (and deactivated as a result), which may help improve impulse control. The PFC is often thought of as ""the administrator"" - overseeing things and helping to keep impulses in check while promoting planning and decision-making. It's thought to be the center of dysfunction in disorders such as ADHD.

Odd as it is, it's a unique and helpful component of treating addiction and dependence. An analogue, lofexidine, was recently approved in the US to help reduce the physical symptoms of opioid withdrawal. It can make a huge difference for people trying to get over their chemical dependencies; replacement therapy isn't suitable for everyone. "

Colorado ranks 19th in GDP, 22nd in population and is the 8th largest state. It had 246 law enforcement agencies employing 12,069 sworn police officers, about 245 for each 100,000 residents in 2008.

Yet, the state with highest *rate* of police killings (2013 - 2017), New Mexico, is 36th in population, 37th in GDP and is the 5th largest state. It had 146 law enforcement agencies employing 5,010 sworn police officers, about 252 for each 100,000 residents.  "

"To be honest I saw this come up the other day and I had a glance at it and it just looked like too much effort for something that I wasn't 100% sure about. Learning the planes is time consuming enough, I just don't have the patience to read through a manual just to play a campaign. Especially one that might not even be supported by the developer in the future as is known to happen with these things. We really need something ED is willing to get behind and back."

"100 is still easy enough for a brief interaction like that. That's as high as I'll go if I'm hanging out with a couple sober friends.

150+, I like to be able to just zonk out, but find 100 fairly manageable

Does vary person to person. I have one friend that on 100 doesn't handle sober people well at all, but most of us are good at that level"
It is possible. But any private courier service would be liable for their records of pickup and delivery of said package(s) to said locations from said sender(s). A legitimate federal investigation would have no problem tracing it back to the source if that were the case.

"A while back the same thing happened to my mom with a fake Tory Burch Bag! Their “experts” said it was authentic even though it was missing all of the authentication pieces, and the seller admitted she wasn’t sure if it was authentic. The seller ended up saying hey give her money back because I’m really not sure. 

Posh first sends my mom an email saying oh it’s authentic we’re sending it back to you. Then a few minutes later sent another email saying actually the seller said to return it, so it’s going back to her. The kicker was in the initial return email, Posh said if it was fake it would be sent back to the seller.... not destroyed like it should be. 

Their authentication is AWFUL. If twitter and social media doesn’t help, worst case scenario I would call your bank and request a charge back. I wish I knew in what world Durderry was real 😂"
