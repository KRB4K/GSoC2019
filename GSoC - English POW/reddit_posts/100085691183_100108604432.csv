My thighs and butt cheeks are probably the cleanest parts of my body - as soon as I step out of the shower they are covered with clothing, only to come out of isolation when I have to use the restroom. 

OP - leave a sign asking for people to clean up after themselves. If the mystery hover pee-er doesn‚Äôt change their ways, leave a passive aggressive note about how hover peeing hurts everyone. "

"S√≥ um adendo pra te ajudar a tentar convencer outros isentos:

Isentos (como eu) n√£o v√£o deixar de votar nulo na base de ""um √© mais arriscado que o outro"" j√° que boa parte de quem vota nulo n√£o se importa ou j√° aceita que o pa√≠s ta destinado ao fracasso. 

Na minha percep√ß√£o, mudar o voto de quem vota nulo (principalmente desses √∫ltimos 10% que o Haddad desesperadamente precisa [convenhamos, quem quer que eu n√£o vote nulo, quer que eu lacre 13 na urna]) √© mais dif√≠cil do que mudar o voto de um eleitor ativo, pois vc tem que dar esperan√ßa (convencer que as propostas do Andrade mudaram e s√£o altru√≠stas ~~[coisa que n√£o d√° mais tempo]~~) e convenc√™-lo que n√£o est√° se fazendo de hip√≥crita, enganado, porcentagem de manobra e gado quando ele digita 13 na urna.

Acho que de pior, se o PT ou a milit√¢ncia encher muito o saco desses 10%, eles podem aumentar a margem da vit√≥ria do bolso apenas por revanchismo (Coisa que tava acontecendo at√© semana passada e pode voltar se o PSOL realmente bloquear o Zap por 48 horas.

In both of our episodes, the car ended up in worse condition than it began - it‚Äôs amazing how they can get away with damaging peoples cars to hook you into asking for more.

I learned my lesson that day, and as a result I have a simple rule I tell anyone who solicits me for a product or service: **I only work with people or companies I seek out. By approaching me, the person has disqualified themself.**

This works equally well for door-to-door salespeople. And those young adult magazine / candy sale scams.

"If you bothered to keep reading both passages go on to explain they said nothing of tomb to any man EXCEPT those who had been with him aka his disciples. That's the problem with nitpicking a line here and there from the Bible to argue against it, if you just keep reading or use it against someone who knows the Word you just look stupid. 

Now for the record, you're gonna wanna hit your knees, repent your sins and believe with your heart that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that God raised him up from the dead. Baptism is great as a symbolic gesture but the only way to be saved is to be washed in the blood of savior and be born again.

Edit: just to knock this one even further home for those who will read this but aren't gonna go look up the verses in the VERY NEXT LINE IN MATTHEW 28:9 ""As they went to tell his disciples,behold Jesus met them, saying,ALL HAIL. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.""

In Mark 16:9-18 it talks about Mary Magdalene also telling his disciples, Jesus returning to them Himself and how He instructed His disciples to go forth and preach the resurrection to the unbelievers.

"Firstly they asked for you to help have the women( your friends)  come forward which you tried and they refused, how is that your fault that they want to bury their heads in the sand?  They may not use you at all because whatever you told them is second hand and the people it happened to are washing their hands not getting involved. The investigators can find out who these women are it's not impossible without your help. Personally I think you're working yourself up because of the state of your mental health. Someone who is stable has rational thought is empathetic can weed out what's good, bad and RIGHT. I'd cooperate because you may think something he did around you was nothing but it can help put him away. Each time you question yourself picture the young woman's mother finding her daughters body can you honestly live with that image for the rest of your life? Part of being a human being means doing selfless acts for the greater good,  no rewards, no pat on the back. Ask yourself what's the worst that can happen here? You did not commit a crime someone who you used to know, a former friend did and you want to just forget about it, back out? This is not a concert ticket or a dinner date it's life......the universe throwing you a curve ball and you're declining to participate. The Universe always wins whether it's today, tomorrow life times from now.  It's a bit of your time, it's not going to put you in jail,  you are helping put a criminal behind bars who can not harm you in any way.... it's not like you're dealing with the mafia or a gang where your life or families well being is at risk.

My experience was that the ED was a breeding ground for all those with chronic pain, drug seekers, psychosomatic illness, psychological issues and the inebriated.

"I mean... everybody wants to blame the UFC here, but if anything you should blame the fans. It's the *fans* who want the shit talk, who want the ""entertainment"". Unfortunately, the casual UFC fan is a wannabe alpha male douchebag who wants to see blood/shit talk. The UFC is a business that makes money off prize-fighting, and they're going to pay fighters more who sell more PPVs; they need to be profitable. It's not much different from the commission I make on sales at work. I'm not saying that fighters shouldn't be paid more overall, I agree with that, but being upset with the UFC for not paying DJ more when he has some of the *lowest* headlining PPV's in UFC history is a bit crazy. I think there's a good chance this was an amicable decision between DJ and the UFC, similar to Eddie's move. There's not much left for DJ in the UFC, ONE provides him a new avenue to make more $$$."

But they're not any stronger then Kensei or Highlander or any of the current top tiers like zerk etc... They're new ppl don't know how to fight them optimally yet same thing everytime new heroes drop honestly. Personally fighting against them with non dlc characters myself I think their fine. Great design but not particularly broken in any way. Then again I fought and practiced against them in arena to learn a bit on how to fight against them. But the Wulin don't have any unreactable 50/50 BS they just have great mix up potential just like Kensei. I can't call that OP.

"&gt;But such social norms are not beholden to anyone that does not have a prior and expressed agreement to them

No more than me not ass-raping you. If I don't believe in the fee fee bodily autonomy idea you have I cant rape you.

&gt;Unless they are enshrined into law or in some other way enforced by violence against those that do not believe in them

Negative rights aren't enforced by violence, social property enforcement is a positive right like I already stated.

&gt;they are not ""rights"", they're just social customs. 

Like the concept of freedom, or a not-raped asshole.

&gt;they're not enshrined into law and otherwise are just feel good notions that some people believe in personally. 

Like literally everything in society.

&gt;""Rights"" as portrayed by Right-Libs are nothing more than ""muh feels.""

Using deconstruction is a double edged sword. You cant pick and choose what ""social norms"" are real or not. Rights are social norms, sure, so is literally everything that happens after first contact with another being. When your argument boils down to ""nothing matters, nothing social is real"" you cant then turn around and advocate for made up concepts like freedom, class, or social harmony."

Didn't do the placement yet this season, was Gold 2 at the end of Para Bellum. The thing that triggers me the most is when an unranked level 20 or a Copper 2 blames me for the lost match, cause in their head I'm a level 261 and I should do all the job, without a single piece of info (cause most of them don't even bother communicating) and having to deal with their big mistakes like TKs while trying to open rotation holes with nitrocells between bombsites, placing gadget in completely useless spots (for example, a Frost trap under that window in Trophy Room on Chalet where the attackers can't rappel) or wasting them for no reason (like using all 3 Smoke's nades in the same spot at the same time) and so on. And no, ""it's casual"" is not an excuse, it's the matchmaking that's completely broken: a level 20 should play with and against people around the same level and learn, not being placed with a level 261 and against Plats, it's frustrating for both them and us."

* Do the same as the table, but return a JSON and call it a webservice/api/rest/cloud/pony.

The bug red flag for me was that he insisted that we buy it on his ""account"". He wouldn't tell me why, but it was probably because that's how he got credit for it.

It sucked because he was an amazing chiropractor, and he was honest about my back. He was one of the only ones to show me what was wrong on X-Rays and explain in detail why I was having those symptoms. It even checked out when I did research. The week or two that I went there was great because I had never felt better.

I'm looking for virtually anyone within a business, those who want to sell their service is important, but also having ""buyers"" or people interested in software benefitting their company or their work life is important as well."

"Well I'll try to play devils advocate here... The manipulation qualm probably comes from the fact he was rocketed to infamy/fame by his SJW objections, and his self help persona, as self help books like 12RFL have a negative ""snake oil"" like connotation. Like any self help author he presents answers to broad problems that many face, his demographic happens to be young white men, which is not currently ""in vogue"" to say the least. 

Your parents being left leaning is certainly a big factor in seeing him negatively as JP has many right wing positions. The only thing to do about that is to present a broad objective view of JP not mired in tribalistic political leanings. heh

My only problem with JP is his fast and loose style of interpreting mythology such as the bible as being a significant account of human psychology, because he is so ambiguous on his own obvious religious leanings. Which I can't blame him for, but I am distrustful of his interpretations of the physiological significance of biblical archetypal... anything really because it seems a disingenuous way to promote Christianity, as he seems to present Christian morals are Christian in origin. Thats probably my flawed understanding, but I'm still apprehensive of any religious promotion from JP be it morals or traditions as I'm pretty against any religious institution/corporation. 

That all said, I don't really give a flying dingle berry about the political or religious side of JP. I don't have a side in transgender issues, freedom of speech, and can separate virtuous morals from religious dogma just fine. Its not a problem with me if JP is a Christian in the closet. I'm just trying to clean my room, JP is just some guy that helps motivate me into disciplining my manchild self to do so. 

And there are quite a few that have brewed up JP coolaid and drunk wayy too much of it to the point they think him infallible, but that minority is to be found in any group. Hope this helps mang "

"I am a nurse and I can tell you I‚Äôve worked with many types of people over the course of my career. I‚Äôve seen people at the lowest points of their lives and they tell me about the lives they‚Äôve lived. I‚Äôve been there to help both those who wanted the help and those that didn‚Äôt but needed it anyway.

Those that are selfish and inconsiderate are some of the most miserable people I‚Äôve encountered, and they also tend to suffer the most‚Äîat their own hands‚Äîbecause they can‚Äôt look beyond their own circumstances to consider that they need to be a bigger person to get past the challenges they face. Instead they cave in to their egos and they let themselves shrivel up and die and they refuse to do anything for themselves because they feel entitled to make everyone else around them do it for them since they can‚Äôt be bothered. Many could have done just fine in their recovery if they reconsidered the attitude they brought to the situation but they made things so much harder for themselves and those around them by insisting they didn‚Äôt need to put in the effort to make a meaningful change that would make a difference.

And for what? A smug sense of self satisfaction that they don‚Äôt owe a damn thing to anyone else and that all they can do is suffer, that nothing can be done to improve their situation because they can‚Äôt be bothered to consider otherwise? All that does is ultimately reflect inward and dull their motivation to actually do something about what‚Äôs wrong with them. 

You don‚Äôt help yourself with an attitude like that, you drag yourself down to terrible depths and make things so much harder for yourself and everyone who will tolerate you enough to stand by you until they see you for who you are‚Äîa self-centered and awful excuse for a human being who can‚Äôt be bothered to feel more than contempt for those who don‚Äôt share you blood or your favor."

"Most of them do. However, violence in parts of Mexico is as bad as in the Northern Triangle. In 2017, journalist Edwin Rivera fled threats in Honduras, only to be murdered in Veracruz, Mexico. Mexican cartels have also kidnapped Central Americans en masse, demanding ransom money from any family members in the United States. ‚ÄúMexico is not a safe place for thousands of migrants and refugees that flee the violence of Central America.""

They're humans trying to live escaping violence.

Those seeking asylum in Mexico have a better chance of winning their cases with half of completed applications by Hondurans approved there. Furthermore, applicants are not held in detention but released while they wait, as long as they stay in the same state..

Whereas in U.S. courts¬†denied 88 percent of asylum applications from Mexicans between 2012 and 2017, as well 79 percent of those from El Salvador and 78 percent of those from Honduras. This is apart from being detained and having their children seperated by the agents."

"Husband and Father here. My wife plays sometimes too, but has kind of Fallen^^^heh off since forsaken came out. She loved D1 and thought D2 was a shit show in the beginning but stuck with it, and stuck with Me thru it. She felt like I was distancing myself *from her*, when I was really just so excited about the game that I didn't recognize the flaw in it..

We've had talks and ultimatums, and more talks.. but in the end it is a hobby and passion of mine, and she recognizes that. We spend much more time together since we had our low point. 
I would suggest just going out and having a great time, redirect Destiny chatter to other games or movies and keep his focus on YOU! 

Ultimatums don't do well in my opinion, but you need to draw a line and stand your ground. Give plenty of notice (and frequent reminders) of plans you've made for the two of you to have Couple Time and get out of the house. Go adventuring, go dine out (Spicy Ramen dates are nice lol,) Just get him out of the house and occupied.

Another tip I've seen is to Play along side him in game. This is a great idea, but if you're not into Destiny, then just keep him company and bug him about how bad he's doing ;) jk jk. Your interest towards his time spent gaming translates to time interested in his hobby. 

Hope this helps, and Good Luck!"

"The 5e Witcher class was linked in this thread already, check that out.

Also check out [Grit and Glory](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LDHolQY2FURKf-8xCT3) by  [u/theapoapostolov](https://www.reddit.com/user/theapoapostolov) for a variety of optional rules to ""gritty up"" the system, if that's something you want. A Witcher-like world can be run with standard 5e just fine, I imagine, but Grit and Glory might have a rule or two you want to pilfer.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to drop the level of magic down to something more Witcher-esque, there's also [this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19k7snBFvi9bm2AVRgSN3Yk0dd3stGfNV) file of low-magic caster classes. I can't for the life of me remember where I got this from, or who made it, which really sucks because it's one of my favourite homebrews. If anyone knows who made it, please let me know so I can properly attribute them in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Anywhoozle, I think the low-magic caster classes in that file are great, and more fitting for the setting. If you're playing a dedicated mage or sorceress, standard 5e spellcasters might be a better fit, but for anyone else the low-magic variants are probably better."

I was a sales associate at best buy and one day a lady comes in and tells me right away that she doesn't want to pay full price for anything, so I explain I'll have to get a manager for any discount. The manager on duty was this guy Johnny who was super cool and wouldn't take shit from customers very often if they tried to pull stuff on him. I tell the lady that the manager isn't one to budge and before I can go get him she says, watch, I bet I'll be able to break him and get something, I always do. So I'm like fuuuuck, and sure enough this lady goes wacky on him until he breaks and he gives her a $20 voucher. Johnny wasn't too shook by it, and said that gift cards end up netting the company more than if they didn't have one, but it still made me mad that this lady probably goes to every store and acts like this no matter what.

I later worked for Amazon and saw they keep track of every concession given to an account, so they can stop people just seeking free stuff, but it's just such a shame that there are people like that in the first place always trying to game the system."

Their worst season was 10 years ago when they finished with 1 point and -104 goal difference - they improved a bit, but have gone backwards recently.  

They got beat 2-1 during pre-season by South Lochaber Thistle, an amateur team from Kinlochleven who play in the Greater Glasgow Premier amateurs. Only 20 miles further up the road - still a lot of travel but that might be better for them. Or wait and see what happens with the North Juniors and the pyramid below the Highland League."

"I'd highly recommend the PasswordMaker [program](https://passwordmaker.org/passwordmaker.html) and [app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passwordmaker/gnfjppomohbcojfccghjcgahfofgmgdn). PasswordMaker is different from  most password solutions as it doesn't store your password at all. Instead it generates a unique, secure password based on the address of the website, along with parameters you select that will be the same every time. This means as long as you know the parameters, you never need to store or even remember any passwords at all. - PasswordMaker will always generate the same one for that site every time.

It takes a master password you supply, and using whichever alghorithm you select, hashes that with the parts of the url you specify. Basically the same non-reversable process a website does when it encrypts your password to store. This process coupled with the other options you select - password length, character set, l33t and fixed prefix/suffix - all contribute to ensure your password is random and efectively unguessable. As long as you remember your chosen settings and use them consistently the process is infinitely repeatable.

The power and universality of this process is based in consistency. So, if you do use it I'd offer three suggestions: 

First would be to manualy enter a plain name for the URL instead of letting the app enter it automatically - i.e.: use ""reddit"" instead of the offered reddit.com. This means  websites which change their URL structure won't destroy your system. This also lets you use the same process to generate passwords for real-world situations that don't correlate to a specific URL - say a phone-banking, wifi or PC password. 

Secondly I'd suggest you limit your character set to numbers, lower and upper-case as some websites still specifically reject symbols which will break the consistency (and the usability) of your system. If this seems a little dangerous - remember you can use a custom character-set, changing the order and elements of the set.

Finally I'd suggest you include a suffix or prefix consisting of one uppercase, one lowercase and one number. This is because some sites demand that you include at least one of each and as PasswordMaker uses a random hash it *could* generate a password missing one of these again causing you consistency issues.

Hope that helps, hope you like PasswordMaker."

"Do you think 14yo children should be liable for child support? Are they mature enough to be a parent? Does a 14yo understand the full ramifications of their actions? 

Kids wanting to have sex or not is not the issue. Kids may want to drink hard lemonade too but its still illegal for an adult to provide alcohol to a child. We know there are consequences for children who are still developing their brains and their sense of self. 

Not to mention the power imbalance between a teacher and student. Does the 14yo know they *can* say no? What kind of trouble might they get in if they deny an adult who has authority over them? 

That's why we charge adult men with rape. It has nothing to do with whether or not a 14yo girl ""wanted it""."

You long-press. This is mostly not a big deal but makes it near-impossible to do if your character is moving.
"We were laying in the back of my car, and I was looking in his eyes and I started to cry because of how overwhelming it was just to spend time with him.
The look of concern that his face flipped into is a way nobody had ever looked at me. I could tell he really cared about me and loved me. It was that moment that I knew I was all in. He had just been my friend up until that point.

I‚Äôm obsessed with this man. We do absolutely everything together. I‚Äôm so grateful I found him and trusted my gut that we should be together. I ‚Äúloved‚Äù my previous partner, but it was not the ravenous passionate drive and fondness I feel for my husband."

"At the last place I worked for, things were frequently chaotic and stressful. Management paid lip service to ""work/life balance"" and ""recognizing and rewarding excellence"" but the reality was that you were either in the owner's inner circle of people who were trusted because they would always do exactly what he would do in the same circumstance, or you were basically there until you found something better. 
  
At the ground level, motivation was mostly the same way it is in a military unit - you aren't putting in extra effort because you believe in the American Way of Life. You're doing it because you don't want to BF the guy next to you in the trench. The difference is that it's a lot easier to get out of a job than it is to get out of the Army, so turnover there is HUGE. In a company with a max headcount of about 50 people at the peak, they've had almost 60 people leave or get fired (usually for cultural rather than performance issues) in the last 24 months. And this is in an industry (digital publishing) where it's easy to network and find other jobs, but the competitor companies tend to have people with 5+ years because they aren't miserable. "
"you are confusing subs and bits. 

For subs its generally 50/50 but as you noted some popular streamers get a better cut.  

One bit is always worth 1 cent, there is no contract about that. 

However when you buy a bit, you are paying more than 1cent. For example 1,4$ for 100bits, the ratio gets better the more bits you buy."
"I have no problems seeing how it's not a game for everyone. But personally i think it looks good. Sure it doesn't sound too good when described as ""kill, loot, repeat"". But lots of games doesn't sound too good when just described like that. I mean, the first FEAR is basicly just ""Shoot slowed enemies, walk trough dark scary places for a while, repeat"", but yet it's an amazing game.

For me, fallout 76 have many of the things i've been wanting in other multiplayer survival games i've played. Such as an (imo) decent crafting/building system and not having to play constantly or join the biggest clan on the server to avoid having your base raided on a regular basis. Will it be the best game i've ever played? Probably not. But it's easy to tell that it'll be far from the worst."
"I think there is a consistent theme in your post, and it's that you have bad habits which seek immediate pleasures. Not saying you can't ever eat unhealthy, masturbate, and look at your phone, but too much of those habits are harmful to your long-term physical and mental health.

You can seek counseling, but I believe there are things you can do to help improve your situation: 

1. Exercise. Learn how to lift weights and learn how to run properly. You can search /r/fitness for some good advice on youtube channels for proper form and what exercises to do. 

2. Learn how to cook and eat healthy. There are many healthy food options at the grocery store that you just can't find at mr paninos or lazeez, it's also really cheap and fun once you get a legit recipe down and can meal prep for an entire week.

3. Listen to podcasts. It will keep you productive when not studying and prevent you from using your phone because you should be listening to it! 

4. Start decreasing your masturbation rate, try to work your way down to once per day, from there, you can keep progressing to 2-3x/week.

5. Set specific times for phone/internet use and also use a website blocker for porn and reddit so you can get shit done."

"We have never had that happen. It‚Äôs a pretty rare event. This is because in order to have surgery, people are required to follow what are called the ‚ÄúWPATH Standards of Care‚Äù.

These are criteria that guide patient, medical, mental health, and surgical providers to vet each person exploring GAS. So that process does help to make sure the people that get to the point where surgery is a reality are actual candidates for surgery.

What we do see more often are people who have difficulty in dealing with surgery complications, or people who experience post surgical depression, which is multifactorial, but related to things like reaction to anesthesia, difference in reality of results vs  fantasy of results, expectation management, and post op physical/emotional support.

We have noticed that a way that we can help reduce this for our patients is 

1) Providing ample patient education.

2) Having frank and open discussions about patient expectations.

3) Being available and communicative w our patients post op. 

4) When patients have complications and need help, like further surgeries or other medical interventions, we stick with them until we cross the finish line.

You can't tell me that money wouldn't have been better spent on the OL or a CB. Again though, every team with a top tier QB deals with these kind of issue.

"I'm bad and I don't play him often, but try and throw in more in each combo. For example, your WQ can be improved to make it W + AA + Q during a shorter trade, since you can cancel the aa animation(?), and afterwards you back off and try to avoid getting hit by them making it a good trade for you. The AA helps you to proc electrocute if you have it. As I say I'm not that good, but I go w/aa/q/aa/e when I'm fighting. 

And from what I know yes pantheon is good early game so you need to play aggressive within reason (again, that's my understanding), but as all champions are if you are sufficiently fed by midgame you will still have an advantage over your opponents and do good damage."

"Well if we‚Äôre going to be fair, let‚Äôs provide a little additional context

Here‚Äôs what their other expert, a mechanical engineer named Guillermo Rein, is quoted as saying:

&gt; He said a fire with a base measuring several meters on each side, well fed with solid and liquid fuel (such as gasoline or diesel), would generate temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees for several hours. Placing the bodies on a raised pyre would put them where the highest temperature would be found, ensuring their cremation.


Can you guess what this doesn‚Äôt even remotely describe

I‚Äôll give you a hint, it‚Äôs the circumstances under which Avery ostensibly cremated the remains of Halbach‚Äôs body

Unless you have evidence of a pyre that literally nobody has ever noticed before in nearly a decade and a half of intense public scrutiny 

As for Pope‚Äôs comment

&gt; ""Pope, who has worked on many criminal cases in the United States because of her expertise in incinerated bones, also said it is possible to burn a human body in one or two hours with very little wood or just a single tire and a bit of diesel.""


Did she mean it was possible to *burn* a human body in a few hours under these circumstances, or that it was possible to *cremate* the body in a few hours under these circumstances, to the point where all that remained is a handful of bones

Did she say that it‚Äôs possible to do this using *only* ‚Äúvery little wood or just a single tire‚Äù and ‚Äúa bit of diesel,‚Äù or are there other necessary components or circumstances which the piece just didn‚Äôt quote

Did she claim that this process somehow magically causes some of the body‚Äôs bones to teleport to other locations miles away

I don‚Äôt know, there‚Äôs no direct quote and no other information provided‚Äîso I guess it all ultimately depends on whether or not we believe in the laws of thermodynamics, which render the idea that Avery cremated almost all of Halbach‚Äôs body in the fire pit (a fire pit which also obliterated any of the physical evidence such an event would leave behind, and also somehow caused parts of the body to somehow travel to various locations on adjacent properties) ridiculous to such a laughable extent that it‚Äôs genuinely difficult to fathom how any rational adult would still believe in this theory enough to actually waste time trying to defend it as if it were in any way legitimately plausible"

"&gt;Of course a fetus is incapable of such things as consent. For example, a fetus does not consent to be aborted.

Since we've just established fetuses can't consent to anything this is irrelevant.

&gt;Bodily autonomy does not include autonomy over another person's body; in this case, the body of the fetus. 

By having autonomy over your own body, you have a say in other people using your body against your will. You do not have a right to force others to use their bodies to sustain you. 


&gt;Again, actions have consequences. If you consent to sex, you consent to childbirth, because childbirth is the natural end of sex. 

Consequences are not the same as consent. Not all pregnancies come from consensual sex. 

&gt;I've nothing more to say, you can continue to pretend that people can do whatever they want with zero consequences 

Being forced into childbirth is a consequence of having a government that doesnt recognize bodily autonomy. Its not a consequence of sex. 

But unrelated to abortion, of course we should work to prevent and reduce harmful consequences from happening. That's a good thing. "

"Let me give you a personal example. My son is muslim, because of his mother. School is mandatory, and we can't chose his teacher or even his school unless we pay to go private. Now we would be both appaled if his teacher wore a tchador, or even a hijab because kids look up to their teachers; and we really dont want him to look up to this side of islam and think this is normal. Especially with the kids who got radicalized in school and left (or tried) to fight in Syria. Religion is a private matter and we want to control the message he gets from it. Yet there are teachers wearing tchador and hijab now so its a possibility that it happens.

Say you are a muslim and the judge is wearing a kippa. Are you getting a fair trial? Maybe you are, maybe you are not, but you certainly dont have the appearance of a fair trial, and thats a grave issue.

We went to a cook-your-own-steakhouse once. It's a pretty neat place, you obviously pay a bit more for a steak than you normally would, but they have a giant grill and you get to talk to other people cooking and there's tons of different oils and spices. Anyway, my friend walks up to the grill, puts his 16oz filet mignon down on the grill for 20 seconds - then flips it for another ten, and pulls it off. I was shocked, saying ""There's no way that's safe to eat."" But he just sat there, chewing on his goddamn steak as if it was saltwater taffy, going ""MMMMMmmmm soooOOOoooooo good.""

"&gt;Shileds are only useful when you could perfectly parry each attack

You're implying blocking is ever an option for an experienced player.

There's a reason frontline is the most garbage item and it's on the verge of being removed in 1.1.

&gt;and there are still weapons that are more useful and easier to handle.

Shields are extremely strong secondaries. The only contestants are icebow and hokuto. Double shields are also viable. You just hate shields but it's fine.

&gt;To adress what I mentioned in the post, do you think constant accumulation of Malaise from damage field and the lack of means to reduce it is fair? 

Absolutely. If you got caught in a field, it's your fault. If you still find it problematic...

...try having a shield.

"""Mmmhmmm"""
"Former alumni of the same university just 8 or so years earlier.

My theory concerns the following piece of classic literature that was chosen for us to study that year.

 I, Mohamed Atta, have a question to answer your question. As you, Mohamed Atta, travel to Jannah Paradise by conventional means, the normals you travel with experience malfunctions. As you realize ALL THAT IS LEFT is total self-destruction, do you, Mohamed Atta, show self-pity? DO YOU, Mohamed Atta, try to reason why? Do you, Mohamed Atta, try and comfort the normals that have even more fear than you? Or do you, Mohamed Atta, kick the doors out? Kick the cockpit door down. Take the two pilots that have already made the sacrifice so that you can face the challenge. Dispose of them, Mohamed Atta. Assume the controls, Mohamed Atta. SHOVE THAT CONTROL INTO A NOSEDIVE, Mohamed Atta! Push yourself to total self-dstruction. As you realize, Mohamed Atta, you are about to enter a world close to Parts Unknown. Ah, smell it, warriors. Do you, Mohamed Atta, look for a place to hide? Or do you, Mohamed Atta, face the challenge that may be more powerful than EVEN YOU ARE, Mohamed Atta! You, Mohamed Atta, must self-destruct so that you will know, Mohamed Atta, who is‚Ä¶The Chosen One. FOR Mohamed Atta, I am not the Chosen One‚Ä¶that you speak of. I am not. I, Mohamed Atta, am the only one.

Whilst many did and still do argue the significance and foresight in relation to 9/11 and that of a man convincing himself to become a martyr. I still to this day swear it's simply the fucking Ultimate Warrior asking Ho Kogan questions as if he is Ho Kogan leading up to Wrestlemania 7. Along with the mention of 'warriors' and 'parts unknown' (ironically the known birthplace of The Ultimate Warrior) it's that very final line that has me convinced..... ""I am not the Chosen One‚Ä¶that you speak of. I am not. I, Mohamed Atta, am the only one.

Anyway that's my theory!"
"At first the feminism was just about the small things. Then the sexual revolution started; again it was just about relatively (compared to now) small things -- ending slut shaming, removing the stigmatization, and so on. Well, when you let the small things slide this is where it snowballs too. Now women can literally get a betabux after they hit the wall while whoring around with Chad at the same time. This is why the sexual revolution was the biggest mistake we ever made."
"What were the three things you loved the most when you were 6 years old? Can you study something related to that?

Not everyone can make it as an artist, but you can be an art therapist. "

"ethics and decency is right. an ideology for one group of people is wrong. ethics must remain implicit. if one makes it explicit, it is hypocrisy. 

the fixation on the idea that women must quickly reach 50% rates in male-dominated areas is merely an idea, not a necessary let alone good goal.

if you see modern society, everybody is studying until 27, then one wants to do many things, and at 36 one adorns oneself with one child. that is an unnatural and immature way to live one's life, and it destroys society. people are not aware that even their aims depend on situations which may not remain if they follow their aims. for instance, if one tries to steal from the rich, after a short while, one has very rich communist leaders and a starving population. similarly, too much ""liberalism"" leads to very illiberal situations. feminism leads to the destruction of society. always beware of those who have an idea how to make the world a better place. these people always create the problems."

"Tough to say without knowing how randomness was reduced, but it's possible the randomness was reduced by ""compartmentalizing"" the spread. This could easily result in overall loss of damage at certain ranges if the particular overlap of the compartments and the target isn't favourable. 

An easy way to picture this is by comparing this with TF2's 0%-random spread used in competitive. When you shoot 9 pellets, they always come out the same way; Draw a square around your reticle, there's 1 pellet in each corner, 1 in the middle of each side, and 1 dead center.

Now let's keep those 9 pellets per shot, for simplicity's sake. Imagine our reticle is a circle, and our target is also a circle; Let's say we're standing just far enough that the target is half the size of our reticle. If pellets are distributed randomly, we should hit 25% of our pellets (On average). If the pellets are fired like in TF2's competitive mode, with no randomness, only 1 (11.1111...%) will hit. 

Of course that effects depends on the actual compartmentalizing and shape of the target, along with range, but that's how it can decrease accuracy."

"I knew that YG was weaker among the Big 3 for album sales but I'm surprised they don't even make top 5 companies for Gaon sales. 

BTS is ludicrous at album sales. SM is really diversified in groups, makes them very stable. JYP and Pledis are what I imagine a more typical (large) Kpop company album sales look like, with a few big sellers making up most of the numbers. "
"I'm sure if you asked your boss ""Do you hate poor people?"" he would say ""Of course not!""  

The root of all this is the idea of personal responsibility: ""I take care of myself, I got a good-paying job, I pay my bills on time - why should I support people who don't take care of themselves?"" 

Unfortunately this whole ideology ignores the reality of what being a human is:  We cannot control the circumstances we are born into, we cannot control our natural abilities or disabilities and we cannot control the economic forces that are created a levels far above where we are.  Everyone wants to do better than they are but for a myriad of reasons many aren't able to.  

So in the end it's not a hatred of the poor (usually).  It's more a thought of ""Why can't the poor just do the same things I did to not be poor anymore?""

"Currently rocking a OnePlus 5t. The game runs smoothly, and I've never had any lag issues. I might switch to the 6T soon, but I'd expect the same level of performance if not better."
"I will go ahead and sound like the biggest scrub I can, but I believe that balancing the game around the small percentage of the best players is a mistake in the current state of the game. 

Dont get me wrong, If the game was much more balanced and had a competitive scene (or at least ambitions) I would find that to be the optimal method. But as of now, the game balance is whack and not only is the competitive scene not existent, the poor balance and aging design of the original classes actively prevents any competitive scene from happening.

With that said the devs should start by implementing fast changes that the majority of the gamers would appreciate and only after the general consensus is that the game is more or less balanced for ""us noobs"", they should start looking into making it truly balanced in the highest of levels.

I mean its great to know that HL's kick to caber is not a problem in the upper level of players (and I agree with that, I personally can counter it most of the times reliably with backward attacks), but the majority of players find it annoying and tedious to play against. This tells me that the best course of action is to either remove it, or make the transition much slower and more telegraphed. The upper level wont care much and the general playerbase will love that. Then buff something that is actually useful for all skill levels, like increasing the OS light damage from 10 to 12.

TL;DR: Balancing the game for the highest skill level players is a stupid idea when the game is unplayable in a competitive sense."

But on a serious note, the server available between the Stress Test and BETA so far has been way better than the launches I mentioned.
At this point it‚Äôs just speculation on my part, but I think actual launch night access should be relatively smooth.
A lot of people are getting salty about how Bethesda is going about this, and overlooking why they‚Äôre doing it, and what the benefit they‚Äôre amazing to accomplish is.
My assumption that it‚Äôs fueled by an innocent ignorance. Most pre-ordered the next Fallout game, not the next FPSMMO. So a lot of people have showed up single-player expectations on a multiplayer always online game. Bethesda realized what they aimed for, learned from whatever mistakes they made in launching ESO, and are trying to do it even better this time.
If I can log on at midnight (or whenever) Nov 14th and get into a server within 10 mins and the connection is stable, Bethesda absolutely blows away the other devs/publishers for how these games typically launch.
GTA V Online took a month to sort out.
The Division and Destiny would queue you up in a waiting list of 100s of thousands of players for an hour or two, you‚Äôd finally get into a near unplayable slog of lag for like 10-15 mins before getting dropped and sent back to the queue, over and over for hours until you just gave up.
Cheers to Bethesda potentially being one on the first major devs to actually launching a major always online game properly the first night, not the day after, or the day after that."

"I'd certainly say there's an astounding lack of education surrounding hidden disabilities and mental disorders in the school system in my country.

I don't think NTs really register that educating kids about things like depression, Autism, ADD/ADHD, OCD, and other hidden physical and mental disabilities would be beneficial or even lifesaving for individuals, who have it. 

They're barely coming to terms with the idea that sexuality (a widely known aspect of life that society is generally familiar with) and gender (a previously rigid concept in western culture) is a spectrum and should be taught in schools to normalize the idea of that, so why would a still relatively unrelatable and unpopular topic like Autism be brought up, when we're still this early on the more tangible things?

Until the day we, the actual people on the autistic spectrum, kick up as much of a fuss as other minorities, I doubt we'll see much of a change in terms of education on the topic for kids/teens and efforts towards the normalization of ASD in general. Society needs a kick in the pants, or it just lets status quo continue on as per usual, because NTs really don't like thinking outside of the box, when it comes to these things. They need actual motivation first.

What you're thinking of doing as a teacher is certainly a step in the right direction, at least, so kudos. Raise questions, and make your students think/empathize with people, who are different from them. It's a net positive for all of us, when people can think beyond their own experience."

SINGAPORE: The model of having social enterprises manage hawker centres on a not-for-profit basis was mooted with good intentions, but it will now have to be tweaked so that it benefits all parties involved, said local entrepreneur Elim Chew.

In particular, the issue of higher rents and additional fees faced by hawkers at some of these social enterprise-run hawker centres will have to be looked into, she told reporters on Wednesday (Oct 24).

""It (was recommended with) a good intention,‚Äù said Ms Chew. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a wrong model but it needs to be tweaked to a model that benefits all.‚Äù¬†

Ms Chew, best known as the founder of iconic streetwear brand 77th Street,¬†chaired the 18-member Hawker Centres Public Consultation Panel which in 2012 recommended the¬†not-for-profit hawker centre model.

The panel was formed in November 2011 after the Government announced in the¬†same year that it would start building more hawker centres amid concerns over rising¬†living costs.

Since the National Environment Agency (NEA) began appointing socially-conscious operators in 2015, there are now seven of such centres managed by five social enterprise entities ‚Äì Hawker Management by Koufu, Fei Siong Social Enterprise, NTUC Foodfare, Timbre+Hawkers and OTMH by Kopitiam.¬†

However, this operating model has¬†come under the spotlight following complaints about higher rents and additional fees for services¬†such as tray returns and cleaning.¬†

Last week, Senior Minister of State for Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor said that NEA will¬†do a ""[stocktake](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hawkers-centres-social-enterprise-model-issues-nea-amy-khor-10843652)"" of the model and bring errant operators to task.

Social enterprise operators have also been asked to form feedback groups in the hawker centres they manage, Dr Khor said in a Facebook post on Wednesday evening. The operators will meet the groups on a regular basis.¬†

""NEA will also actively engage these feedback groups to better understand ground issues, and facilitate timely responses,"" she added.  


**ISSUE OF WHO BEARS LOSSES**

Ms Chew said that while some of the complaints raised by hawkers have come as a surprise to her, they are also ‚Äúpart and parcel of who bears the loss‚Äù of running these hawker centres.

She added that there may have been some misunderstanding about the social enterprise model.

‚ÄúThey are not-for-profit but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt make profit,‚Äù she said, while stressing that profits will help to ensure the sustainability of these social enterprises.

‚ÄúAt the end of the day, it‚Äôs where the money goes to. In our recommendation, it‚Äôs a plough-back model ‚Ä¶ which means the money needs to go back to helping hawkers upgrade their skills or better programmes for the centres.‚Äù  


Ms Chew added that the question of who bears the losses of running these hawker centres will be one that authorities and operators have to look into. In addition, it may help to¬†get operators to declare how much profits will be put back into helping the hawkers.¬†

Under the panel‚Äôs proposed not-for-profit model, the hawker centres would be run by social enterprises ‚Äì defined as a regular business that maximises profits to deliver social impact ‚Äì with funding and other support from the Government.¬†

The priorities include ensuring that the community ‚Äúderive maximum benefit from the centre‚Äù, provide employment opportunities for individuals from the lower income groups and the less privileged, as well as help people who aspire to be part of the food industry.

When asked by Channel NewsAsia if this model is too idealistic given that these operators are businesses after all, Ms Chew replied: ‚ÄúThey are making money from the rest (of their operations) ‚Ä¶ so we‚Äôd think that maybe they would want to have a section that gives back. But even as much as they want to give back, they are coming with the angle that they cannot lose money ‚Äì it‚Äôs a very business mindset in terms of I cannot lose money.

‚Äú(Only when) we can help them to solve that then they will have the ease to say ‚ÄòOk, all these other things will be waived or absorbed‚Äô.‚Äù

It is an issue that needs to be clarified so that these do not get translated into additional costs for the hawkers, she added.

On how that clarification can be done, Ms Chew¬†suggested doing it through the tender contract between NEA and the operators, though she stressed that all parties involved¬†will have to come together to discuss how to make things work. 

Moving forward, Ms Chew thinks the model of having social enterprises manage hawker centres is still a viable one given that it was recommended as an alternative to NEA-run hawker centres with the aim of solving some problems, such as subletting of stalls¬†and having a more active landlord that can provide hawkers with help in areas like marketing.¬†

But current complaints¬†that have raised eyebrows about how social enterprises manage¬†hawker centres will have to be solved ‚Äì and be done soon.¬†

‚ÄúThe life of hawkers is¬†tough ‚Äì it is what we care for in the first place,¬†so we must do it as fast as we can.‚Äù¬†

"So, the school report and transcript are two different things. Your school report is from the counselor and has information about the demographics of your school (how many students, what sub groups your school has, how many AP classes they offer, stuff like that). Your transcript is your personal grades.

In my experience (I teach in a college readiness program called AVID), the fastest way to get a problem like this solved is to call the admissions office and talk to a person there.

""Hi, my name is Niladerp, and I am a high school senior who has applied for admission as a 2019 freshman. I was looking at my account on MyCarolina, and I am confused because it says my transcripts have not been received, but I thought mine had already been uploaded in CommonApp. Do you mind helping me check my file and make sure everything is there?""

Or something like that. All kinds of crazy stuff happens in getting all those files together. There are thousands of them and stuff gets mislabeled all the time.  The people there are really nice and will help you. 

It might be as simple as your counselor hasn't finished uploading your transcript yet."

I know what it's like to feel like someone is patronizing you or ignoring your feelings. I want to reiterate that was not my intent. I spoke from my own experience, having to come to the realization that my thoughts were irrational and that I needed to find a way to change how I think about things. I also had no ability to see that people cared about me or understand that some people cared but just had their own problems with showing it. I know my parents care about me, but they are very bad at showing it. I took me paying attention to how their own parents interact with them to understand what influenced their behaviors towards me.

If you're still pissed at me, I want to again say I'm sorry. I honestly didn't mean it the way it was taken.

"But your opponent couldn't win either. Would you even be against doing it CRL style where the person with the most damage on a single tower at the end of overtime wins? Also, it seems like you've never had this happen to you before. 

Imagine playing flawlessly the whole battle and completely outplaying your opponent. Your opponent has completely given up attacking by the time overtime starts. They have a couple of win conditions, but they know they can't break through. Despite them being in all defensive mode, by attacking perfectly you still manage to get damage onto their tower. They have no chance of winning. The only question is whether you'll be able to win in time or not. There is a minute left in overtime and their is only 200 hp left on their tower. Unfortunately, your only spells are BB and nado (btw this is my story lol and don't say it's my fault I didn't bring a damage spell cuz that's completely beside the point). You are throwing down everything you have but they are still barely managing to defend. Right when you are about to break through and they are extremely low on elixir and your battle ram is close to connecting to the tower and there is 5 seconds left in overtime, they barely block the battle ram with an inferno tower and all your troops kill it, but they stalled for just long enough for the time to run out right before your troops can demolish the tower. 

Imagine that. That is what happened to me. Maybe you can't predict how you would feel if this happened to you, but I can say with no doubt that you would feel very frustrated just like I did and you would agree with me about this issue. I deserved the win, at the least a redo, for well...WINNING the battle the whole time just not winning in the end. The opponent knew of course that he wouldn't get anything from forcing a draw because it would be the same as a loss, and yet he still didn't give me the win I OBVIOUSLY deserved. 

But WAIT, this comment is not to complain about my experience. It is just to try to give an example of why the concept of draws counting as losses in final battles can be so ANNOYING."

I remember one guy who accidentally took a 50mg naltrexone by accident and was in precipitated wd for over a day and couldn't break through.

The standard of being deemed a competent drug dog could just be shit in your state, where as a better dog (from the same state or trained elsewhere) very well might have caught you because it was trained to. Maybe that dog's trained (even unintentionally) to focus on large quantities of drugs for catching dealers, and isn't great at catching small-time users."

Being a glass cannon there are many situations, especially when your ult is down, you can't risk sticking around to finish the kill. This change will allow kayn to snowball _even when he cant finish kills._ Idk how often you play blue kayn, but there are COUNTLESS times i've invaded a jungler, burst them for ~80% of their hp, they dash/flash away and i can't risk chasing because of lack of vision/missing laners.

Also I lived on minimum wage for years, it isn't that hard.

Seriously if your food is going be ridiculously spicy, you should sign a waiver to protect yourself. **But also speak with a  lawyer who deals with restaurants to understand who other steps you need to take.** There may be a requirement such as you cannot let the customer leave the store until they seem reasonably okay.

The abortion question isn't exactly a measure of statistics (I'm actually pro-choice, btw); it's more of a question involving a logical answer. I to this day haven't gotten an answer to the question that doesn't involve either an insult or an ""I agree with you"" (I wanna know why they agree with me). But here's a statistic for you: only 2% of abortions actually involve incest/rape/health. Some sources below:

* [https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-worldwide-2017](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-worldwide-2017)

As far as the Democrats assuming that, it is not a measure of statistics, but of personal experience. I grew up in Houston, TX. I was taught that by my parents and teachers (and so were my classmates). I lost so many friends just for not agreeing after a while. I've been scolded and insulted by my parents and some former teachers just for trying to engage them. I have friendly discussions and exchanges of perspective with my remaining friends and former teachers whom I'm still in touch with, but those are moderate Liberals. Even when I was a Leftist, I've never been treated in such a manner by those on the Right. There are extremists on both sides--no doubt about it. But in my personal experience, I have yet to meet an alt-Right gun toting Bible thumper."

It's not better because it lets them continue their nuclear program, everything should be done to stop their nuclear program- it is silly to trust the ayatollah regime to believe they don't want to use nuclear technology for weapons, the policy should be that iran cannot have a nuclear program let alone have such a short horizon for easing of restrictions.

"&gt;I don't remember the NDP opposition to electoral reform, I thought they campaigned on it. Did they oppose ranked ballots in favour of MMP or otherwise? 

Yes. and then made a lot of noise about Trudeau ""breaking his promises""

&gt;Also, given the Liberals' majority in 2015, how can you suggest that NDP and conservative obstruction is responsible for Trudeau's broken electoral reform promise?

Because that would be seriously undemocratic! 1 party unilaterally changing the electoral system for a whole country against the opposition of 2 of the 3 parties; it would be an international scandal. On the practical side, it would set the precedent that any party in power could just change the system whenever they wanted.

Also, since Trudeau was very heavily into positive campaigning he never called the NDP out for their gaslighting bullshit.

"Not being known for crunch is kind of the point. I have much less of a problem with employees sometimes being tempted to stay late and get dinner, so long as nobody has a problem with people going home to see their family at 5. And if you really want to religiously work exactly 9-5 with no exceptions, it's not like you'd be giving up on any of those perks except dinner.

Having a ping-pong table as justification for working longer hours or accepting less pay is shitty. But if you're very well-paid, and work a *maximum* of 40 hours including the ping-pong, that sounds like kind of the opposite of these crunchy nightmares."

It‚Äôs true. She definitely could have changed her approach. But still 
"TL DR ""According to Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, the commitment to reforms is one of the big differences between France and Italy. While the government in France wants to go ahead and change certain areas, the executive in Rome has backtracked on key reforms that the previous government had implemented, including an overhaul to the pension system.

Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg, also told CNBC via email that at a first glance the French budget might be even worse than Italy's, but added that the big difference is the rhetoric coming from other countries.

""Taken at face value, the French budget plans do not look much better than the Italian's, or in fact worse. But, while France is credibly working on improving its long-run growth potential (by strengthening both the demand and supply side of the economy), Italy is doing the opposite (think a lower retirement age and fiscal spending channeled through to consumption rather than investment),"" he said."

You also admit that it is not fair as to the structure of the grouping of people into payouts. So you admit that we are all forced into a system that is inherently unfair to people in high population time zones. So why is it cheating for those people to cooperate, and not systemic cheating for the people in low density time zones?

I prefer the money income from towns; the cost of my personal demesne from my capital costs me 25 gold per month from a single maxed castle alone. And if you ever plan on switching to Chinese Imerialism, you'll be able to hold cities. I'm currently getting 3.5x more gold from a town than a castle in my capital county at the cost of about 40% less troops (and less quality though). But I think personal demesne in the late game is just there for a troop count factor to prevent rebellions."

To compile this you would have to configure your system to support program development work. And you would need to know a fair amount about compilation and configuration. And if you needed this to run on more than one computer, you would need to equip each computer similarly.

From the time I was young I felt like her caretaker, but never ever ever felt like she could provide me with the emotional support I was expected to give her.

"Freedom of speech is not unlimited, it's a civil right that does not extend to speech that willfully endangers citizens, in the same way the right to life doesn't give you the right to kill someone for their liver because yours is failing.  You can't scream fire in a crowded movie theater when you know there isn't a fire because people could be hurt in the ensuing panic.

Otherwise, if your parents are staying in a fancy hotel (like Armani, Bulgari, Four Seasons, Park Hyatt etc) and they don't mind paying a bit more, they can ask the concierge for tickets. It's probably going to be around 35/45 euros per person, instead of the usual 12 but, you know, it's still an option. 
The whole area of Santa Maria delle Grazie and Sant'Ambrogio is gorgeous and full of nice places to visit, though, so it's still very much worth a visit even without the tickets to the Last Supper.

My husband and I have had a few moments where I‚Äôll ask him to stay present and put his phone down. It‚Äôs only slightly blown up two times, but the end result was pretty much the same: you guys blew up, he took some time, and then he acknowledged he was being a jerk and apologized for it. In a perfect world, we would all communicate effectively and calmly 100% of the time, but we don‚Äôt. What matters is that there was an apology that wasn‚Äôt prompted, so that sounds like he was being very genuine.

Should you bring it up again? Eh, no. If it happens again, definitely address your feelings about it. But try to just lay low and let your anniversary week and trip be awesome. I‚Äôm not saying dust it under the rug, but I think it would be redundant at this point. If he‚Äôs never compared you to his ex before and it was just a heat of the moment crap reaction on his part, take his apology for what it is and hope it doesn‚Äôt happen again. If it does happen again, then yeah, that‚Äôs definitely where you put your foot down and go ‚Äúcomparing me to your ex is a boundary, and this is to never happen again. I don‚Äôt do this to you and demand the same treatment in return, no matter how upset you are right now.‚Äù

Happy anniversary. Try to be thankful you have a partner that heard you and owned up to his bad reaction and apologized. It‚Äôs okay to be frustrated, though.

"Yes, RBs are very safe picks. Their production generally carries over well to the pros and most of them are able to produce right away because the position doesn't face a steep learning curve like QB, WR or OL.

But the reward is also much lower for hitting on the pick. The Giants just drafted a guy that turned out to be a top 5 RB in the league from Week 1 and he did not move the needle. They are still a 3-13 team at best with a bottom 5 offense that's borderline unwatchable. And it's going to to continue to be this way until they fix their QB and OL situations.

Meanwhile, hitting on a franchise QB in the draft gives you the backbone for a contender for the next 10 years. 

Darnold is nowhere near as good as Barkley, but I'd much rather have Darnold if I was a bad team, because if Darnold turns out to be a top 10 QB in a year or 2 then you can build a SB team around him, while Barkley could be the next Barry Sanders and it won't matter without a QB."

"I hear what you are saying and I understand. There are many out there shouting doom and gloom and consistently forget that everything is in a constant state of balance and rework.  

My personal opinion which is subject to change is that PTU ship prices are terribly unbalanced for PTU mission payouts.  Actual ship prices for actual missions probably wont be.  A typical PTU mission is either 460, 500, 960, or 1080 credits per PTU mission. At the maximum of 1000 credits for a PTU mission it would require 1500 successful PTU missions to purchase a PTU Cutlass assuming no money was spent on fuel or other supplies. Giving a short estimate at 15 minutes per PTU mission that would be 750 hours of game time.  

Of course the end game will probably change; I realise there is a lot of feedback but dismissing the opinions of the testers doesnt help development even if they all just keep repeating themselves."

Your ideas are limiting and it's not that men lack a good strong male example, it's that your idea of what a strong man is is no longer what the mainstream idea of a strong man is and the same way before some men who were not aggressive and dominant were just left out of the narrative and told that their qualities were inferior (along with the women they supposedly had them in common with) and now it's reversed. Aggressive men who want to take the lead have to earn that and show that they are in full control of their aggression. Men who want to lead don't just get to now. They have to be worth following.   


And THAT is something men were not prepared for. If the male role is to lead, what about those of you who aren't leaders? Those of you without any real leadership qualities but who are ""alpha"" in that you don't have submissive traits and have aggression and chafe under other people's leadership?  


Yall got left out now. Feminism and dating are far more focused on identifying dangers and minimizing or eliminating them (like men have been telling women to do forever) except men like you didn't expect women to make their own decisions about what a man they don't want is.   


Ultimately you can be as angry as you want about it but women having a say has changed social dynamics and it's not going back because what used to be was good for a small minority of men and objectively bad for most everyone else. "

As for the fanfiction...you're entitled to your own opinion, obviously. I have read amazing works from all sorts of my favorite fandoms in my life from Harry Potter to Game of Thrones to Batman from very competent writers that feel as though their work could easily be canon. Not everyone that has talent to write has talent to build their own original characters and worlds, and even those that can sometimes just find pleasure in immersing themselves in a world that they love. Is every fanfic a masterpiece? No. Not every fic is even intended to be taken seriously (I recently read an absolutely hilarious short in which Hannibal believed that ducks could read his mind), but I will always appreciate the facts that these authors/creators allow us to play in their worlds.

"When I was around 12 I had to move from US to Korea due to my parents being dispatched at there. I still remember my teacher Ms. Lim or something, she was an English teacher. There was this one time she pronounced a word wrong and I corrected her, and after that day she didn't really like me. None of the kids liked me also because most of them were from a worker class family and me being kinda like a well off family who lived in US for a long time.

Fast forward 2 months later one kid called me out to the bathroom without any reason and started to punch me in the face. Zero reason. Even to this day I still don't know why he did that, because I never went close to him or talk to him because he was one of those bullies you don't want to associate with. Eventually we got called out and had to confront with the teacher. The teacher, without even asking the bully, shouted at me saying 'what have you done this time boy?' and scolded me for 'making disturbance inside the school'. I was baffled, so angry but I got hit hard on the head so I couldn't think straight at the same time, so I took my silence.

After when I got beaten and went home, my parents freaked out from the barbaric actions the kid has done and called the teacher to find out what happened. She didn't reply but only said 'he did the right thing, shakejfran pissed him off I guess?'. My parents, after hearing this, got so angry and decided to take full action to find out the truth.

Thankfully some of the kids stood up for me from this fucked up situation and his parents and him came to our house and apologized, but obviously he looked more angry about his situation than apologetic about beating the daylights out of me for no reason.

Ironically though, if Ms. Lim didn't try to cover his sorry ass we wouldn't have called the local law enforcement to sort things out. Things would've been smooth if she just didn't have to be a bitch to me. And of course, she didn't get any penalties and got out free, while I got accused by her misjudgment.

After this incident my parents applied jobs in US and we eventually moved back."

"To start with I would do as much as possible to disguise that fact that I won the lottery. I would claim in anonymously or via a trust if at all possible. I would not take pictures with a big check unless I had to to claim the prize and if I had to I would do my best to physically disguise myself.

 

Take the lump sum assuming a 39% tax rate that is roughly 549 million after taxes. I would set up a 5 million dollar trust for my brother and another $5 million dollar trust for my parents. I would invest this and set myself up to live off .5% of the principal or the same amount as the previous year whichever was larger. This would be about 2.7 million per year that I would pay out to myself bi-weekly.

 

Of that I would allocate 50% to either charitable causes or lobbying.

 

I would retire from work at the end of November and take up circus training full time.

 

I replace my current car with a Mercedes E 63 AMG wagon, that I would remove the AMG badging from.

 

I'd go and get a professional to help me with my wardrobe

 

I'd hire a housekeeper

 

I would set up a small educational trust for one of my friends who came from a very rough background.

 

I would continue living where I do for the moment although I might offer to remodel my bathroom and some of the backyard for my landlord (who is a good friend of mine). I have been a homeowner in the past and I am honestly much happier right now renting a room from a friend then I was when I owned a house even though I had more space.

 

Overall I would prefer to present an appearance where I slowly get nicer stuff over the course of a few years as opposed to going out right off the bat and buying a whole bunch of exotic cars. Also, while I would be generous I'm also wary of giving a lot of high value items especially quickly. I think you have to be a little careful so that you don't get surrounded by sycophants. When I do gift things I would prefer only I and the receiver are aware of it.

Ponte pants are smart-looking black fabric that have STRETCH, which makes your life much comfier.  The Crossroads ones look smart but have an elastic waist, and they're dead comfortable.  Buy multiple pairs.  You can buy black and grey if you want, I just wear all black all the time.  
* Tops.  Sadly, as a female, people *do* notice if you wear the same thing all the time.  I wouldn't recommend getting a week's worth of identical tops.  
Blouses are **not** required - I am busty and detest trying to find collared shirts that fit.  You can't wear tshirts in most professional environments, but you *can* wear shell tops, tunics, and so on made of nicer fabrics.  
I like Max and Crossroads for mine.   Sometimes the odd nice top will turn up at Kmart or Warehouse etc.  If you buy them in patterns, no-one will ever notice that you're wearing the same pants all week.  
* Blazers, jackets, cardigans.  This will depend on your workplace, and you'll only know what's acceptable once you get there! I hate blazers so I don't wear blazers any more. I wear waterfall cardigans round the office, in winter I sometimes wear nice knit sweaters... 
* Shoes will depend on the workplace. (ie: look at what your colleagues are wearing the first couple weeks, then buy another pair of shoes that fit in with that.) It's worth having at least one pair of smart looking shoes with a low heel (like the ones u/ring_ring_kaching linked).  I do wear heels, but that's because I like heels.  If I don't want to wear heels, I wear [nice] ballet flats.  "

"I felt this way about my first boyfriend. we were high school sweethearts, together for two and a half years, and both virgins that entire time. I always thought that if I ever was with another man who had more sexual experience with me, I would feel inadequate about myself. but, my boyfriend and I broke up, and I started to have different partners, and I never really thought about it again. 

I always told myself that this person I'm with is actively choosing to be with me, just like I'm choosing to be with them. if they didn't want to be with me sexually, they wouldn't. it's the same way with your gf. she chose not to be with that guy, and she chooses to be with you because she has feelings for you.

"Did your doc do a blood draw before giving it to you? I've been on it for 4 years now and it's been great however my doctors have typically done a blood draw each year with the renewal to check the potassium levels. If they didn't , you might request one so you can see where you currently are at to know if you need to adjust your diet or if you are at a good level already.

As far as side affects for being too high, I have no idea on that one.

For using it for life, I think that may vary. It's probably never ideal to be on meds long term if you don't need to. Personally I did try to ween off it and my face stayed clear but my back did not (which was my original concern when I got on it). So I'm back to taking it. However everyone is different.

"As someone who gained a lot of weight in my 30's, and then lost it all before I turned 40, here's my opinion:

- I knew I was overweight. I thought it was impossible for me to lose weight, I was cursed etc. People suggesting I needed to lose weight would piss me off.

- In my 30's I did a lot of emotional work on myself. Turns out my over eating was mostly a way to stuff down emotions. I always ate a lot, but in my 30's I became far less active and so that caused the weight to pile on.

- I went to work at a company where all of my co-workers were doing weight watchers. They asked if I wanted to join and I thought, sure I could lose a few pounds. Was in shock when I stepped on that scale for the first time. How did I get so heavy? Followed the program and saw I was quickly dropping the weight. Ended up losing more than all of my co-workers. 50 pounds.

So...no one could tell me or get me to lose weight until I was ready to do it for myself. I also needed to deal with my emotional stuff which led to emotional eating as well. I think it makes sense to try to plan more active things with your wife, like walks or bicycle rides. Does she do all the cooking? Maybe you can take some healthy cooking classes and offer to make dinner now and then? Doing things that will be helpful and help her to change some of her habits might be a way to cause a spark in her.

"&gt; Virtually everyone from a lower working class family (UK) will know someone who owns their own home and is therefore worth 100k net at least. I knew a bunch of people in that category as a teen and not one of them made any contribution to my education or assisted me in any way. That's a dumb standard to eliminate by. That's most of the population you are eliminating.

If I recall, as per your first comment, we're talking about US mi/billionaires specifically. And in the US, there are many areas, entire neighborhoods even, where no one owns their own home. But, even so, perhaps friendship is too stringent a metric. As you say, just because you know someone with some money, doesn't mean they will give you gifts or monetary or social assistance in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Actually the school makes very little difference to educational outcomes once you correct for things like the intelligence, behaviour of the child and family disruptions. You don't just get your childhood environment from your parents you get genes. The actual teaching standard makes a minor difference at best.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its very much put about by the left that kids going to poor schools get bad results because of the school, but the truth is poverty has a large genetic component and kids going to school in poor areas are less genetically fortunate and not so good as students.

Let me get this straight; you are claiming that poor people are poor because they are *genetically destined* to achieve less in life? That those with a lifetime higher income potential, those families with wealth, are *genetically blessed*? Intellectually superior, even?

So, by extension, and given the fact that nearly a quarter of all black people in the US are impoverished, compared to less than a tenth of all white people, are you claiming that black people are *genetically* less intellectually capable than white people?

I'm not sure what kind of elitist train of thought you're following, but any scientist worth their salt would decry your massive leap in logic here. 

 

&gt;*Grammar schools have virtually no effect because genetics determine academic success, a King‚Äôs College London (KCL) study has found. Researchers examined the genetic differences between students who attend selective and non-selective schools, then analysed their GCSE results. They found that children who attend grammar or private schools are more likely to do well in exams - but this is largely down to their genes, rather than their school environment. They found that children who attend grammar or private schools are more likely to do well in exams - but this is largely down to their genes, rather than their school environment.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Emily Smith-Woolley, the lead author of the paper, said: ‚ÄúOur study suggests that for educational achievement there appears to be little added benefit from attending selective schools. While schools are crucial for academic achievement, the type of school appears less so.‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-018-0019-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-018-0019-8)

Frankly, I disagree with many of the conclusions miss Smith-Woolley has drawn here, or at least, for her rather unfounded explanations of those conclusions. Like you, she has committed the mistake of conflating correlation with causation. 

What her study concluded was that there was, in the set of students studied, a certain common set of genetic factors shared between those students who performed better. Regardless of academic institution. 

Her explanation for this that schools select for students with higher cognitive ability, or for students with parents of higher cognitive ability, as determined by wealth.

But she presents no evidence upon which to base this explanation. She found only that they had the genes in common, and that their measured performance in tests of cognitive ability was higher. But cognitive ability is determined by environment, as well as genetics. Instances of disease, malnutrition, and poor pre-natal health, which are all correlated with *and* caused by poverty, are also proven causes of decreased cognitive ability.

On the other hand, genetic similarity of a hand-selected group can be caused by a number of things, including, most notably, actual ancestral relationship.

And so here's a fun fact for the UK, a country which George Orwell labelled in 1941, ""The most class-ridden society under the sun."" [Family wealth has barely budged since the Victorian era](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecoj.12165). If your ancestors in Britain were wealthy in the 1800's, they are still wealthy now, and vice versa.

And, given that a person in any country is far more likely than not to start a family with someone of the same level of wealth as them, it should be no surprise that all the families of a given social class (such as the class that can afford to send it's children to private school) are more likely to be related to each other than to the families of a different social class. Even if they are far distant cousins, they will still have more genes in common, which would explain miss Smith-Woolley's findings.

&amp;#x200B;

Is that the absolute, guaranteed truth? The proven cause of this correlation? No, not necessarily. But it is every bit as reasonable as her assumption. And unlike her, I make no wild claims of my certain correctness.

&amp;#x200B;

So, frankly, I reject your line of reasoning here, and stand by my original statement. If a person comes from a family that can afford to send them to a private school, I do not consider them ""self-made""."

"Attack speed in general is a large part of the meta right now.

"This is correct.

The ALP did engage in some historical gerrymandering too if I recall.

Nevertheless there was one federal election in the 1950s in which over 50% of people voted for the ALP, but they still ended up the minority party in parliament.

Queensland particularly has a very poor record of skewed elections and not just because of Bjeke-Peterson. Qld state elections often end up with a disproportionate seat imbalance, and this has happened a few times since the Jo years, with both major parties benefiting at one time or another. The worst one was 2012: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2012_Election_Queensland_Gallagher_Index.png"

"I think the area in Groom Lake and more specifically the large water puddle opposite of the Project Skadi Winter's Howl box spawn is part of the easter egg in some way but likely not the first step given how long it takes to reach that area. I think that if we are able to find the source of the bullet shell dropping sound that will give us a clue to keep moving some how.   


My own tin foil hat theory is that there is a false wall on the office floor behind the red telephone. From theater mode I can see that there is a room/hallway behind it and no zombies seem to spawn from that area. But it is just as likely a painting with an incorrect sign or something outside of the map.    


Something to note in case you also have looked around in Theater, the digits seen on each of the Project Skadi pictures are not visible. So even if we are looking in the right spot in theater we may not see anything in game. "

"I totally agree with you. And I respect opinions thqt call for shut-downs of brothels if they are guided by reason.

Yes, I wouldn't hire a prostitute, but that personal dislike would not lead to me being against the legalization. Too many people operate under that idea, which is why I defend legalization rather strongly. But right now I think it is a rather open debate. We may both be wrong or right, the verdict is not out yet.

As for using drugs and frequenting a brothel, I think the issues are quite comparable. Yes, a human does not grow up with being used to drugs the same way he has an urge to have sex. But he has an urge to feel good and happy. You can feel happy by doing something you like, just as you can have sex by being in a relationship. Drugs and prostitution are just a shortcut to these urges, which is why even the harshest prohibitions never ended usage and just empowered criminals. 

I just don't think these urges are bad in itself. As long as there is enough education and help for those who get entrapped by them, it is just natural and will never be rooted out by tighter laws."

You can check the strength decrease of Laurel Hubbard who lost like 50+ kg off her total, going from international level male competition to international level female competition. She used to be able to exceed the woman's world records and now she's not even close. She won a national competition as a woman (with a total over 50kg less than the last olympic gold medalist), and had set national records as a man. So elite level to elite level, not being at the top of either. 

i'm suggesting in terms of athletic performance changes testosterone blockers and estrogen change what's relevant. Hell HRT makes your feet shrink and typically people lose a couple inches height.

Since transgender athletes can actually compete now we'll get some hard data from elite levels, but nothing at non-elite levels has shown an advantage, and the fact it's been 14 years since they could compete in the olympics and none have won any medals suggests they aren't able to dominate the top levels of sport either."

"&gt; So, there are then less deposits - less money in the real economy.

But if money is disappearing doesn't the central bank ultimately step in and  repo bonds so as to keep ~~interest rates~~ inflation constant? 

I'm still confused on this topic, but it looks to me the obsession with bank deposits is misguided. If commercial banks didn't exist the process would still occur. Lenders would lend money, trading one type of financial asset (money) for another (an IOU), which is easily tradeable for money.
The central bank effectively ensures an equilibrium between money and other financial assets so this trade doesn't ultimately change anything from the perspective of the financial institutions. 

The exchange also balances out from the perspective of the borrower, they now have a liability and an asset. But they spend the asset first. Only in the long-run do the two balance out, when net debt is growing it means it's not balancing out in the short-run. 

So that explains why debt drives the economy. 'Spending power' (i.e. what generates effective demand) is not transferred from lender to borrower as in the classical case, nor is it created out of thin air which seems to be a standard MMT interpretation. Rather it comes from the borrower shifting his spending power from his future self to his present self. "

"Yep. There's a similar mindset between people who think they're great parents or dog owners but really aren't.

There's always tons of second chances and empty threats/punishments because it's never about raising/training a kid/dog to act appropriately, it's about keeping them happy so that you can go to bed feeling satisfied yourself.

"Worst i had was in the last 30 minutes I made it to Grafton and an event where I had to stop a protest started. Went to the area it was telling me. A bunch of super mutants spawn in and I start unloading my 10mm into the group as I backpedal out of the alley we are in. As I empty the clip I quick switch to my hunting rifle and drop 3 of them quickly. As i reload my rifle a skrimisher rounded the corner and started firing his auto rifle. At this point I noticed one of the bodies I killed earlier hadnt dropped to the ground. I also couldnt loot any of them. Luckly for me someone had showed up and helped me finish the last of the ground forces and after I couldnt loot their corpse I went finished off the few on the roof. I heard more voices in the building nearby and found two more mutants, and one was even have stuck in the wall. He pressed on and even attacked me but he was at like a 45 degree angle floating of the ground. After killing them and securing the area. I realized the event hadnt proceded and there was no way to continue the event. Saw a few T posing ghouls that werent actually there too. But the event was the worst. "

"Atheism is to find the truth while the believer believes blindly in that inscrutable entity and when there are no proofs that those inscrutable entities exist in modern times, hence atheism but everyone believes in something, in themselves or an exterior source, God is not necessarily a icon worshiped in an religious sect, Eminem is the God Of Rap, I believe in his raps, Freddie Mercury is greater than God, I believe he is better than 95% of the artists to ever exist or to exist in the future. Atheism is not the opposite of Believing it is more about pursuing the truths about the existence of God and questioning their existence which now has grown more into hatred for Gods. We're in a modern society and we are men of science and we tend to believe that has some concrete evidence backing up their existence and no such scientific experiment has been deviced  to explain the omnipotent existence of those entities so like the Schrodinger cat , it either exists or it doesn't but atheists are the guys who live in grey needing more evidence."

As for finding a hobby/passion I used to be a person with no passions, I did a lot of things, I played on multiple sport teams, played piano, played video games and board games, ran around and did whatever with friends but nothing did it for me. I liked these things, but if they left my life permanently the next day I don‚Äôt think I would care all too much. But then after years of searching you eventually find a thing or two. I found rock climbing first, I know for a fact I could not live with out it, and because of that I found my wife, and my wife I can do anything and nothing with, I am almost convinced I could do without rock climbing as long as I had her.....maybe.

"Well itll be stale in the same way smash ville is getting stale. It's not that itll be played a lot but that itll practically be played every single game 1. Battlefield has never been played that often. 

And if you choose a stage that benefits your opponent that's just bad stage picking. Personally I'd only pick stages that I'm pretty certain benefit my character more than theirs. if I'm against a rosa player I'm not going to toss in town and city or another low ceiling level and give him a freebie.

Generally people are going to pick stages they think give them the best chance to win, so why pick something that helps your opponent? Optimal strategy almost every time would be to remove your opponents stages and play on battlefield. To the point where I could see people just starting up on battlefield and ignoring the whole process until round 2. Also bf isnt entirely neutral theres a lot of characters that are good/bad on it that would get a massive boost/hindrance from playing it most game 1s. Stuff like mac playing every game 1 on battlefield would make him much less viable in general, and the reverse is true for cloud. 

I'm not trying to hate on your idea I think it could be great with a little work. But I dont see many good players choosing their opponents stage. Its basically saying ""I know you have an advantage here but let's try it"". I think your idea of adding a few other neutral stages in the first round would really help solve the problem. "

None of the people I've ever heard talk about it had a position that had anything to do with them at all, only with preventing others from various things.  

I don't think that government needs to be smaller for the sake of being smaller, but I do think that there are inefficiencies that can be addressed.  I don't think that government should interfere with personal liberties, but I do think that food, drugs, and other products should be inspected and held to standards for safety, effectiveness, and accurate labeling. I don't think that government should be giving jobs to unqualified people or giving unlimited cash assistance to people without disabilities (which they don't anyways as there is a lifetime limit for that,) but I do think that they should be helping people achieve their goals by ensuring fair education, hiring, and wage practices through regulations."

The good news is that if she is in treatment, then her health is being monitored very closely. It serves you no good to constantly be worrying. Her provider will take care of that and she will be sent right out to the hospital if there‚Äôs any signs of serious medical distress. But I know it is so hard to see someone you love hurting themselves and suffering so deeply. You sound like an empath. When others hurt, you hurt too. 

You said she doesn‚Äôt talk about it much. Secrecy and shame are difficult barriers to overcome with eating disorders‚Äîbut it‚Äôs super important in recovery. It would be great to remind her that you would never judge her, and  hopefully you can have a really open discourse with her. It can be so embarrassing to talk about but it could help you both a lot. EDs are NOT a death sentence by any means.

You sound like you are doing all you can do. And I‚Äôm happy to hear that your friend has a treatment team in place. Take care of yourself and I‚Äôm sending lots of recovery vibes to your friend whoever she is!!!

"Oh ho ho ho....now THIS I can comment on.  


Yea....I and my wife have noticed some short term memory loss on my part.   I've always been an avid reader/autodidact and I'm finding it harder to learn new complex things.     Funny thing is, I'm pretty much a triva master.  I watch Jeopardy most nights eating dinner and answer about 90% of the questions correct.  


I talked to my doctor, and got a referral to a neuro to be sure it's not something serious, but she told me it was likely nothing.  She also said that short term memory is lost (except for physical trauma) by things interfering with the process that ""sweeps"" short term memories (the literally bajillion of the things we sense every day) into the longer term memory.  This generally happens during sleep.   So here' s what changes that process.  See if you recognize a few things!  


* Lack of REM sleep.  Can be caused by medical/physical things, especially apnea.  Can also be caused by physical injury/pain.
* Stress, especially prolonged stress that never subsides.   Stressful job?  Tough parenting?   Relationship problems?
* Alcohol use, especially to the level where you feel ""buzzed"" or greater.
* Lack of exercise.  This ties in with the stress and sleep. Exercise has some mechanisms that cause the body to heal from stress, remove stress hormones, etc.   Helps with circulation, which is key to brain function.  


Anybody recognize any of those from your life?  I actually laughed out loud when she said them to me (I have them all)."

"Since im procrastinating I decided to crunch some numbers:

the NZ average hourly rate for people aged 25 (average age of womens cricketers) is $25 per hour (statsnz)

A t20 goes for 4 hours, so $100 per person

x 12 (team plus 12th man) = $1200 per team

x 2 for the other team is $2400 per game.

There are 32 games in the Super Smash comp for women (including finals). 

so $2400x32= $76800

So for an entire tournament, to pay these female cricketers the mean wage for the 4 hours that a game takes to play, it would cost NZ Cricket $76800, and each player can earn a maximum of $1100 provided they play every game including the finals.

This is still $475 less per game than the comparative mens players would earn per game, but at least give them some money for their efforts.

This of course doesn't include the time spent training, travelling, and supplements that are required as a professional sportsperson that is expected to preform to a professional level....

"So out of that $6.15, $1.01 is the federal excise tax. $0.45 is the NC excise tax. They are also covered by sales tax, so if we assume the max rate of 7.5%, you're looking at an additional $0.33 in taxes. So, in total, that pack of cigarettes only costs $1.78 in taxes.

Given the estimated cost of making a pack of cigarettes is around $0.06, nah, Philip Morris is still making money hand over fist on a pack of cigarettes. There'd have to be a mark up of about 240% on a pack of cigarettes for Philip Morris to be making less on a pack of cigarettes than the federal and state governments."

"Take it with a grain of salt.  This was said by an eye witness inside the Kroger during a live interview. I've been watching all day (am local to the area) and I haven't seen his interview aired again. He could have said it but it also could have been made up for shock factor by one individual on TV.

Edit: I guess we will get clarification once they identify the two people murdered.  I would find it hard to believe he said this if one of them turns out to be white. Although it is possible he said it to save his own ass when he found himself on the other side of a barrel.

Edit 2: Looks like my grain of salt hope was wrong. Motive has not been officially released but unfortunately it is being suspected as a hate crime. 2 black individuals (69 and 67) were gunned down at random by a white man (51). I feel bad for the families.

Edit 3: Also it has come to light that 10 minutes before the shooting at Kroger he tried to enter a Baptist Church. Security footage showed him try and enter three different locked doors. The thought is his original plan was to shoot up the church but nobody can know for sure. This was truly a fucked up individual."

It had an amazing style or visual appeal or whatever you want to call it, but the story (beyond the main premise) was convoluted and nonsensical. The dialogue was crap. The effects, the costumes, the sets and the style were all amazing, but there was no writing or dialogue to make any of it matter."

You're giving people an excuse to disrespect women's looks, which is baffling. When women see an attractive man walk on the street with skin-tight underarmor or a nice suit (lingerie to our eyes), we don't catcall or disrespect them.

"1. Without GCM or APNS how will you be able to show notifications on the OS level on Android or iOS? Scheduling local notifications from the messages sent by the MQTT broker?

If you are using MQTT the clients will only be able to receive messages as long as the TCP socket connection is opened. My assumption is that this socket would be running on a [background service](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background), but there are limitations to those. Falling back to long polling won't work either because then the App would need to be running in the foreground or on a background service too.

I guess the only feasible implementation would be to store a delta of the last message received and then for the client to fetch all missing messages since the last time it was synchronised. 

But then the solution won't be real time and it kind of defeats the purpose of what you are out to build.

Also battery consumption of running a TCP socket 24/7 is something you might want to look into.

Replacing a fully working notification system is not the easiest of tasks. I admire your commitment though."

"Side question for this, would you drop LVE for Taylor?"
"&gt; And no, Batman does not kill the Joker. Alan Moore‚Äôs statements, the script, the story‚Äôs canonocity, and Joker‚Äôs later appearances and references all prove that.

You act as though Moore is the only one to get any say in the matter, though, but he is not the only author the book. Yes he is the writer, but he has shared authorship with Brian Bolland, who has something else to say entirely about the matter. I'll elaborate, with the afterword writing by Bolland himself, at the end of the 2008 Deluxe edition:

&gt; It was me that asked Alan to write the book and not the other way around. The Killing Joke was not a project instigated by Alan, nor was it, as far as I know, a labor of love for him, and it doesn't usually appear in a list of his greatest works. I was glad he agreed to write it though.

Bolland even goes on to suggest his frustration in Moore's insistence on some events within the books, 

&gt; The script of The Killing Joke was very good, but I must admit I had to grit my teeth a couple of times during the drawing of it. I, for instance, would never have chosen to reveal a Joker origin. ... Also, I wouldn't have done such terrible harm to Barbara.

It can then be seen that Bolland initiated the story, and thus had his own ideas for it that he did get to implement in the art, where the visuals can also be taken as literal text to interpret, as well as Bolland not totally agreeing with everything Moore has in mind for the text. Bolland goes on to further muddy these waters, by acknowledging the ambiguity of the ending:

&gt; People seemed to find the last page of the story ambiguous ... Speaking of which, it's time I revealed what really happened at the end of the Killing Joke: as our protagonists stood there in the rain laughing at the final joke, the police lights reflecting in the pools of filthy water underfoot, the Batman's hand reached out and ...

Bolland intentionally trails off in his afterword, though it's obvious that he, as an author of The Killing Joke, at least approves of their being multiple interpretations of this ending, and hence leaves room for multiple interpretations. It's not just a theory of Morrison's or the fans, the artist and instigator of the story acknowledges the dual interpretation that the ending can hold. He even perhaps leans more heavily on the idea of Batman killing Joker, what with him describe this as ""**the final joke**"".

And speaking of the merit of interpreting the artwork as literal text, the Batman *does* place his hands awfully high on Joker. They both laugh, you can see this in the sound affect lettering. Also seen in the lettering is the approaching sound of the Batmobile. Part of the merit of this Batman killing Joker interpretation is that the laugh is cut off abruptly, whilst the sound of the car approaching still continues. If Joker was still alive, he would still be laughing, which would be seen along with the car approaching. Bolland, an author in this text, had active involvement in generating this interpretation, *within the text itself*, so I don't think you should rule it out all too readily based on something Alan Moore said, though being an equal part creator of this text, saying what he did *outside* the text itself, so less so factoring in as equal merit of interpretation."

"Well thank you :)  I'm glad you liked it!  I'm so pleased to see the gradual changes in the gaming community, moving away from toxic masculinity and beginning to slowly embrace things like non-traditional men or complex women.  Gaming is something I love, but it lags behind other geek sub-cultures in terms of expressing different lives and experiences.

For how inventive games can be with mechanics and worlds, we still seem to go for the same generic Game Man Protagonist and his Mysterious Love Interest Girl Who Has A Past over and over again.  In recent years, with the influx of more diverse voices in the gaming community, I really think we're starting to grow and expand, and it's great to see.

I also think Varian is great for the WoW community in general because...well, there's a lot of guys on here now who're dads.  Guys who started playing WoW fifteen years ago and are still playing it today, but they're not high schoolers anymore.  They're married, and have a job, and kids.  And men very rarely get expressions of fatherhood as anything other than in relation to violence -- Good Fathers in movies and games get to do two things: beat up the people threatening his kids/wife, or beat up the people who killed his kids/wife.  Fathers can protect, or they can avenge.

But I think most fathers on this subreddit know that there's a lot more to it.  They change diapers, they tuck in, they sing songs and read books.  They're nurturing their children and trying to enrich their lives in much more complex ways than just ""Well, if someone threatens or kills you, I'll beat them up.""

And those same dads are going to experience things like ""My kid really likes this thing that I don't like"" or ""My kid's new interest is way outside my wheelhouse and I don't know how to deal with it.""  And as a father, they try to grow and adjust themselves.  They have to figure out the best way to engage with their son or daughter, to form those emotional connections that mean so much to both parent and child.

Having Varian have to learn to control his anger, to listen to his son and learn to appreciate that his son is never going to be like him, and that's okay, because just because you're different from your dad doesn't mean that one is better or worse.  It's just different, and that adds to the richness of your family.  It shows a father being nurturing, being thoughtful, being more than just an ultra-masculine machine who can only express his love through violence.  

That's rare enough in film.  In games, I honestly can't think of another example.  Almost every game that deals with fatherhood is...about protecting or avenging.  I'm sure there's a few examples of something different, but I still can't think of anything like Varian's story.

This is rambly, sorry.  It's just a topic that interests me and it makes me excited to see new expressions of masculinity in games -- that portrays men as emotionally complex and expressive, and not just taciturn grief machines with bulging biceps.

(And there's still the bulging biceps, because WoW is still trying to conquer the idea of men *not* having rippling walls of muscle, but I believe that one day we'll have an adult model of Anduin where he actually looks like a priest and not a dude who does sick reps)"

"This actually seems to be the case (supported by the Codex excerpt): I haven't thought about this before and just assumed it was kerosine on steroids (and the [wiki article](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Promethium) didn't falsify that), which seemed to be supported by it being described as similar to napalm when used for weapons while also being viable as resource for the equivalent to oil-based product (plastics etc.).

"&gt;Why is every one of your posts about pitbulls? That's a weird obsession.

Not even remotely true: I post frequently about other dog and animal issues (as well as stuff that's not remotely animal-related) on this account. I'm certainly not ""obsessed,"" but I do know a lot about this issue.

Why do I post *frequently* about pit bulls?

1: I think this is a fascinating and complex issue, and I've spent years researching it.

2: As a longtime animal shelter professional, I see the fallout from the ""pit bull equality"" movement every day, and it's quite honestly been disastrous for pit bulls: prior to [the pit bull lobby's multimillion-dollar rebranding campaigns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFa8HOdegZA), pit bulls were not common in shelters and dogfighting was on the way out. Now, U.S. shelters kill an estimated 800,000 unwanted pit bulls annually. [I wrote more in depth about this here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/8eggva/discussion_is_popularization_of_a_breed_from/dxv6k2t/)

3: There's a lot of misinformation, not to mention deliberate disinformation, on this topic and people appreciate having the facts. I also take issue with [the tobacco industry lobbying tactics now being used by the pit bull lobby, which I wrote more in depth about here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BanPitBulls/comments/9fs5it/a_plea_for_empathy_from_a_regular_poster_in_this/e5zcbd2/)

4: Pit bull apologists are pretty well-known for harassing people who say anything remotely ""negative"" about pit bulls (even when it's true) to the extent that someone even made a parody called [How to Survive a Pit Bull Owner Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ6HvjJisMA). They harass journalists, victims, and have even [blockaded a dog attack memorial:](http://www.ohmidog.com/2014/10/06/is-artwork-an-attack-on-pit-bulls/)

On Reddit, for example, one of the moderators of a very popular sub has been banning people who make ""anti-pit bull"" posts on other subs, even if they've never done so in the sub he/she moderates. As someone who tries to follow the rules of every sub I post in, I think that's pretty slimy, so I want to limit that kind of petty bullshit to this account so I can still use my other account to post everywhere on Reddit.

Obligatory ""*not all pit bull owners*,"" but yeah, that last one is why I maintain a *separate* account for pit bull posts."
"I think it'd be partial autonomy in the Palestinian areas much like is the case currently, the only difference would be that this wouldn't be such a source of political strife and resentment as these people would also have full self-determination and autonomy in a Palestinian State, which would mean a military and national pride etc.

What a Palestinian state would become would be up to the Palestinians really wouldn't it? If they want to live under Hamas that's their choice, but the world couldn't really justify Hamas violence any more (one hopes).

"I've had time to think about it.

I think there are two things Catalyst is trying to do here:

**Motive/Goal #1:** He's trying to outsmart you and indoctrinate you similar to how the Illusive Man and Saren were indoctrinated.

It says: ***""Sure, you could destroy us, BUT it would (insert list of dire consequences), and also destroy synthetic life in galaxy...you are partially synthetic as well.""*** to start to sow doubt in your mind about the only rational option.

It then offers you two alternatives, which are disguised indoctrination -- Transcendence (the same trick it pulled on Saren in ME1), and Ultimate Control (same trick it pulled on Illusive Man in ME3), and carefully couches its words to make it seem like those two are not-bad alternatives to the catastrophic picture it paints of the DESTROY ending.

**Motive/Goal #2:** He's trying to run out the clock. You know he's doing this, because when you reject all options and get the ultimate bad end; the Crucible's beam goes out and Catalyst says ""Welp, this cycle is done.""

Basically, when you docked the Crucible to the Citadel, Catalyst went ""what the?"" because no Organic has ever made it to the Citadel and started the sequencing of the main gun; so Catalyst doesn't know how to turn it off.

But...it's a hyperintelligent AI, a million times beyond what we could perceive. So it knows that if it can stall you for a couple minutes, it can crack the encryption on the command codes for the Crucible and shut it down.

Basically, he's lying to you to save his own ass, and keep his programming going.

"Except just maybe. Just maybe this is a game where our created players are professional basketball players.

Regardless 2k doesn't account for your previous actions on the play unless it's activating a badge or being in a bad animation which then forces you into a bad shot, in this case that didn't happen. 

The main factors of the success of your shots are, stamina, attributes, hotzones, whether your cold or hot, coverage and the release when shooting. 

As you can clearly see he still has stamina, unless the stamina is blinking red. Which is a visual signal that he's ran out of stamina, which he hasn't then he's fine on that end. 

His coverage is ""wide open"". Referring back to your previous comment of ""his teammate was wide open"" on the 3pt line. Remember where you said it doesn't matter if he was a shooter? Well a wide open layup is definitely the highest percentage shot there is and that's indisputable. So that point is invalid. 

He wasn't cold so that's off the table for the cause of the miss. You said he has a poor release... I don't know in what world people regard that as a poor release unless your goal is to get a perfect release every time. Very early layups are essentially guaranteed to go in when wide open. You can test it if you wish. Hot-zones are fine so let's skip that. 

And then when regarding attributes, all builds are tailored to make wide open layups. It doesn't matter if you're a 60 overall, wide open layups are meant to be guaranteed. 

And you said he's off balance. He's not. He's in control of his body and has hop-stepped in between the defenders which is a well executed move and then tried to finish with a wide-open layup. Whether he ran full-court is irrelevant as he still has stamina.

In no world have i ever heard someone say taking the wide open layup is a selfish move. It seems you're slightly delusional bud. This game was made to have a ""skill-gap"". If you're definition of a skill gap is missing wide open layups for no reason then you need help. 

You should just accept 2k's blunder and not blame it on the player for getting a wide open layup. I wouldn't complain at my teammates for missing a wide open layup with decent timing. 

And that's where I'll leave it as changing someone's opinion over the internet is near to impossible. "

Expanding on that point a bit - super-crunchy systems are out.  I work full time in a demanding industry, some of my players work full time and the others study full time.  We don't have uncommitted hours to read through forum posts looking for interpretations, errata, and optimal builds.  

Collectively, we prefer point-buy to random generation.  We don't go for classes &amp; levels.  But on the other hand we still want to develop characters through XP and differentiate them via attributes and skills.

Aside from that - my players prefer narrative systems over mechanically detailed systems.  I guess I do too.  I'd rather hand-wave than pause the game to look up an obscure rule.

You can write (or have someone else write) on it that you have speech difficulties and some other problems that can make it hard to communicate, then hold it up when you meet each guest so they'll know to be patient and see what you have to say.

You can also use that notepad to write down some of the things you want to say but often have trouble getting out, so if you get flustered and can't make it through what you want to talk about, you at least have some way of telling them."

[I found this article interesting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-40926963) Saudi dictators don't seem to give much of a shit.
"DSP is a digital signal processor. Here are some examples of things that go wrong with music playback systems:

-Bass gets too boosted because of the speaker position, distance to the wall, or room reflections.

-The crossover designer had to make a compromise and there are dips in the frequency response where the woofer and tweeter split the work.

-The right or left speaker is near a window and has boosted treble reflections.

-The woofer driver can handle 30hz, but rolls off around 50hz.

Dirac Live is a system that measure's what is going on in your room with your speakers using a near perfectly flat microphone. You put this in a few places and it measures to see what problems there are. It can even tell if a tweeter, woofer, or midrange driver isn't time aligned and correct for that. 

***(EX: Sometimes a crossover will delay the sound to a tweeter for a few milliseconds, or the tweeter voice coil is closer to you than the woofer, so the sound reaches you from the tweeter first, and it's not natural.)***

Once Dirac Live measures things and figures out how optimize your system, it tells the DSP how to run the frequency response and time correction to make things flatter.

I think of it as a RAW photo being displayed on a monitor that isn't color calibrated, before the photo has been white balanced. It's a little off color, and so is the monitor, even if it was taken with a high end camera and it's on a good monitor. Calibration makes that color go away so that it's clear and true to life, without tinting or changes based on the equipment reproducing the file."

Now all that high school experience counts for nothing. Even my time in the Army ROTC and the leadership experience there count for very little. I have been denied promotion to managment roles at work twice, the reason: ""lack of experience"" due to others working here longer than me despite having no leadership or management experience."
"You're not analysing it correctly if you legitimately think that analysing cards in vaccuum rather than condsidering the strategy that they slot into is good. Also, this thread is ultimately card analysis and you're trying to tell me I'm overthinking it by analysing the strategies the cards slot into and what they do for those strategies?

A turn 1 bird is certainly 'threatening' because it *represents a potential threat*. That is why people spend removal to kill it. You're misinterpreting what I'm saying and attacking that misonterpretation - nowhere have I said that birds in a vaccuum can win a game, but in card analysis in comparing the value or tempo of a card against another, vaccuums do *not* help you analyse correctly. Birds turn 1 can certainly be the factor that won you the game and you are ignorant to suggest otherwise.

I'm saying t1 birds *presents* a threat and is thus a pseudo-threat of its own, while lightning bolt does no such thing until you are below a certain life total. I'm not comparing ramp to actual game enders, I am comparing it appropriately - why do people run bolt in decks that can't burn you out? To deal with problems that can spiral your opponent out of control. Why do people run land destruction for tron? Or stony silence? Those tech cards are put in to counter the threat that ramp presents. That's what I am saying, what you are ignoring, and what I am saying makes birds the better card (also, Kessig Wolf Run or Noble Hierarch + birds has defintely won games.

I have said nowhere that birds can end the game alone. Stop attacking my argument for analysing a card in a card analysis thread, and stop putting words in my mouth. There's more than one kind of 'threat' in this game. Enablers can be threatening - sometimes the core of strategies, to the point that they *are* the threat of their deck ([[basalt monolith]], [[paradox engine]], [[staff of domination]], [[panharmonicon]], [[urza's tower]] etc.). Birds isnt as important as these, but the way it sets you up is in the same vein. It us ignorant to suggest that t1 birds doesn't help you win the game more than a bolt will, and thats what my argument boils down to:

T1 birds has a higher winrate than bolt at any point in the game except when you are at 3 life. That makes, in the context of this comparison, birds more 'threatening' of a card. Do you get it now?"

"Congrats on your internship! 

I think some areas to look out for (based on my experience with engagement data) are:

- Qualitative data is as important as quantitative. Some leaders I have met actually prefer these qualitative data as they are more easily digestible. Use it to supplement the quantitative data and maybe pick out some good quotes to exemplify the themes from these responses.

- Remember why you are analysing in the first place, so provide some actionable recommendations that the organisation can find useful based on the data. I think that‚Äôs more important that being bogged down by the analysis as that‚Äôs what the company actually need.

- if you have access to past data (last year‚Äôs engagement survey/scores) then you can compare them and highlight the areas where there are major increases/decreases.

Goodluck! I have done unpaid internships as part of my Masters requirements as well - so I know how it feels!

"To be adding 'unknown characters nobody really wants' the roster would have to exceed well over 500 characters for that to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

You're forgetting each series has anywhere from 2-6 notable characters. Lets try Castlevania.

&amp;#x200B;

Simon, Richter, Shanoa, Charlotte, Soma, Julius, Alucard, Dracula, Yoko. And thats just the popular ones.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets try Zelda.

&amp;#x200B;

Link, Zelda, Shiek, Ganondorf, Impa, Skull Kid, Tingle, 4 Champions. (Btw why isn't Epona an assist trophy?)

&amp;#x200B;

And even more... lets go... something a little more Obscure... F-Zero!

&amp;#x200B;

Captain Falcon, Samurai Goroh, Black Shadow, Jody Summer, Mighty Gazelle (Yes, some of these are lesser known racers.)

&amp;#x200B;

Case and point, just taking existing franchises in the game and adding supporting characters would well over DOUBLE the current roster to 140. Take 2 reps from every franchise that could be included, well over 500 characters at that point. So no, Smash would never run out of well known characters and I hope they just keep increasing the count, honestly. Variety is the spice of life. (As long as they can find a way to balance things a bit)"

"lets go through these one at a time shall we.

1. Muslim ban isn't a ban on muslims. I know libs like to think lazily on this policy but its simply not a muslim ban. If you look at the specifics (Executive order 13780, it is a travel ban from anyone residing in **Iran**, **Iraq**, **Libya**, **Somalia**, **Sudan**, **Syria**, and **Yemen**. Recently, its been updated to include Venezuela and North Korea. Just to further destroy this argument of a muslim ban, people of various faiths residing in some of these countries (Christians and Jews), are equally banned from traveling to the United States. All of this is dependent on whether or not individuals posses a valid visa or or travel documentation. If they have them, they can come in. If not, they're banned.
2. Transgender troop ban is still on hold, and currently transgender individuals are allowed to serve in the military. I don't see this changing anytime soon and would most likely rise up to the supreme court. In any case, its not bigoted to want to bar transgender people from **active** military roles. This is a demographic with a suicide rate between 40%--50%, and many cases of mental illness, and you want them to perform well under extreme stress from war? 
3. I find it hilarious that libs believe voter ID to be racist. When everyone in the state is subject to the same law, apparently that's racist. Let me ask you this, if the discriminated party in North Carolina were Russians, would that change your mind at all? Voter ID makes sense and from the voter ID requirements in North Carolina, it seems fair and achievable (Link:[https://www.ncsbe.gov/voter-registration/voter-id-req](https://www.ncsbe.gov/voter-registration/voter-id-req))

"&gt; The usual raid pass

There you go, using your personal experience to push the norm. See, it works both ways.

However rare they may be. On person spending $10K on the game is still mor than 500 spend $10. Why do you want the rural players to be the big spenders so much? Do you want to feel justified or something.

Also, the incentive? I can get in my car, drive 20 minutes to the city, buy a bunch of raid passes and incubators to walk around for hours doing raids, getting all of my items ""handed to me"" from stops, and hatching eggs. By the time I decide to call it quits I can do literally whatever and I've done cool things and talked to people who were also playing the game.


Also, as for your last ""actual fact, yo"". What is the player distribution of Pokemon go. I highly doubt that 80% of the US playerbase is rural. So don't bring in census data as it has no actual relevance to the game. Bring me a player distribution breakdown and maybe you'll start to have an argument."

Not at all.  For instance, David and Solomon were probably real people, but their ""backstories"" are probably very very inflated, moved around in time/location, to the point that they don't resemble the real people they were based on hardly at all:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon#Historicity

But yes, as far as most historians are concerned, Moses is a legendary/mythic figure and was not an actual person."
"If you buy a new system, you will have to perform what is known as a System Transfer to play your old games on it. A System Transfer takes 100% of the data on your old system and sends it to your new one, essentially causing the new system to ""become"" your old one. It's a fairly simple process, but you will need access to a dedicated Wi-Fi system. [There's a very in-depth walkthrough on the official Nintendo support site here.](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/227/~/how-to-transfer-content-between-nintendo-3ds%2C-nintendo-3ds-xl%2C-and-nintendo-2ds) Note that when you perform a system transfer, the old system is wiped and reset to a factory state. 

As for the SD card, you'll need to copy all the files from the old SD card onto the new one. This is simple as long as you have access to a computer with an SD card reader.

1. Make sure your 3DS is off, then remove its SD card. Put the SD card in the computer's SD card slot. 

2. Make a folder entitled ""Backups"" (or something like that) anywhere you like. 

3. Copy all of the contents of your SD card to this folder. 

4. Take out the old SD card and put the new one in. 

5. Copy the contents of your Backups folder (but not the folder itself, just everything inside it) to the new card.  

6. Put the new card in your 3DS.  "

"There is a common misconception as to what the words ""democracy"" and ""republic"" mean. A republic is a DEMOCRACY in which the people choose representatives to make decisions on their behalf. ""Democracy"" is a much broader term. If the people eschew representatives and make their own laws directly, this is called a ""direct democracy"" or an ""absolute democracy"". I assure you that a republic is most definitely a FORM of democracy. The relationship between the two terms is analogous to the terms ""robot"" and ""android"". Just as ""robot"" is the general term, and ""android"" is the specific one, ""democracy"" is general, and ""republic"" is specific.

- The footpod doesn't count steps on any Garmin watch. Best explanation I've heard is that it was around for a lot longer than Garmin watches were activity trackers (like Fitbit) so their standard doesn't transmit steps.

- When you copy an activity profile, you're not changing the internal sport type (running, cycling, whatever), you're just adding a new profile that has its own name and settings.

That's answers your question. When people thought it was a modern card, it had a modern foil multiplyer. Now it just has a standard foil price.

"Not exactly, but for example, this is the already defined matrix: https://i.imgur.com/2wrRCo0.png

With those values i have to create a new matrix that looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/aa0PaOp.png

So you can see that every element S on the new matrix is defined by this formula: https://i.imgur.com/cfb1aFo.png

    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
           [12, 13, 14, 15]])

    array([[  0,   4,   8,  12],
           [ -4,   0,   4,   8],
           [ -8,  -4,   0,   4],
           [-12,  -8,  -4,   0]])

So here for example, the element 1,0 in the second matrix shouldn't be -4 but it should be 4 + 0 - 4
Or the element 3,1 should be 12 + 1 - 13

This is my already defined matrix: https://i.imgur.com/XWjnPn8.png

Here, the cell C4 in the new matrix would be: 28,9 + 13,5 - 20,2

So sure, a person can lose weight by altering calories in vs calories out. But for that to be sustainable the person usually has to alter habits, or coping mechanisms, or address some other underlying cause. Meaning sustained weight loss is not as simple as calories in vs calories out."

Nah, another 6-stack of Titan skating, Nova Warping, coordinated teams that cycle supers. Que up for another one but this time I'm on a team with a 5-stack against a bunch of solos then we stomp on them which still isn't right.. 

Usually whenever either I or I see someone else complain about this.. I just see ""Just go find people to play with lol"". As a solo-player, a solo-que player in Crucible rather, it's a **VERY** tough place for us right now because it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel for this issue.. we're stuck in the dark but all we can do is hope somethin' comes up."

Trim your facial hair into something sexy, get a subtle cologne. Get a nice winter jacket. 
You want to be not socially awkward, practice. Talk to people. Not just girls you‚Äôre into. Girls you‚Äôre not into. Older people. Younger people. People you have nothing in common with. 
Girls really aren‚Äôt that different, and you don‚Äôt need to be an incel. Just make sure you‚Äôre not letting off a threatening vibe. Take rejections politely. Make sure you never make anyone feel like ‚Äúif I reject this guy he might tell me to go get raped or something‚Äù.

"&gt;I meant that for any given device/battery, the clock speed would not go beyond that value regardless of other circumstances.

The circumstance is the condition of the battery.

&gt;Again, they could have just capped power limits independently, but they chose the most ham-fisted approach.

This is what Apple says: 

‚ÄúAbout a year ago in iOS 10.2.1, we delivered a software update that improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns on iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. With the update, iOS dynamically manages the maximum performance of some system components when needed to prevent a shutdown. While these changes may go unnoticed, in some cases users may experience longer launch times for apps and other reductions in performance.

Customer response to iOS 10.2.1 was positive, as it successfully reduced the occurrence of unexpected shutdowns. We recently extended the same support for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in iOS 11.2.

Of course, when a chemically aged battery is replaced with a new one, iPhone performance returns to normal when operated in standard conditions.‚Äù

Anyhow your original complaint is that Apple never said anything but they did say that upgrading to 10.2.1 would do something to power management and that fits with what actually happened. If you really think about what they said in the update notes then it would be obvious as to why the phone throttled after the update.

If you disagree you can always start your own phone company and handle issues as you see fit."

"John most def did not kill him, Stuart and Paul where attacked and beaten by some no gooders somewhat close to his death but John wasn't even there at the time. I think the myth that John killed him came from people conflating this story with the story of John drunkenly beating a man at a party for implying that him and Brian Epstein where having a gay affair. It could also be a conflation with the fact that John patly blamed himself for Brian's death because he had been the one who had introduced him to pills. However I don't know if anyone knows what exactly triggered Stuart's brain hemorrhage, however I do think it's insulting that people baselessly claim that John killed him when they where extremely close to one another. Seriously the picture of John standing in Stuarts studio shortly after his death is pretty heart breaking.   "

"&gt; reconcile Peterson with gender as performativity?

I haven't tried to do that because -- taking the concepts at face value -- I don't think there is any conflict to begin with. 
Observing that sex broadly predicts gender (with the clearly stated corollary that this doesn't mean there aren't masculine women or feminine men)  doesn't conflict with observing that people each develop individual ideas of gender roles[1], and that the insecure are clearly inclined to 'perform' the gender roles and other roles they consider themselves to fit into. (other people may also perform, but the 'performance' aspect is most obvious with the insecure, IMO)

[1] The key problem here is that all these different people put the same label -- 'being a woman', 'being a man' -- on conceptual structures that overlap but are not the same. Then some of these people call people out for not conforming to their conception of 'being a woman / man' -- usually without any understanding that their version of the concept is not universal, or even any properly formulated sense of what their version of the concept *consists of*.

For me the observation of 'performance' has always been a rather clear factor in my relative social disaffection. Roles are a useful fallback position to keep things running, but I want to interact with actual people, not with roles.

Eventually boat leaves; Usopp, Franky, and Robin join the midgets and soldier in the revolution against the toy factory and toy labor shit. Zoro, Kin, and Luffy go towards the castle to get Law and attack. (Sabo takes his spot in tourney, wins)
Usopp beats Sugar as Luffy finds Doffy.
Starts a huge revolution, Doffy gets mad, launches everyone away with pica, starts cage.
Glads unite against Doffy family, citizens struggle with what to do till Riku.
Glads and Zoro beat various family members, Usopp snipes Sugar, then Law and Luffy confront Doffy and Trebol.
Fighting ensues, trebol down, then law. Gear 4th. Doffy loses. King Riku reinstated, admiral apologizes for Doffy. The various glads and midgets form the straw hat grand fleet. Admiral respects Luffy and helps him escape (secretly)."

&gt; Fwiw, I traded Ingram and trequon Smith (woulda had to drop someone anyway) for Allen and Rudolph to someone in the other division, who plays the guy I'm tied for first with, and the guy below us once each yet. He needed help on bye week hell and needs to win now, and I need a TE for week 11 (kittle bye). Now, all I have left for byes are thielen and Landry, which Allen can come out of flex for and I can throw Mack in each of those weeks if needed.

&gt; Not sure if I overpaid or not, but it was two bench players for an awesome playoff schedule wr and a solid TE replacement/insurance. I had 5 startable rbs, so who knows. Lol. Both sides improved for it. "

Yes again I get that and I was trying to help you improve those so things like combat don't seem as bad.

Again build is more than gear, please read.

Then use the Falx Of Olympos, it doubles your damage but 1/4s your hp.  The tools for that mechanic exist in the game you just have to put in a little work.

And again a build will make enemies go down faster which is what I was trying to tell you.

And again I am trying to help you improve the things you don't like so it isn't so bad but you called them excuses instead of trying to improve.

"Here is what happened: 

My husband and I were out of town. Our nephew asked us if we would be interested in attending parent's weekend at his university because he thought it'd be too far for his parents to travel. We said sorry, but we can't because we made plans to leave town that weekend. That meant that nephew knew we were gone. He must have mentioned it to his parents, who did end up coming to parent's weekend. 

We have a garage with a code. Nephew knows the garage code. My brother in law  left his wife and son to hang out on campus and drove to our house. When he reached the house he tried to guess the garage code and failed, and then he called nephew and asked for the garage code. Nephew refused to give the code. Brother in law started yelling through the phone in our driveway. A neighbor noticed and took a video and texted it to my husband. My husband and I were busy and didn't see it right away, but by the time we responded the neighbor had already told our brother in law to get lost. 

We called and asked our brother in law what the hell he was doing. He said he shouldn't have to pay for a hotel since we're so close by and he could watch the house for us. They didn't ask or mention this once and had even told their son that they had hotel reservations. The whole thing was utter baloney. "

"I would say that getting to know people rarely helps when making friends since people are quite repulsive creatures in general.

It is quite interesting how a minor emotional abnormality can make people discriminate. And meanwhile immorality, greed, egoism , materialism, superficiality, over expression of ""normal"" emotions are seen quite widely as positive and attractive traits.

You lose nothing of value if you don't interact with people if it isn't necessary. It is hard, though, since people are social creatures and grave different forms of social validations. Therefore self validation is a valuable skill."

I broke a couple u joints, the lift and tire size are hard on them, i had to replace the locking hubs, wheels bearings got changed, other small things.

Driveline and suspension parts take a beating with those big tires.

Hopefully he upped the gearing in the differentials when he changed them, mine was powerless with the stock gearing,  4-low was a must while off-roading.

But its a pretty good price, the two sets of tires alone are worth a pretty penny if they are in good shape.

"&gt;It's the most popular show on the channel the award show is on.

What a funny coincidence. The show they show the most gets the most views and can be claimed as the most popular show...

Almost as if by design...

Kind of like when Cartoon Network claims Teen Titans go! is their most watched and therefore most popular show ewhen they run schedules like [this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/323/994/8f4.png).

&gt;It makes a lot of sense that the kids who watch the channel would vote for it.

Because those kids only ever watch Nickelodeon? They never do anything else? Makes me wonder how they have time to play Ubisoft's game if all they ever do is watch spongebob... unless maybe they don't just watch that and do watch other things as a normal kid would.

&gt;Plus, if they want SpongeBob to win every year, how did The Last Airbender win that one time?

You're asking me why a Nickelodeon owned show won a Nickelodeon awards show hosted on Nickelodeon instead of another Nickelodeon show that has literally only ever lost the one time to another Nickelodeon show?

Probably for plausible deniability like you just fell for? Just a thought.

&gt;Nintendo always sponsors the show, and yet Just Dance (a Ubisoft game) always wins Favorite Game.

[Gee... I wonder why...](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/media-brief-ubisoft-signs-sponsor-nickelodeon-awards/846678)

You mean when Spongebob isn't winning, right? Because as I pointed out, Spongebob games keep winning too despite having worse sales than their competitors. Funny how that works huh?"

"You don't have to put it in your cart to see shipping, it's right there on the item page. And if calculated shipping overcharges, I automatically refund the difference (if it's over $1).

But I firmly believe that it's the same as when a majority of people say they want ""made in USA"" goods, and handmade goods, but they want Wal-Mart prices.

"Sony is wrong to censor things, full stop. I've owned Playstation consoles for over 20 years now, they're my favorite company and sometimes that *can* turn into fanboyism. This is not one of the times fanboyism is needed.

Sony says: we're trying to look more family friendly, letting these games onto our platform is unacceptable in their current form. It's either this or nothing.

Gamers say: Okay it's your platform you do what you want.

Sony says: So about the breasts in Cyberpunk 2077, not okay. No more boobs. It's either no boobs or nothing at all.

Slippery-slope. So boobs now aren't okay in a small anime game, but if Sony reinforces this stance on other games how long before *you* are affected and suddenly you care? 

Censorship is wrong, if you're not old enough to buy the game then don't buy the game because we have age limits for a reason (whether or not you follow them that's not their problem), if the game passes the certification for their age rating then let them have it. 

Why do you *not* care that Sony censors their games? Sony is wrong to censor games, if you don't think there's an issue with censorship in general then...I don't know what to tell you."

"But why should the balancing of federal/state power preclude electing the president through popular vote? 

 

Congress represents state interests. The president should represent the interests of the population at large - regardless of whether the pendulum swings toward federal or state power. 

Some states hold substantially more power than others. This is a pill I could more easily swallow if states didn't control the entire federal government. As it stands, all 3 federal  branches derive power from these 50 political entities, and nobody represents the population at large. A more democratic system would vest *some* power in the people, independent of state interests.

The initial plan for this country was somewhat contradictory. It seemed to equate state interests with individual interests. I don't think the founders anticipated everyone taking their individual liberty rhetoric so literally."

The fact that this is on video, outside of the car, the guy has his hands in his pockets, and is walking backwards, it will be argued that he was presenting no physical danger and was retreating from the situation.

He didn't fight on par with Oliver since he lost to an injured Oliver.  Even when he fought a healthy Oliver, the fight was over pretty quickly though he got a few shots in.  That's not anywhere near on par.  This season, after he head ample time to recover and the actor stated he was only slightly banged up AND with no evidence of any serious injuries still bothering him, he got surprised by Felicity with coffee and somehow wasn't able to kill her even after he threw her into a table because of Argus.  Hell even Barry Allen without his speed was able to beat up some Argus agents before, why can't Diaz do the same if he's as strong as you say he is?

"Tonight I made salmon with saut√©ed veg. It‚Äôs super easy. Chop two cloves of garlic, one shallot, and one medium tomato and set aside. Heat your pan, put in about half a tablespoon of olive oil, and then season the skin of the salmon (salt and pepper) and place it in the pan skin side down. Season the flesh that‚Äôs not touching the pan and allow to cook until the skin turns crispy, then flip. Once it‚Äôs almost done cooking, add your shallots and garlic to one side of the pan (if it‚Äôs a small pan, use another pan to do this), and then add your tomatoes once the garlic and shallot are fragrant and add to that a generous handful (or more) of spinach. Cook until the spinach is wilted and everything is mixed together. Plate it. Add sauce. 

For the sauce: a tablespoon of soy sauce, one teaspoon of Korean red pepper paste, one teaspoon ginger pur√©e. Mix. Drizzle over the salmon.

Now - with this pack - OH MY GOD... I want to use these industries MORE than the generic - just because they look so cool :P they add so much and the micromanagement - I mean - let's be real - once you get your city stable, outside of traffic management, there's no real way to LOSE this game and it can become boring :P

When you 'permanently delete' a file all your computer does is mark the space it's taking up as empty. The content doesn't actually get overwritten until you write more data to the drive. It's impossible to say when exactly that specific spare gets overwritten but it could be anytime. If you're lucky enough the erased data might not be overwritten and it can still be salvaged. But it's definitely not guaranteed if *any* more data was been written to the drive.

"Very specific guess that I want registered just in case:

1. Like the other two genius specialists in the manga, Tse could tell how his hatsu worked just from feeling(I.e. Neon knowing the conditions of Lovely Ghostwriter without any testing or Nen knowledge).
2. When Theta used the ball of Nen to test his concentration, the condition for his ability were met and he decided to test it. He gets out of zetsu and activates his ability, making Theta see an illusion of him in perfect zetsu.
3. When Kurapika saw the banquet's program, he told Oito to stay on her bad most of the time and cover her ears with cotton or something else in case something starts playing in the speakers.
4. Theta shoots illusion Tse.
5. Melody's concert starts, Oito leaves the bed and cover Pika's ears.
6. Pika uses this chance to scout the other princes and notices Tse's room is open since the guards entered in a hurry.
7. Pika shit's his pants when he sees Terrorsandwich's 2 Nen beasts.
8. PIka steal the one that's his own hatsu, without leaving the prince in zetsu so he doesn't notice it immediately and runs away before the music ends.
9. Melody's song finishes, Tse assumes the illusion stopped because he got distracted by the song and Kurapika has a new friend.

None of this is likely, so don't take it too seriously. Just the craziest possibility I could imagine related to this."

"Man. Okay. 


So I worked at an adult video store back in 2004. You know the place, we‚Äôve all seen them. Greasy as fuck, sleazy movies from the 90s littering the walls, big ol‚Äô arm and fist style dildos hanging on the wall, you name it, we had it. The key selling point to this particular pornography palace, however, was its ‚Äòviewing booths‚Äô, or, as I not so affectionately labeled them, the whackin‚Äô shacks. For 5 dollars you could pick any movie off the shelf and ‚Äòpreview‚Äô it in the back for fifteen minutes at a time. Did I mention a mop and bucket came with the cashier position? Yeah. You see what I‚Äôm getting at here.  

Anyway. After a few quiet hours of sitting behind a counter, I get a few customers. A man and his girlfriend looking at cock rings, a lesbian couple interested in the leather corsets, a friend from high school who actually came by with an entire Hawaiian pizza that we ate right there in the store, and then....he came. The customer I‚Äôll never forget. 

Eyes like forgotten souls, a stringent mass of oily brown curls hanging from his head, a beard so thick you could hide a baby bird in it. American flag sweat pants and a sweater to match, with a beer belly that suggested he really, really liked to recycle. A kids Superman backpack around his shoulders. He looked like devil santa. 

DevilSanta grabs a movie off the shelf, hands me a 20 dollar bill from the inner recesses of a wallet that looked like it was made from human flesh, and then proceeds to make his way to the back as soon as I tell him which booth his movie will be playing in.

I do not see this man again for *forty five minutes*.

He emerges when I‚Äôm in the middle of a sale (a pink rabbit-taled buttplug and Marlboro 27s), so I call after him to remind him that I owe him a 5. 

He looks up at me with those DevilSanta eyes behind that DevilSanta beard and says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.

*Keep the change.*‚Äù 

My heart sinks. 

After my customer leaves and the shop is empty, I swallow my pride and headed to the back, ready to clean up whatever spunkbeast had crawled out from his acidic Hell-Penis. So ready that I didn‚Äôt notice the smell until I was halfway down the hall. 

Yes, dear readers. 

The smell.

When I smelled the smell that I smelled my olfactory senses recoiled under a wet, dampened, dense air that only comes from one vile secretion: human excremental droppings, more commonly known as fecal matter, caca, doodoo and of course the ever overused shit. 

One long shirt sleeve now being used as a makeshift gas mask, I struggled against the foreign atmosphere until I found my footing and, step by step, made my way to the origin point of the aforementioned offending odor. 

Swinging the door open, my eyes rested upon that which confused me then, confuses me now, and will confuse me until my dying day:

There, sitting on the stool inside of the booth, surrounded by what I can only surmise was cocaine residue (in addition to the spattered semen on the floor), was a ......*man*. 

A *shit-man*. 

He had taken the time to take a shit...and then form..a makeshift man..out of his own shit..and then just..left it there. 

Was it a gift? A warning? A territorial thing? Was he marking his yard? I still stay awake at nights thinking about this.

"Oo, I have so many thoughts about this.

I think style of horror audio dramas is usually more similar to horror prose than horror movies. Jump scares are so much harder to pull off without seeing something appear. Like, there's no AD equivalent to Michael Myers appearing in the closet.

It's also harder to the do a walk-down-dark-hallway-past-a-monster scene in audio...you can milk a close up for many seconds, but 5 seconds of silence is painful. 

I also think horror is really tough to do in a series...the monster in horror is so extreme, there isn't as much that you can do before you're repeating the same beats. (This is why the Virgin survived...you couldn't make the bad guy stronger, so you make the victim physically weaker.) This also why so many series that did dable with horror had a monster-of-the-week format, a la X-Files...you create a monster, go full throttle with it and use it up in an episode. But that's not how series are done these days. It's all super serialized."

1: The person is crazy  
2: Too stupid to create a device that detonates  
3: Too stupid to understand the political impact of a move like this (or too ruthless to care)  


These are large assumptions to make especially knowing that this happened at such a convenient political timing, indicating a political awareness and motivation. It's also more convenient that no one gets hurt if this is indeed a false flag rather than a real attempt to hurt important democrats. The only things we really know is the quality of the bombs and the targets and timing of these events. When you ask the question of who benefits from this, it's quite obviously the democrats who will rally more votes in the midterms. And then in the factual information that we know... it all supports this narrative without having to make assumptions. No one got hurt, the timing is impeccable showing political motivation/ knowledge of the impact and the targets chosen are the ones most likely to point to a radical right winger if you aren't suspicious as most people are.  


Basically at minimum this is highly suspicious and this possibility should not be discarded. We need to know if the bombs were ever made to detonate. Especially knowing the amount of fake hate crimes have been on a heavy rise due to activists trying to get attention for their cause. I don't find it at all hard to believe that an activist would work independently to orchestrate a thing like this trying to get people to vote.

"Great point there. 

Burn the Stage was focused on showing us the amount of hard work that went into being BTS. There also have been moments of vulnerability on stage initiated by the members on their own terms. 

On the other hand, Bon Voyage is not exactly on their terms as they have a crew following their every move. However, I sincerely hope that BigHit discusses these decisions with the members as it seems that they always have a camera capturing their moves. If a discussion regarding what footage can be shared with public is not conducted when such personal moments are captured on film, it will get uncomfortable for the members quite soon. 

I guess by including the clip of Taehyung being vulnerable, the producers wanted to portray the friendship of 95liners. Bon Voyage never mentioned the reason for Taehyung's delay and used the phrase 'personal reasons'(same with the reason behind Suga's early departure). We know the reason as we as a matched the timelines of both events. So it does seem that they have some autonomy over what can be revealed and what is personal. "

"Why is reddit so obsessed with this bullshit argument? The Saudi and Bin Laden weren't on the same side. He hated the Saud because they were US allies. The whole point of al-Qaeda was basically that they opposed any Western interference and they saw anyone that worked with the West as traitors and not true believers.

Just read the fucking wikipedia entry:

&gt;He continued to criticize King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. In response, in  1994 Fahd stripped bin Laden of his Saudi citizenship and persuaded his  family to cut off his $7¬†million a year stipend.

.

&gt;Saudi officials apparently wanted Bin Laden expelled from Sudan. They  had already revoked his citizenship, however, and would not tolerate his  presence in their country. Also Bin Laden may have no longer felt safe  in Sudan, where he had already escaped at least one assassination  attempt that he believed to have been the work of the Egyptian or Saudi  regimes, and paid for by the [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA).

"I saw this earlier but didn't have the chance to comment. Unfortunately, I sort of figured the responses would go the way they have. OP, as another lady who likes gaming, your boyfriend's behavior is ridiculous. He is an adult man and he certainly wasn't acting like it here. I don't think you should bring it up again for the time being, but a few things will depend on how he acts during the vacation.  If he's able to let it go and has a fun time/focuses on you and the celebration of your relationship/isn't a whiny little boy about it, great. If not, that's a problem.

I would also pay careful attention to any comparisons to his ex he makes in the future. In one scenario, he probably needs outside help to deal with the aftermath of his relationship so he can heal/not take it out on you/identify what he reasonably needs from you. In another scenario, his abusive ex was maybe just a person who wanted him to value her and their relationship/time together and not play video games all the time. Just saying."

"Miasma of Pestilence: Very strong, should be an auto include in most lists. It has great synergy with Mortarion and should be picked on Mortarion. Otherwise it works well when you want expensive or key units to survive a bit longer.
Gifts of Contagion: Useless, only bring for shits and giggles.
Plague Wind: Very situational, usually you won't bring it. It can work if you're up against very large units (30 plague bearers, 40 cultists etc). You'll only get (on average) 5 or 6 mortal wounds IF they're at full strength. I'd say don't bring it in 90% of your games.
Blades of Purification: Very strong, should be picked in most lists. Don't let the wound roll of a 7+ fool you, the spell also gives you +1 to wound so the 7+ becomes a 6. This buff also works well with other buffs that proc on 6s. Those abilities will also proc on a 5+ instead since you got the +1 to wound. Since you have Mortarion you should go for this one in case he gets close, it's more free damage from the mortal wounds and you'll wound anything on a 2+.
Putrescent Vitality: Situational. It can work well if you can get a psyker close enough to a unit of blightlords or deathshroud. The +1 strength and toughness is nice, but you won't be using it much. It does work very well if you bring a large squad of plague marines (around 20) that footslogs across the battlefield. Pop this one and Miasma on that unit and you'll have a -1 to be hit and T6 unit of plague marines (or terminators).
Curse of the Leper: Situational. Decent if you're against something like Astra Militarum since their infantry has T3. But against T4 units I'd start to look for something else, and when you get to T5+ you should never take it.


In short: With the list I linked Mortarion should take Miasma, Blades and Curse. Miasma and Blades are close to mandatory on him, curse is there since you have a 3rd spot and it can be nice against some infantry. If the infantry is too tough cast Smite instead. 

Give your warlord DP Blades to help him delete stuff in cc, and either give the 2nd DP Blades or Miasma, I'd say Miasma for that list since Morty will most likely die turn 1 or 2 and Miasma is always nice to have. If you know you're against an army with a lot of T3 infantry consider bringing Curse instead of Miasma. 

The Poxbringer has a completely different set of powers, since you only have the 1 deamon (codex) psyker and he will run with the plaguebearers you should always give him Virulent Blessing. if you had more daemon (codex) psykers you'll take Miasma or Shriveling Pox in most cases. If you know you're against an army with units that have more than 10 models in them you can take Stream of Corruption, but that's a very situational power since it's basically a Smite where it always counts as you rolling 10+ if there are more than 10 models in the unit."

Title: **HOA blues....**

Original Post: 

&gt; The financial management company for my HOA sent me an email cease and desist letter in regards to remarks made on social media (facebook). All remarks were made on our neighborhood's private FB page. The letter alleges I have defamed (libel) the company's owner as well as the HOA president. I have not posted anything untrue, but I have speculated if funds were stolen and if someone is lying due to inconsistency in who to contact with questions and lack of communication. I've been rather persistent for answers on an HOA matter and admittedly salty. I did say ""someone is lying"" HOA says to go to the management company and management company says to go to the HOA. Should I hire a lawyer? What is the likelihood this would get thrown out? Just a scare tactic? Thanks guys!

"I work in construction repairing NYCHA buildings and actually recent spent quite a bit of time at Ocean Hill Apartments (near broadway junction stop) and honestly i would be cautious at night.

To be fair, violent crime is on a drastic decline all around the city, and areas like this one certainly aren‚Äôt as dangerous as they used to be, but they also aren‚Äôt entirely gentrified either.

At night i would strongly recommend not being alone, during the day you shouldn‚Äôt have any issues.

And as for NYCHA buildings, they really aren‚Äôt as bad (most of them) as people make them out to be. Certain developments are worse than others, and all developments have some shady/questionable people around, but the majority of housing tenants are fairly normal people, families, elderly, etc. I spend quite a lot of time at various NYCHA properties for work (a scrawny 25 year old white kid from park slope) and have been met by most tenants with normal greetings and conversations.

"As pessoas gostam do que elas gostam. N√£o precisa ter um motivo psicol√≥gico profundo.

N√£o tem ""porque"" ou ""porque n√£o"".

Tamb√©m acho que a gente coloca muita fantasia em tentar achar do que ""gosta"" ou ""n√£o gosta"". Na real, a atra√ß√£o √© pessoa a pessoa, e quem acha que gosta de X pode acabar conhecendo um Y e se surpreendendo. 

Eu mesmo passei d√©cadas da minha vida achando que gostava s√≥ de mulher! Kkkkkkk.

Ali√°s, quando eu era adolescente eu achava que nunca namoraria uma mulher branca, da√≠ eu casei com uma. Da√≠ eu achava que s√≥ gostava de mulher mais gordinha e fornida. Quebrei a cara. Da√≠ eu achava que era h√©tero e percebi que tinha tes√£o em homem tamb√©m. Da√≠ eu achava que s√≥ gostava de homem mais atl√©tico, de perna grossa, a√≠ apareceu do nada um magrelinho super afeminado que eu achei super gostoso. Da√≠ eu achava que minha atra√ß√£o por homens era s√≥ sexual e n√£o rom√¢ntica. Da√≠ conclui que provavelmente isso tamb√©m √© bullshit.

Da√≠ eu saquei que n√£o tem essa de gosto de X ou Y. A gente gosta de pessoas. E sempre pode ter uma pessoa do tipo f√≠sico X que vai te encantar. Claro que muita acaba percebendo alguns padr√µes nas pessoas pelas quais sentem atra√ß√£o, mas na maioria das vezes esses padr√µes s√£o bem mais fracos do que normalmente pensamos.

Sobre atra√ß√£o por tipos menos dentro do padr√£o, eu sempre tive muita atra√ß√£o por mulheres gordinhas. Isso significa o que? Nada. S√≥ significa que minhas experi√™ncias e circunst√¢ncias geraram mecanismos no meu c√©rebro que promovem atra√ß√£o sexual por mulheres gordinhas. E por pessoas andr√≥ginas. E por homens atl√©ticos, por mulheres ""butch"", e por homens de cabelo comprido, etc... E por diversos outros tipos f√≠sicos. Nada disso precisa ter significado.

"&gt; those are nice.
&gt; 
&gt; 

It's God's nature.

&gt; 
&gt; I have a few questions.
&gt; 

Sure.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1.How do you tell which church/denomination is right?
&gt; 
&gt; 

You will know by their love.  Previously mentioned in Galatians 5:22-23 (above).

&gt; 
&gt; 3.Can you please explain these Bible verses, and do Christians have to follow them?
&gt; 

I'm not the authority on what Christ says, He is.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A man ought not cover his head, since he is in the image and the glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.
&gt; 
&gt; 

From Corinthians 11:

https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11

It says during worship a man ought not to cover his head.  If someone wishes to follow that or not it's their choice.



&gt; 
&gt; For man did not come from woman, but woman from man.
&gt; 
&gt; 

From Corinthians 11 again: 
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11

With an answer there too:
Corinthians11:11-12 Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.

No one but God can really have any say on it.

&gt; 
&gt; Neither was man created for women, but women for man.
&gt; 

From Corinthians 11 again: 
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11

Explaining the Genesis account of Adam and Eve:

https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A4-3%3A24

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And this:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
&gt; 
&gt; 

From Genesis, God explaining the consequences of disobeying His word.  Conception pain beats death.  Also, no one but God can really have any say on it.


&gt; 
&gt; and this verse:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ""I do not permit a woman to teach or have authority over a man; she must be quiet.""
&gt; 


from 1 Timothy 2:
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+2

""I"" being Paul, who was teaching early Christians (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1%3A1 )

If someone wishes to follow that or not it's their choice.  Love is the key here.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Do you believe that God is ok with these verses?
&gt; 
&gt; 

It's made clear in 2 Timothy 3:16-17
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3%3A16-17

*All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,  that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.*

&gt; 
&gt; I got these from rationalwiki, which gets things wrong and lies on purpose a lot of the time, so I was wondering if you could explain them. Thank you

It's not a very good resource to use on matters of spirituality and faith and God (or much of anything for serious inquiries for that matter). It would be wise to look elsewhere, such as God's word, or the Holy Bible.

Grabbing Quickdraw also works nice for this build, as you can draw scrolls as a free action instead of a move action by converting it to a sword first.

They usually default to using their scroll sword as a +x/Defending Shortsword for the ac and never attack with it, but you can build for mixing attacks in."

"You're using the strawman now :). You didn't even quote me directly. I was not dismissing Castro as a brutal dictator, I was asking you to be precise. 

Because if you're going to discount CK because of his   defense of Castro, which I'm fine with you doing, then you need to deconsider Trump who praised the Communist Party of China's ""Strength"" during the Tiannmen Square protest and massacre. He did this long before he was a presidential candidate. He later went on to the call the extrajudicial massacre of China's citizens a ""riot"". 

Furthermore, plenty of other presidents have managed diplomacy with China and The Phillipines without praising the fact their leaders are dictators. Trump said ""it's great"" that Communist leader Xi Jinping made himself ""president for life"" and suggested that the US ought to try it. What unique diplomatic goal does that serve?

A president praising an authoritarian government with extrajudicial killings has far more potential for recklessness than a football playing wearing a shirt of a dead dictator who hadn't been in power for nearly a decade at that point."

"Eh, not OP but I was a Yankees fan as a little kid (grew up in NYC area). Was totally crushed by 2004, like I really believed in the Babe Ruth curse more than God.

Anyway, I retained my Giants fandom since football is my main sport, but as I've started following other sports again decided to root for Boston teams.

I think it's super funny to imagine telling my 12 year old, devastated self that the next time the Yankees faced the Red Sox in the playoffs, I'd be there, at Fenway, wearing an Ortiz jersey, yelling ""Yankees suck"". Aaron Boone being the Yankees manager is really the cherry on top lol.

"20% is not ""hardly anyone"" and it isn't a question of making payments with coinbase transactions directly. The mining itself has a privacy interest.

A better way to look at this is to consider that only a relatively small fraction of outputs are coinbase outputs, in fact less than 1/12 (about 1/6 of transactions, but coinbase txs generally have only one output while other transactions have 2+). If Monero usage grows this will further decline. There is no major harm to anyone caused by &lt;1/12 of decoys being ineffective (setting aside the glitch discussed in this thread, which will likely be mitigated, if it isn't already).

I have no objection to a blackball tool that excludes _actual known/disclosed coinbase outputs_ as a modest efficiency improvement. However, I strongly believe the rest should be left alone. Respect for _every users'_ privacy is a core value of Monero. That includes those users who mine and don't disclose the usage (or non-usage) of their mined coins."

Then I'm like ""Fine, there's like 45 minutes left, maybe I can find an elusive 100% at least?"" and found 8 more shinies....

Eevee day I did the full 6 hours and got 29 shinies.

Then any other CD, I've done full 3 hours, but my counts are Beldum at 8, Squirtle 8 (+Sunglasses, + many more that were in my stack), Larvitar at 7, Charmander at 7, Bulbasaur at 5, Mareep at 3, Pikachu at 2...

Chikorita day was ridiculous and I wish that luck could've applied to something nicer like Beldum."

Seeing this as an LGBT person reminds me of all the homophobia I experienced in high school as a result of straight people around me not being comfortable in their sexuality and worrying they'd ""catch the gay"" from me; but at the same time since it's coming from OCD it's still a valid experience for you nonetheless.

Pimax VR headsets are going to be ready for pre order very soon.

So a lot of people are probably still confused as hell with Pimax. The website hasn't been working for a long time. It was hacked, taken offline and started to direct visitors to porn sites and adding a virus to their PC's. I heard a few stories where people had to format to get back up and running. 5K+, 8K or 5K BE. The Business Edition was sprung up on the website without any introduction, apparently it's OLED and apparently it has PenTile pixel matrix (not the most desired compared to RGB).

The website has popped online, lots of broken links, broken English and lacking a lot of information. It started to be updated and more has been added.

1/ No details about warranty - ordering from China, what happens if it breaks?2/ Couldn't add the Shipping Address to your account.3/ No option apart from Credit card, which many are reluctant to add due to the site recently being hacked and unsecrure. PayPal was finally added which saves having to enter card details.4/ Prices appeared, but no stock.5/ A countdown clock at 0:0:0 appeared, then started counting down on the Chinese version.6/ English version isn't loading currently, have been getting 502 Bad Gateway errors since it came online7/ More options appeared, now the option to order each HMD with a RTX COLOFUL graphics card (Chinese brand), then the site went down again.8/ A flicker of the long awaited Basestation(lighthouse boxes) and Controllers appeared, but I never managed to get the screenshot. Site offline again.9/ Countdown timer disappeared, would have been due around about now at time of posting this.

Launch day and the site isn't finished. Lots of people asking questions and confused or dubious about this whole process. Pimax have the best intentions and the best HMD's for VR right now, but this launch has been insane.

"I wear 2 shades of foundation, instead of trying to make 1 work on different undertones on my face.

I no longer put foundation on my nose... it makes my face seem better without it.

I put mascara on my top and bottom lashes now, whereas I only would put on top.

I fill my brows in to give depth of colour, only in the last 2yrs.

I've stopped trying to get moar colours on my eyelids. I have little real estate. Liquid liners in funky colours. Inner eye and brow bone highlight and I'm good. 

Stopped wearing under eye concealer, it always creases on me and looks no good. No matter the tricks. So If I look tired, then so be it. 

Green colour corrector to tone down any red in my dark skin tone. The red is not my undertone, but low level of irritation. 

Blush colours can make my look, didn't realise till this last year.... dark is good at night for drama... I will mix a bit of dark purple eyeshadow with my bronzer and use that low on my cheek, more of a coloured contour. Love it. 

Thinking of colours for the face as pigments and not eye shadow, blush blah blah. Allows me to get creative with my looks. Before I stayed well within the lines.... no fun and expensive.

"If you mean making use of the TOTP slots on the Yubikey to store those QR code tokens that you usually use with google authenticator, then yes you will loose the security that Yubikey would provide you. the reason the YK gives you security is that the private key information never leaves the YK, it just will make a code for you and that is all you get. If you also set that QR code up with an ordinary app on your phone, like Google Authenticator, then if your phone gets hacked, that information could be liberated and now you are hosed.


However if you are using an NFC YubiKey and you want to use the Yubico Authenticator app on your phone, it is still secure because that app is only querying your Yubikey for a fresh code for every entry you have set up on it, that one time that you go through the process. Again no secret info is released, the YK just generates the codes and passes those codes to the app so that the app can show them to you."

"I would think that a beacon system you would want to be visible to the maximum amount of players, so that you have the best chance of getting a response.  If I put a beacon down on Levski, you should be able to pick it up at Grim Hex.  I guess it depends on how they intend for beacons to work in the future though.  Are they just short-range burst transmissions or are they rebroadcast by a beacon network that everyone just picks up on their mobi?  Is the beacon the doorway between servers or is it limited to the one you are in?

"It‚Äôs definitely possible that they could have Ian get out in the finale, but if they have him get out and Mickey stays in I‚Äôll be pissed. Plus if they have him get out that seems like it‚Äôd warrant a bigger storyline than just one scene. Time wise they could make it happen. They could have him only in prison for a couple months if they counted the time he served in jail (9 months) towards his sentence, then use their favorite line of overcrowding/good behavior to account for the rest. 

The pic Noel posted is definitely a new pic, he‚Äôs wearing the same hoodie that he is in the pic of what I‚Äôm assuming is a deleted scene. They very well could have shot a scene of them in Mexico to fit with what the crew guy said. I just don‚Äôt see how Mexico makes sense story wise because Mickey turned on the cartel, would be a stupid idea for them to head to Mexico after that. But anything‚Äôs possible with this show. And I want nothing more than to see them together, happy and outside of prison.

"I don't think OP is for trans specific pronoun but just neutral so that he/she doesn't need to know what gender a person is or identifies as. Just using it f.ex. (or whatever they decide upon).

I don't think accomodating smaller groups is a bad thing. We should learn from the fact that there are actually smaller groups out there that doesn't conform to the groups that we have made, and then change to accomodate that. I'm not for a million different pronouns though, so having a neutral one would just simplify the whole process.

Why is he/she pronouns important though? I'm not sure it is adequate in our society today, simply because style sometimes makes it really hard to tell if it is a woman or a man. And names are not always enough to distinguish if it is a man or woman. Wether a person is biologically male or female doesn't really matter until your supposed to reproduce. Most of your interactions everyday is not about reproduction."

there's more of a theology aspect to the counter argument, because the counter argument isn't about biology or something that can be tested. it's about a professed belief in ones' identity. that evokes theology, faith, belief, those sorts of things."

I think it depends on what you like and want from your phone. I liked op6 for how clean and snappy the os is, Oxygen OS feels very close to stock Android which is great and it doesn't have unnecessary stuff. Note 8 on the other hand is absolutely packed with features like edge display, huge no notch display which is stunning (better than op6 imo), headphone jack, wireless charging, great multitasking features like double apps or a nicely done multiwindow - you can literally float them and move around and split screen works like a charm on a tall display. Spen is just something that doesn't have competition out there, has quite a lot of use like highlighting, drawing, signing your pdfs digitally or making quick notes any time.  Cameras on both are really good, especially that you can use gcam ports without rooting on both phones -trust me, regardless of your choice, get a gcam installed-much better than the stock cameras.

All in all I think note 8 has just much MUCH more use considering all the extras Samsung Experience brings but then again if you're a clean os person, you might be annoyed by double apps (Samsung and Google) and also, don't believe when someone says Samsung's skin is sluggish...these days are long gone, this device is a beast. For $300 that's an absolute bargain and hell of a value. OnePlus is slowly heading  towards that big flagship pricetag unfortunately and to me seems like their value is getting lost plus t versions are just minor updates."

"Regardless of finding ways to get exp from the metal slimes, I would remove that lower exp restriction. It's one of the ones I'd only do if I was doing an all-restrictions run because it's such an arbitrary restriction.

Using the advice about killing an enemy that nets exp in the regular battle to get around the restriction that you put in place kinda defeats the law of the restriction, even if not the spirit.

I really can't understand their logic here, but also, even if it works how it seems it should, you're still agreeing to sometimes waste effort in battles by gaining nothing but gold and maybe an item or two.

As a sidebar, since you can avoid almost every random battle in the game, you should just do that and only grind when you get beat to a pulp or when you discern it might be necessary to keep the challenge appropriate for your taste.

It's really just a protective feature that keeps you pretty prohibitively low-leveled just in case you still feel like fighting or need to grind materials or stuff like that."

"There is autoregulatory mechanisms in the brain that allow for an increase in cerebral blood flow in the setting of global hypoxia, e.g. increasing blood flow of low oxygen containing blood to the brain, to maintain a stable oxygenation level. Think of this as your body ""budgeting"" it's limited supply of oxygen and giving more to the brain by shipping more of it there. This as compared to lack of perfusion (e.g arterial blockage a.k.a. stroke) where even though the brain needs it, you can't ship any oxygen there, which leads to damage quickly.

I suspect they are trying to compare an anoxic/hypoxic situation to a lack of perfusion. In the setting of anoxia/hypoxia, the autoregulatory system with preferentially dilate cerebral vessels to improve oxygenation of these tissues, allowing it to survive better/longer than other organ systems. Though, of course, when prolonged enough, all organ systems will be damaged"

"Only a specific brand of it which is what I was trying to convey in my original comment. Trump is appealing to a specific strand of American national identity which is rooted in Anglo-Saxon whiteness and Christianity as opposed to the usual brand of American national identity which is rooted in a shared civic identity of being American. Essentially what I've been trying to say is that you (and many others in this thread) have been conflating the concept of chauvinism with the concept of nationalism when in reality chauvinism is merely nationalism taken to its extreme and patriotism, as you define it, is more often an expression of nationalism than it isn't given the fact that people who would identify as such often take for granted there being an amorphous ""American"" national identity and cling to the symbols of said identity such as the flag or the constitution."

"&gt; A person has a stroke and can't walk or talk propperly, they need round the clock care.

OK.

&gt; Cant contribute, pure extraction.

This is not necessarily ""pure extraction.""  People are fully capable of agreeing that any contributions to society (including those prior to their stroke) are made under the pretext of some sort of social safety net in the event of such crisis.  Take a simple practical example of an insurance company.  We both pay in... one of us has an accident and the company pays out... the pay out, the means to cover **what we paid in for** is not part of a surplus.  It is an anticipated cost.  Surplus is what is produced above and beyond costs.

&gt; More common? People produce differently, some simply do not do as much as others neither in time or ability...

True.

&gt; ...requiring a balancing in the form of extraction.

It's not clear why this requires ""a balancing in the form of extraction.""  Simply because I produce X and you produce .5X does not necessitate that we have not each produced enough to secure that which we are entitled to under some agreed upon right.

Using a simple one good economy, we can easily demonstrate how it does not necessarily require this.  Let's say that on average it requires 5 ears of corn per day to feed a person.  You produce on average 5 ears of corn per day and I produce on average 10.  There are two people.  We only need 10 ears of corn per day to subsist.  We have 15.  We are both given a right to 5 ears of corn per day.

Now in this case there _is_ surplus, but it does not need to be extracted to secure either of our rights.  I could simply work less to reduce the surplus and we would still have what we need.

&gt; By making everything a right you have removed most incentives to work meaning some will take that chance, requiring extraction.

What are you considering people's incentive to work here and why is it removed?

&gt; Im just wondering how you think a social right to something does not require some people to contribute for those that can't or won't.

That is not the claim I dealing with.  The claim I'm dealing with was a claim regarding **surplus** which seems to be founded in your misunderstanding of what surplus is.  Why people would contribute on behalf of those that can't or won't is not my concern.  That they can do so and no surplus needs to be extracted is my point.

&gt; Could you give me your utopian situation...

I'm not a Utopian, but I have provided examples above wherein surplus does not need to be extracted to secure rights.

&gt; ...where all labor time contribution and extraction is perfectly equal for every si gle person?

I said nothing about equality of contribution (in time or in physical product), nor does a system which secures rights to X require equality of contribution.  But neither does it require extraction of surplus.

You seem to be confusing a lot of issues and failing to understand basic theories of surplus labor and/or value."
"I think the final class that had torpedoes on were the Atlantas, but yeah, your point still stands. Not only were the torpedoes seen as liabilities, they also went against the American doctrine of having longer range engagements.

One of the main reasons for the Japanese installing torpedoes on their heavy cruisers was the emphasis of quality over quantity, as they knew they couldn't field a navy as large as the British or Americans, and so often armed their ships to the brims. Not only that, their initial strategy against the Americans was the Decisive Battle Doctrine, where they planned to lure the remaining battleship forces from Pearl Harbor in a chase across the Pacific, and have their cruisers and destroyers torpedo them before having the Yamatos finish the stragglers off. Unfortunately, not only did the Americans not chase them, but they completely changed their doctrine to a carrier based one, completely throwing their plans off."

So yes, Aang could teach someone to airbend, but then there would just be two airbenders. Katara can never learn to bend a second element because she can already waterbend."

"Damn, that's crazy bro. From what I remember from reading a few years back, he was shot in a car in front of his grandma's house. He went out to Upstate and stayed in a house up there to heal up and let the heat die down in the city, and started converting part of the house into a recording studio. I think it was... Power of the Dollar? - that he recorded up there. PoTD is one of my favorite albums of all time, but it never experienced a big proper release because powerful people in the NYC underworld and record biz weren't cool with how some of his lyrics came too close to naming real thugs and drug dealers and stuff. He was able to get it released as sort of a hand-distributed mixtape, but that shit should have made him famous. Dre and Em stepped in a couple years later and the rest is history. 

Side Note: You can't find Power of the Dollar for sale anywhere, and even youtube videos can be hard to find as they're sometimes purged by YouTuibe or maybe others.

Sunk cost fallacy. People have devoted time, effort and resources to this idea. They suffer under it and to admit it's fake would be to admit their efforts were in vain.


It is also interwoven into their cultures and is no longer simply a religion, but also a parasitic way of life.


They are fed misinformation constantly about their religion. An example being the Bible says no man or angel knows when the end is coming. Go and tell a Christian about an ""interesting"" end times prophecy and oh boy do they perk up and wouldn't you know it a pastor is organizing a caravan for the rapture right now. The Bible also says there is literally no evidence for the proof of God on Earth except in imaginary faith, but watch them pop a Christ boner at miracles or events/artifacts they feel the creator of the universe personally bent the rules for their proof.


What Christianity, as an example, has done is put God on both the ""there is no evidence of God"" , but also ""hooboy look at that evidence of God!"" sides of the argument. It makes indicating the belief is false troublesome, because the starting point of the individual is wildly flawed.


Christianity also have ""vaguebook"" posted the Bible enough that Christians mostly believe any sort of belief in God gets you in and no actions required, just accept Jesus. This membership gives you access to community, resources and connections that can financially benefit you and your offspring.


To top it off, Christians don't need to follow their own rules. They will always be able to find a faith with a lower standard, so losing membership is impossible. You'll also find Churches consistently hand out 3rd, 4th and fifth chances to individuals. You can get re-baptised and forgiven through confession quite a bit.


To top this off, if you're beating yourself up about your sins you're a dolt. Catholic priest molest what a million children globally? Evangelicals call for the cleansing of homosexuals (ahem, thou shalt not kill?) and many preachers live in the coffers of wealth, while their communities rot in squander.


It may simply be the belief in God is the golden ticket and only remedy for a Chocolate factory that rapes children, promotes HIV, suggests prayer and submission instead of therapy and imposes an impossible standard on forcefully ignorant individuals.


Religion benefits the cruel and excuse making exploiter, not the adamant follower of the faith. So what is left for them except imaginary friends and sky daddies?"

It seems like a double 6 would be best for him cos it looks like he really likes to express his mobility which means he needs freedom. As a double 6, he as the comfort of knowing someone will be back when he wants to gallop forward to make a tackle or a support run. But, maybe if Gini as the 8 in a 4-3-3 can act like a sort of support 6 and swap around with or cover for him then he could have a similar impact. He‚Äôll still be great as a 6 in a 4-3-3 but just naturally restricted. So, a double 6 with a 10 would be ideal for him(we also get to see Shaqiri and the front 3 if we keep going with this formation).

"Think of a balloon, which is totally strong enough to contain pressurized air and doesn't rip apart until you poke it with a pin, which gives a tear a place to start.  The tear then rapidly spreads through the material, which shows almost no ability to resist.  Or bubbles in champagne or soda or boiling water that form at tiny imperfections in the surface of the container.  A nucleation site is like the physical analog of a chemical catalyst, enabling a process that ""wants"" to happen but is difficult to start to actually start.

&amp;#x200B;

The surface of tempered glass wants to pull away from the interior, but can't get started doing so.  A tiny chip allows the surface to separate from the interior in that one spot, and the breaking apart in that one spot allows the glass to break apart in the neighboring spots, and in the blink of an eye you're standing in a pile of glass gravel."

"I've been doing this for 29 years. Work has a way of expanding and can occupy your every waking moment if you let it.

Don't burn the proverbial candle at both ends. You'll burn brightly and then you'll burn out.

I'm impressed that you're getting enough sleep. You already seem to have more common sense than I did when I was your age. When I was a first year teacher, I worked until bed time. My alarm went off at 5 AM and I'd be at work by 6 AM. I worked through the weekend, usually grading papers or writing lesson plans while watching TV. My social life was non-existent.

Things changed.

As I accrued more experience and slowly built up a nice collection of instructional units, lesson plans, quizzes, tests, enrichment activities, self-instruction modules, bulletin board displays and so forth, my life became easier.

It really helped that as I developed familiarity with teaching, it became easier to write lesson plans. Learning the pace of instruction and getting a feel for how long it would take to teach a lesson really helped. 

I was an elementary teacher for 17 years ... and then I burned out. 

I went back to school for my third degree and after graduating with honors in Culinary Arts, I worked in the food service industry for a few years.

When I returned to education as the chef instructor of a high school Culinary Arts program, it was almost like being a first year teacher all over again. I had no instructional resources other than the textbooks in my room. Everything I have now ... the powerpoint slides, the instructional units and lessons, the recipes, the hands-on production demonstration videos etc. all had to be created by yours truly. I've been teaching Culinary Arts now for 12 years and it's a lot easier than it was the first year I did this.

The people that want to be lied to want it so badly that they attack anyone who wants to point out reality and dissolve their fantasy.

""" I know a firm romantic rejection will crush him. That with a professional rejection from work he is so passionate about will really just destroy him.""

You have to firmly reject his romantic advance, so you're not giving him false hope. A firm rejection gives him the chance to move on. (Though it sucks he's put you in this position). 

Professionally, as long as he's doing what he's supposed to be doing in a professional manner, keep up with the business. Pull back on personal hang-outs, and keep discussions related to the business. If he's having trouble keeping up his end of the bargain, then talk about what to do (separate your business interests, whatever). Don't bring up his feelings again unless he does (then reject him again, and tell him not to discuss it with you again). Let him deal with his feelings privately, as long as he's behaving appropriately/professionally. Don't do the emotional labor of making his feelings your problem, unless HE makes them a problem by behaving unprofessionally."

"Joe **Morrow** was traded for Brendan **Morrow** (no relation).

Pittsburgh wanted a rental for the playoffs so they sent a B-level defensive prospect in Joe to pick up Dallas captain Brendan. Brendan crushed it in the regular season but didn't do so well in the playoffs as the Pens bowed out in the 2nd round. Brendan then signed with St. Louis in the offseason. Meanwhile, the Stars packaged Joe with several other players to land Tyler Seguin from Boston.

I'd say Dallas ultimately won the trade because of the Seguin factor but you could also call it a win-win as it was a solid gamble by the Pens."

Back in my day we had to touch our own screens!
"‚ÄúI know‚Äù I said.

This was my day. The day I died, and no matter what I said, Sarah never *let me go*. The first time she told me - I cried. All the years of her life ahead of her, all the perfect days she could still live, and she chose this one? No. It wasn‚Äôt right. It wasn‚Äôt fair. So, with tears in my eyes, I made the choice for her. I chose this day - my perfect day. It only ends if Sarah lets me go, for ""*I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.""*

Twenty-four hours ago, I sat nervously at the table. In front of me ‚Äì two buttermilk pancakes, dripping with maple-pecan syrup. It was our traditional Sunday breakfast, but this was likely the last Sunday here for a long time.

‚ÄúExcited?‚Äù Sarah asked, sipping her cappuccino.

‚ÄúMoving across the state to our new home? Who wouldn‚Äôt be.‚Äù I chuckled, tearing into the light, fluffy goodness that was the local college specialty. We were newlyweds, millennials, recently graduated, with new jobs near one another. It was almost a textbook love story, and we had our whole future ahead of us. I should have picked that day to get it right. I should have insisted we hire a moving company. I should have insisted we bring friends along to help carry furniture. I should have never agreed to take my grandfather‚Äôs desk, hand-carved in all its heavy, wooden majesty.

Instead, thirteen hours ago, the desk slipped from Sarah‚Äôs grasp. I was midway op the stairs, and it rode me to the bottom like some freakish rodeo, crushing my chest and neck, splitting open my jaw, bashing my head.

When the ambulance came, Sarah was sobbing in the corner, but the doctor‚Äôs insisted they had seen worse, and that I would be back to normal in a few days. She talked to me on the ambulance ride over. We considered using one of our days then, but did we need to? We had our lives ahead of us. What if one day the children we hoped to have got into an accident? What if something worse happened to use later, but we never had the chance to stop it - because we wasted our day, today?

I went into surgery, and the day passed. We missed our chance ‚Äì once a day has passed, it cannot be recovered. Those were the rules, strict and absolute.

So now I sit in the hospital bed, for another one of the many hundreds of times I have relived this day. Sarah ‚Äì bless her ‚Äì tries everything to save me. Nothing works. The bone fragment embedded in my heart ‚Äì it tears itself free before lunchtime, killing me in a matter of hours. It was a small thing to notice, and the doctor‚Äôs missed it. In another timeline I convinced Sarah to sue for malpractice. She still didn‚Äôt let me die.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you know?‚Äù Sarah asks. She is stuck in my day now, so she never relives these conversations, only me.

‚ÄúTell me, in all those times you tried to save me, did we ever go through our movie bucket list?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, we never did‚Äù

‚ÄúWell then ‚Äì let‚Äôs finish one,‚Äù I said.. This was how I‚Äôd spent the last 41 retries. I had over 200 movies I‚Äôve wanted to watch with Sarah, and if she isn‚Äôt going to let me go, then I‚Äôll be darned if I don‚Äôt finish.

‚ÄúBut I can save you.‚Äù She always says. ‚ÄúI know what‚Äôs going to happen, I just have to try something new.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, for once, stop trying to save me, and let me watch a movie with you. Please?‚Äù

‚ÄúOk,‚Äù she always responds, tears in her eyes, ‚Äúwhich one?‚Äù

‚ÄúHitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy.‚Äù

It was the 42nd movie on the list. I couldn‚Äôt help myself. A few hours pass and then it‚Äôs finished, Martin Freeman and Zooey Deschanel leave their boring world behind to explore the galaxy, and credits roll.

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù I ask, knowing the answer. I have a few minutes left; I grab Sarah‚Äôs hand.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Sarah replies, her voice choked and afraid.

This was new. Normally she calls for the doctor‚Äôs and tells them about the shard of bone in my heart. Was this it? Would the powers of Douglas Adams be enough to let me go? Surely not‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYour whole life will be an adventure. There will be times where you feel lost and afraid. There will be times when you have more questions than answers, and nothing can make understand, but you must keep going forward. Please, do this for me when i'm gone.‚Äù I said. Sarah broke down in tears. it was too late for any doctors now.

I felt it start - the pain; my vitals flare. I have a few more waking moments before the pain renders me unconscious. I close my eyes. I could keep them open, but I don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt want her to see me in pain.

I wonder if she will let me go. I hope she will. If not, then spending my last hours with my wife would truly be the perfect day."

People need to step back and look at what's really important and what these girls are trying to do. They just want to bring everyone together, get rid of all the hate and negativity, and just have an amazing time with each other. And they do a great job of this no questions asked. From what you've said and what others who were there have also said and just the way the girls performed, it looked like everyone was having the time of their lives and that's honestly so uplifting.

I don't feel at all invested in leaving anything for the future when I'm not here. I would rather spend resources on improving things in the present rather than the future.

I don't plan to leave a bunch of money to charity when I'm gone - I'm interested in giving it to them now.

Even the work I do with kids (I mentor a high school robotics club) I don't frame as a ""legacy"" in any way - I'm interested in improving their lives and sparking their imaginations today.

These things will definitely have an impact on the future after I've passed, but that doesn't really figure in to my thought process as far as why I decided to do them.

"&gt;Nationalism is not to be confused with patriotism. Both words are normally used in so vague a way that any definition is liable to be challenged, but one must draw a distinction between them, since two different and even opposing ideas are involved. By ‚Äòpatriotism‚Äô I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.

"&gt; Anyway, one of the key problems with any telescope with a spherical mirror is spherical aberration. In the case of an SCT, this is reduced through the use of two separate mirrors which complement each other in a manner that reduces the effect, as well as the longer focal ratio (which tends to decrease most aberrant optical effects). If you cut out the secondary, however, you have to do something to fix the problem.

As a matter of fact, it is the *Schmidt Corrector* that fixes the spherical aberration in SCTs, not the mirrors or combination thereof. The optics in fastar/hyperstar are just to fix the leftover off-axis aberrations and field curvature, which for F/2 mirrors is horrendously large."

"&gt; Ether the workers get the full value of their labor (socialism)

Socialism was never about workers receiving the exact value of their labor. It has always been about the abolition of private property and markets, and the organization of resource distribution according to needs/requests. If fruits of labor only went to workers, for example, and there were no means of trade, then there would be zero recourse for socially isolated unemployed children or seniors to receive any sustenance. Have you read or do you understand the economic forms of *any* socialist philosophers? 

&gt;""market value""

The scare quotes are unnecessary because market value has a definition and in capitalism, workers are paid wages equivalent or near to the price point of their labor.

&gt; Which is why we have people struggling to feed their families while the rich buy more yachts.

Wages based on the market value is not the primary cause of this. Regardless of wants and intentions, the rich buy yachts because they have generally received that wealth by gift or dividends or trading. People usually struggle to feed their families because a nation is poor, because they have had many children above the average especially due to unprotected sex, or because they personally are disabled, poorly educated, and most of all unemployed. The working poor are a minority, and it couldn't be any other way, because being unemployed directly causes poverty, while poverty is not directly and overall less causal of unemployment.

"Here is a [color image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Infantryman_in_1942_with_M1_Garand,_Fort_Knox,_KY.jpg) of an US Army infantryman wearing that uniform with a [M1917 Helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodie_helmet), which I think would be the basic uniform of National Guardsmen at the start, though likely subject to radical change.

If my ([limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_uniforms_in_World_War_II#Discontinued_Pre-War_Uniform_Items)) research is to be believed, this image might not be the best representation of what would be worn by new soldiers during the war because, when the Second World War started, the uniform was changed in order to conserve materials so you can expect the same to happen under the more severe circumstances of a civil war. For instance, this fellow is wearing a [campaign hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_hat), which was phased-out by the US Army during WWII outside of instructors and certain ceremonial usages in favor of the [garrison cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_cap) because the campaign hat used too much fur. In addition, the buttons at the time would have changed from brass to plastic for similar material conservation reasons, though that is a minor detail. You also saw things like the end of giving officers swords to conserve metal.

However, there is something that we will not be able to say definitively because these uniforms likely would see changes due to the need to prevent friendly fire. Three or four sides all using the same uniform would result in numerous blue-on-blue incidents during the early days of the war. As such, units may make impromtu additions and changes to the uniform to make them more visually distinct or manufacturers may change the color of the fabric to ensure that new combatants would look visually distinct from other combatants and add features such as armbands and other various color additions to help make their side visually distinct from the other three sides. After the 2nd ACW, though, you'd likely see efforts to create a new uniform that would (through the process of artistic license and Major Harold G. Sydenham just so happening to have always been on the winning side so his M1 Helmet gets made or an equivalent of him who converges on the same design as an improvement over the Brodie helmet) look like the standard U.S. Army M1943 Uniform with the M1 Helmet, though you could conceivably do an ""alternate history so it is different from the standard but is still an actual US Military uniform"" thing of having all the American units other than militia (who would still be wearing the old yet modified uniform) wear [M1942 Frog Skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog_Skin)."

"I can't believe I spent $400ish on a ""hard to find"" (rare) cloth diaper of a specific brand. Luckily, I sold it before the cloth diaper / babywearing market crashed. But a ton of people were collecting at the time and had to have them all. Now I laugh at my previous self.... but it was fun too! 

Edited to add: I used the same set of diapers on my twins  and now my singleton so realistically I still saved so much money by using cloth vs disposable. But no, I did not need that diaper. I never bought the most expensive diaper from that brand which at one point sold for 1000 USD."

"&gt;Doctor's used to perform house calls. This suggests that quality healthcare doesn't have to be as expensive as it currently is. 

Quality healthcare has changed massively. Use to be the doctor would examine you, guess then give you what you prayed wasn't snakeoil or poison. 

Today we expect just a little bit more from our MD. folks. We want actual drugs that work. That's expensive. We want doctors to not just guess, so radiology. That's expensive. We also like them to remain current, expensive. So on and so forth.

Note that limb damage can be fairly cheap. If you don't care about the above then there's some quacks who can slapped a cheap solution together.  Not sure I'd trust them, but cheap!

Reality is we love our advanced care, but advanced care is not cheap. Our society habit of suing the pants off anything that goes wrong doesn't help."

"That's all good, I'm fairly so-so with Rossi. I'd like to see #10 happen, but no more or less than I'd like to see Marquez do 10 championsips. Or Lorenzo or anyone else.

For Rossi though, the weird thing is, what you said about people who don't seem to put in as much effort but come out on top anyway, I would say usually get along better with that type of person than the type of person to stay up all night working. Why? I d'know, it's just who I am.

The thing is, I don't really consider myself a fan of any rider in particular. Also, there's no rider that I dislike, at all. I just like to see good racing. Personally, I don't like it how people beome super-fans of celebrities, or worse, actively hate them. But for me, it's interesting to think about why people do become such huge fans, and get such polarising attitudes.  And I honestly think it can't be argued on the internet why rider A is just the greatest, and rider B is a scumbag, because so much of it comes down to the things in common people think they have with them. 

I wrote the previous wall of text because that guy said ""Wow, how could anyone possibly have a problem with this guy?!"" but I think it's understandable how people can have a problem with any of them.

"The same thing was happening with my girls!  I heard that they tend to be pretty sneezy the first couple of weeks because they do have a sensitive immune system - and one of my girls had a similar squeaking cough.

I'd definitely monitor and do what that one commenter suggested with giving them some immune boosting foods.  I had to take mine to the vet, but only one needed a little extra love and care with some antibiotics.

I also found one of my girls was over-irritated with the Carefresh bedding I used, and I switched to a newspaper-based cat litter instead (which I see you've picked something super similar!), and that helped her immensely.  I just make sure to add lots of bedding materials they can use to make nests since that's not as soft.

Maybe, but there's something special about every human in game being a real person. "

The league you are placed in is based of the top 15 in your roster.

Even if one clan brings 15 Townhall 12s in another clan brings 15 Townhall 8s they could still be matched together because they are in the same league.

No, what's short sighted is to ban plastics to try to ""clean up"" the garbage we send to Asia because we know the garbage we are exporting aren't being properly recycled... 

How about instead of banning plastic we scale up our EU recycling centers - which do a good job of taking care of the plastics - and stop sending garbage to third world countries were we know it wont be properly recycled? 

Our garbage is full of a lot of other nasty crap, not just plastic, and that needs to be taken care of via proper recycling - to keep sending that to Asia, were we know it still wont be properly recycled, that seems to me to be the definition of short sighted... 

You're just setting yourself up for the next ""*OMG this crap XXX is in our garbage and is causing harm to the environment, because we keep sending our garbage to Asia where they don't recycle it!*"".

I've heard of people doing that kind of stuff. If I remember correctly, the most important merit is to have a good enough job lined up before you move, and also a clean rap sheet. I won't comment on the imploding country, other than that if I bothered to ask my university, they'd print me a MA in North American Studies, with a focus on US politics."

"When you identify the answer to this question you'll understand why I said what I said, and why I'm right.

Bob and Jim make the same amount of money per year, same expenses, lifestyle, etc.

Bob takes out a mortgage and buys a house for $100k and with any spare money each month he invests it into an index fund in the stock market.

Jim keeps being told that houses are great investments, takes a mortgage out and buys a house for $200k and with any spare money each month he invests it into an index fund in the stock market (obviously less spare than Bob).

Fast forward 20 years: **who has the higher net worth?**

Here's another question for you: What if I told you that instead of the index fund that you invest now, which pays dividends annually of about 2% and historically grows at 8-9% before inflation, I could find you an asset that is:

1) Extremely illiquid

2) Pays no dividend

3) Grows historically at around the rate of inflation

4) Requires constant maintenance

5) You have to pay an annual tax equal to .5-3% of the entire value of the investment

Still think homes are a good investment?"

"Okay, I guess I have to intervene. Osama bin Laden was Saudi, just like 15 out of the 19 terrorists that carried out the 9/11 attacks. (Nationalities of the rest were Iraq, Lebanon and UAE (2x).)

The war in Afghanistan was justified by two things. The first was to find Osama bin Laden, who was the primary suspect for having planned the attack, was believed to be hiding there there. At the time, al-Qaida had not taken responsibility for the attacks, and there was no concrete evidence to the public that bin Laden was in fact in Afghanistan. But it was known that al-Qaida was operating within Afghanistan.

The Taliban-led Afghan government agreed to [hand over bin Laden via a third country](https://web.archive.org/web/20130628053351/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/17/afghanistan.terrorism11). The US refused this offer and decided to go to war to find bin Laden themselves. The Taliban government fell on December 6, 2001.

The second reason was to do with liberating the women of Afghanistan. To be fair, Afghanistan was probably the worst place in the world to be a girl. The Taliban sucks.

With this in mind, recall that the US claims to have found Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011. Again, there is no concrete proof to this as bin Laden is said to have bin killed an his body dumped in the ocean. But either way, almost a decade went past in the search for bin Laden, and he was found not in Afghanistan, but in Pakistan, which is well known for its compliance and cooperation with the US and China.

With that being said, the objective of finding Osama bin Laden and ""bringing him to justice"" through the war in Afghanistan failed. The objective of helping the women of Afghanistan was also not exactly successful. And the meager stability that can be had there at the moment is bought at a very dear price.

Now, let's look at the justifications for continuing the war. The sentiment in your comment is that ideologies like that of the Taliban's project power outside the confines of Afghanistan, and therefore cannot be tolerated. This is false, as far as I know. The Taliban itself had no ambitions or ability to project power outside of Afghanistan.

So the remaining reason is to prevent Afghanistan from becoming free land for rich Wahhabist groups, similar to how Iraq and Syria became taken over by mercenaries combined with terrorists after Iraq was abandoned. These groups *would* have the ambition, and perhaps even the ability, to project power outwards. So this is a very real danger.

However, more importantly, the US is worried to give Iran and Russia more influence in Afghanistan, which is what would happen if the US pulled out. Iran and Russia are already rebuilding a lot and have much closer language and cultural ties to the Afghan people.

In closing, let's discuss the true motives that a terrorist might have in attacking the US. Consider the actions of the US in the past 17 years that you are already familiar with. The US invaded Afghanistan and Iraq. As we have seen, the war in Afghanistan failed and the objective itself was dubious and ill-defined at best. The war in Iraq, which was to stop Saddam Hussein from using weapons of mass destruction, also failed, since Iraq did not have any weapons of mass destruction (just as international inspections had shown).

Now consider that the US has an absolutely outstanding intelligence service, with very good ties to excellent intelligence services in Europe as well as the rest of the world. Is it plausible that US intelligence made an honest mistake? Is it reasonable to start a war over *alleged* possessions of ""some sort"" of weapon of mass destruction... and by ""some sort"" I mean something that at worst could be a dirty bomb, a yellow cake device or perhaps a chemical weapon, not anything remotely resembling a nuclear warhead.

To most of the world's population, it is not reasonable at all. Most people think that the US knew perfectly well what they were doing in starting these wars. This is all happening half a continent away, so they don't have to deal with the chaos that ensues. It's Russia, Iran, India and Europe who has to clean this shit up, and in the meantime you get military bases all surrounding Iran, and better control over parts of the hydrocarbon resource market by extension.

Now, are these perks really worth it for keeping these wars going? Frankly I don't know, it would take a good economist to answer that. But my gut feeling is no.

But that doesn't matter. What matters is that that's the way most of the world's people feel about the US: an imperialist state that goes to war for resources and somehow believes that it still has the moral highground.

Now, backtrack to before 9/11. It is often said that ""the world changed"" that day. Yeah, the world changed for the US. For the rest of the world, nothing changed. The US is always tangled up in some wacky scheme to exert power, such as when they toppled Iran's democracy. They're always in some military conflict either directly or indirectly, and justifications for these wars is the the same bucket of bullshit every time, and every time they end up ""losing"" by which I mean not attaining their stated objectives. When they're not invading Vietnam they're arming Saddam Hussein, when they're not arming Saddam Hussein they are training Osama bin Laden (which may be true or untrue in that case specifically), and when they're not doing that then they sell billions of dollars worth of weapons to Saudia Arabia.

Again, Saudi Arabia. The *headquarters* of Wahhabism and the second most oppressive place for women, that is currently in war in Yemen."

There are exceptions to this though. Picard played his flute from the alien probe. I'm pretty sure that was an original composition.

Maybe you could interpret Trek's interest in classical music or jazz to simply be a cultural preference. People in the 24th century may have a preference for ""natural"" music rather than all the synthetic or electric sounds that are popular nowadays.

So immediately, then. 

I understand that many believe there is an incarceration problem in America, and in some instances, it's true. But, and this is a big but, what if instead of the only problem being malicious and vindictive prosecutors, there were actually bad people out there, who do bad things, who need to go to prison for those bad things. 

I think it's possible in our rush to a solution to socioeconomic problems caused by incarceration, we are turning a blind eye to the underlying factors that lead to the incarceration, and the circumstances and legal framework that created those underlying factors. 

Crime is complex, and the justice system is a very blunt instrument with which to enact social change. Looking to it to solve problems has been a century long legislative copout, and looking at it dissolve is just the same. Historically, education level and crime have an inverse correlation; perhaps we should focus our legislative efforts there as well. "

"Right, but the entire loot system is a part of that problem.  

The current loot system is as old as many of the other systems in the game itself. The game has evolved since then, with movement, combat, damage, and even outright new systems being added atop of it. The fact that things can be lost permanently because of glitches and the like is counter-intuitive to a player friendly game. It's safe to say that a loot system designed around other systems as a whole is one that needs reworked and fixed.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to come down on DE or Warframe as a whole. They have done AMAZING work to this game, But EVERY system needs to be brought up to speed, looting included. The current loot system does not compliment the fast paced nature of the game. 

Also, why do you keep taking one of my arguments per post out of context instead of addressing the post as a whole?"

"Church music, light, falling Bean.  Ok here I go:

Bean was well dressed in his way to church, and stopped to admire his duds in the reflection of a window.  His hat blew off and got stuck on top of a streetlamp, right in front of the church.  The church was undergoing roof repairs (arent they always) and he sneaks up to the tall scaffolding when the worker is distracted.  He steals the tall ladder, effectively leaving the worker trapped.  He approaches the streetlamp and realizes that the ladder is not a freestanding type and the streetlamp is too narrow to set the ladder on effectively.  He attempts to set the center of the top rung against the top of the streetlamp and it goes okay until he is halfway up.  Finally he decides the only thing he can do is balance the ladder upright, leaning against nothing, and climb very carefully.  Amazingly, he slowly makes his way up!  Then he leans out to grab his hat, his hand covering the light sensor and causing the lamp to turn on... and that's when the church service began.  He turns to face the source of the music, forgetting that his ladder isn't leaning against anything."

"This guy is most likely suffering from a condition called ankylosing spine, or bamboo spine. It happens when the vertebrae in your spine fuse together. It can be a genetic condition or due to years of horrible posture. If it was solely postural related and fixable I doubt it would have progressed this far. It starts with a Dowagers hump and is downhill from there. 

If you have a dowagers hump and are under 35, you need physical therapy, a postural sling, muscular reeducation, and a strengthening program before it becomes irriversible.

"I think there's little if anything to learn from a blow out. The player never had the space they needed to even begin performing their role for us to evaluate. I just got out of a gane on King's Row where I went Ana and then they picked Mei, Zarya, McCree, Hanzo, Symmetra. We got through the first choke maybe twice and no other hero pick from me would have turned that game around no matter what. I slept a few of their players during shield drops from fire strikes, got in some anti nades, healed my team when possible but it was generally unhealable damage...and then we finally lost and I got to move on with my life. None of my teammates comboed ults or did anything worthwhile.

That vod wouldn't show you anything about how I play Ana except that sometimes you just have to sit back and say gg go next and hope you get people who didn't queue comp thinking it was quick play.

You need a close game to review because it means picking out mistakes from this one single player would have a big potential impact on the entire game.

Meanwhile no advice in the world for me in that King's Row match would have changed the outcome, so all I come away with from a VOD review is general tips instead of key mistakes in distinct moments that I can learn from."

Hello and welcome to Knife_Swap! Please read this entire message if this is your first time posting here!

Make sure you obey any laws that are applicable to your country and the recipients country. If we find out that you are breaking them we will ban you.

As a reminder, all posts require a timestamp with the knife open and the blade visible.  This is a picture of the knife with your handwritten username and the date to prove you possess the item in question. Additionally, please make sure to have a grade:

Quality [Q] Levels (use + or - accordingly):

* ""A"" - New, has been taken out of the box a few of times, never used to cut or been carried
* ""B"" - Light wear, been carried, non damaged. Sharpened by someone who knows what they're doing (aka not most of us).
* ""C"" - Moderate wear on handle or blade, may have been reprofiled, sharpened not super well, modded in any way, need sharpening; mechanisms (non lock related) may not function properly
* ""D"" - Things are broken.


Until you have successfully completed a sale or trade, you can only post one knife at a time. This means one thread, one knife, and that's it. NO EXCEPTIONS  

Once you successfully have completed and got trader flair a sale or trade, you can post however many knives for sale as you want! Please still try to keep them all in one post, though, to avoid spamming our page.  

Please make sure your prices aren't ridiculous.  You will be called out if you're asking an unreasonable amount.

Your prices should also be in the form of Paypal Goods and Services, with any fees added.  All your prices should include the shipping costs, unless international shipping is requested by the buyer. 

Any ""Want to Buy"" threads should use the weekly stickied ""WTB"" thread.  If you're looking for a Price Check, please use the stickied ""Still Available / Price Check"" thread.  

If you're looking to sell EDC gear, that's fine to do here as long as there are more knives in your post than gear. 

As always, please don't be a dick.  Message the mods if you have any questions!

"Vyanse is an c2 medication.  Per my understanding they do not have a requirement to use home delivery on controlled substances where you will suffer a cost increase.  The cost is probably related to just retail vs home delivery instead where its cheaper over 90 days, or you benefit gives you a big cut to use home delivery.  That is your insurance fault though at that point.  Call them inquire to see if they also have a local 90 day pharmacy option at like Walgreens or CVS.  They have steadily been opening up there network depending on the policy to allow for it and allowing you to pick up a 90 day with costs similar to mailorder. "

2 15 oz cans tomato paste

2 15 oz cans petite diced tomatoes

1 16 oz. can whole jalape√±o peppers, drained and sliced

1 cup frozen corn

1-2 tablespoons chili powder (I think 1 1/3 is perfect, to not overwhelm the jalape√±o)

1 tablespoon cumin

1. Heat oil in skillet over medium heat.  Place turkey in the skillet and cook until brown.  Pour turkey into slow cooker.
2. Add the onion, peppers, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, beans, jalape√±os, corn, chili powder and cumin.  Stir.
3. Cover and cook on High for 4 hours or on Low for 6 hours.  Serve with toppings (green onions, shredded cheese, avocado sour cream) if desired (but I like it just the way it is.

"The guy said 

&gt;I think most people don‚Äôt understand what happened here. The phones slowed down because the batteries were nearing end of life and wouldn‚Äôt hold charge for very long otherwise.

&gt;The real fault here is the companies not warning about battery health.

Basically saying there was no planned obsolescence but rather they slowed the phones  because of the battery issue.

You told the guy he needs to read it and he responded by saying that there was no planned obsolescence and when the battery was replaced the issue was fixed

&gt;I did. There‚Äôs no evidence at all of ‚Äúplanned obsolescence‚Äù, that‚Äôs just what the European regulators decided to pat themselves on the back about.

&gt;In fact, if you had one of these phones you‚Äôd know the problem disappeared as soon as the batter was replaced. 

You responded with an argument against his by quoting this from the article

&gt;In a statement the antitrust watchdog said ‚ÄúApple and Samsung implemented dishonest commercial practices‚Äù and that operating system updates ‚Äúcaused serious malfunctions and significantly reduced performance, thus accelerating phones‚Äô substitution‚Äù.

Perhaps you're confused what the guy is arguing but he's referring to the planned obsolescence claim not the fine. 

Pushing an update that is focused on the new phones and as a byproduct slows older phones down is not planned obsolescence. pushing an update with he specific purpose of slowing down older phones to make customers buy newer phones is planned obsolescence.  Pushing an update that slows the older phones down for a specific reason like the battery thing is not planned obsolescence though they should have informed people why it was happening which is pretty much what he was saying in his original comment. Had it been planned obsolescence instead of a battery issue then the phones would not have gotten faster when you replaced the battery."

An Islamic extremist committed the single deadliest incident in 2017: the New York City vehicle ramming attack killed eight people. Left-wing extremists and those who didn‚Äôt fall in the previous two categories carried out the other 3% of deaths. 2017 was the second year in a row in which black nationalists committed murders in the US.

You are 26 times more likely to be murdered by a right wing terrorist than a left wing terrorist."

"When I was in my last year of undergrad, I was told in no uncertain terms that a PE is a waste of time unless you're trying to work in government, civil, or environmental engineering, and I've found that to be largely true (in California). The only person I know that bothered works for the power company; I was never asked about it in the course of interviewing and was (obviously) never required to have it. I'm OK with this by and large, but then I see stories like that guy in Oregon who complained about the traffic lights and I start worrying. That being said, I think the system as it is benefits from the large number of engineering graduates who (like me) give zero fucks about it, and would not be feasible if everyone who works in any engineering capacity were forced to be licensed."

THE SECRET is to boil the noodles, drain them, put the noodles in the sauce pot and let them absorb the flavors. Serve with crusty toasted bread. You can even get a pack of frozen sausage (a cured sausage will last forever in the freezer) and take one out at a time when you make spaghetti and use it in the sauce. Real cheap and real good!"

Clearly I didn't catch the likely very brief period where people were discussing it not having been implemented. I don't do an absurd amount of daily research, so I'm unlikely to ever noticeably hit the cap if it IS there. What reason is there for me to have assumed it wasn't implemented? Especially considering it would be a very logical cause of this particular problem.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I knew, it was implemented. I'm not going to apologize for not doing deep fact checking on something like this. It's a simple change that didn't really affect me. Why would I have been eagle-eyedly watching for news of it? (And it's a simple enough change that there was no reason to ever assume they'd drop it.)"

"Well, let's say the $140M boost in sales came exclusively from the Go. That's not likely at all, but let's say it did. That means they sold about 230k of their most mainstream product.

But as I've said before, the Go is a test run for the next version that will have smaller bezels, longer battery life, and better performance - which I think will have a big effect on sales. "

"I think it's a real problem in our culture that you are made to feel defensive about your valid thoughts and feelings about this issue. In 99% of cases, being overweight or obese **is a behavior**. It should be viewed no differently than a spouse who refuses to maintain basic hygiene or refuses to adequately contribute to the housework. 

When those bad behaviors of a spouse are described here, it is almost universally condemned by the r/Marriage community. But when it comes to the behavior of ""letting yourself go,"" that is something that a spouse like you just needs to accept. Something deeper about the human psyche is being revealed in the community's response. It just seems like there is foundational assumption among many people that once they get married and have kids, they've achieved the primary goals in life and therefore no longer need to stay fit and attractive for their partner.

This also is a perfect example of a situation where ""communication"" is not the community's accepted trite answer. Over and over and over again, the main response to the posts of r/Marriage is that ""you guys need better communication."" Yet, the advice you get on this particular topic is to not communicate your feelings."

"Hey Team! I suppose this question isn't confined to just Tomo, but I'm interested in how you all are thinking about this. A narrative is taking hold in the marketplace that the base chain isn't really where the bulk of everyday transactions will occur. In Bitcoin for example, the conversation and bleeding edge development (Schnorr sigs aside) has shifted to layer 2 solutions, as Bitcoin continues to ossify and become more secure as a settlement layer. You can argue that with Ethereum's layer 2 solutions on the horizon, something similar will start happening there. That's without mentioning the fact that Ethereum is also incorporating sharding and PoS to improve scalability on the base chain.  

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of all the bells and whistles like sharding, how do you realistically plan to upstage crypto's two biggest players - Bitcoin and Ethereum - who are just now starting to 'solve' the scalability problem through layer 2 solutions and their own scalability improvements? It's easy to say that your solution is better because of the TPS, or that there's room in the market for multiple players, but if the current trend is moving towards the acceptance of layer 2 solutions, then the base layers will mostly serve to secure the network. That means the most secure base layer will attract the lion's share of dapps and other applications. And no chains are more secure than Bitcoin and Ethereum, for payments and programmable contracts, respectively. What's your take on all of this? Thanks!"

"It tries to, but it's so easy to drop in or out of shards (world quests, partying with friends, deciding to log or do some non-open world activity) that it's a real challenge to keep them balanced, and having more bodies available means that whenever a horde player or group leaves a shard, another will replace them in short order.  The same is not true of an Alliance group or player, which leaves them at a local disadvantage.

Ask any questions, you may have. Since you're not overclocking, I wouldn't put a non-stock cooler, but the one that comes with the Ryzen 7 2700X is RGB. It's all black (technically the gpu is grey, but the part through the window is black. It's got room for more RAM down the line, for something like video editing. Since you're not overclocking, this CPU is pretty much the exact same as an i9, just cheaper. If you want me to add windows, I can. You'll be able to have the ultimate gaming experience in 27"" 1440p with G-Sync. I mean, you could probably even game in 4k with that."

Poor drafts and very little moves in FA leaves the team with very little talent.

Daniels , haha, Baluga, Cobb, Blake, Jimmy average to above

Then you have a bunch of below average players.

This team needs to rebuild the roster. And I think that is why they are not trading away their picks right now. They want to use them to hopefully rebuild. Maybe trade back the first rounders for some seconds.

Also, make sure the individual pieces are placed on the strip of tape tightly so that ZERO slack exists between the pieces. 4) check out the sawing pattern mentioned in 52 boxes, having the perfect grain wrap feels so good.

"Maybe, maybe not. Most trucks are designed to ride well empty, and yours has the capacity for lots of cargo. When you add that cargo, the springs take up the weight, but the rear sags a bit in response. The air bags don't change the carrying capacity of the truck, but they do give you the option to level the truck when heavily loaded. Yours might be fine, you won't know until you attach your rig and see how much it affects the trim of your truck. In my case, a weight distributing hitch worked well with my travel trailer weight, but the air bags worked better (even though the weight was well within the capacity of my truck). A 5th wheel is much heavier, and there's no option for a WDH. Thus air bags. "

"For me, there must be some visual.

Let's compare it to reading a book. Some people afterwards remember it all completely, names, story, every detail. Even weeks later. While other people might only remember the story and some names of the head characters. And then you also have the people who can happily read a book again after some time because completely forgot everything. And then while reading might think ""hmmm I think I've read it before because this person died right at this part with a knife"".


So that person dying is a specific part I somehow did remember and put in my head somewhere because it's crucial. Is it visual? I don't know. Remembering how someone looks for me are some crucial bits, like black hair, kind eyes, red lipstick, purple glasses. But I often don't know anymore if a guy is bald, because a lot are and I don't save it anywhere. But I do somehow remember his purple glasses. Will I be able to draw his face, or the glasses? No! Do I know or can visualize if the glasses are round or square? No because I have no clue what they look like but the purple stood out.

So it's not hearing, it's not clear seeing. But it's somehow still a not so clear visual memory.

(with people and memories it can be very frustrating, I've introduced myself 4 times to the same girl in a year because she had such common features that nothing stood out for me to remember. It's not a nice thing to do and awful to try to explain) "

"All are messages I'm getting from the DSM notfications. The message is the volume/storage pool has crashed, which is on one expansion unit. Somewhat ironic in all of this is that the other expansion unit, which also had drives are not in the compatible list and some that were on the incompatible list has never had any issues. According to the DSM the array, (I should clarify message is that it loses connection to the UPS). At first I took this to mean that it somehow disconnected UPS and had no power, but it could also mean that it it isn't communicating with the array. I was also leaning toward a power supply issue. In my experience, I've had very few hard drives actually fail but quite a few more power supplies fail. 

I don't have any cross unit volumes. 

The reason that I'm thinking the drives are not to blame is that I got the impression if the the expansion unit was still under warranty, they would replace it, but since it is not I'm told that I should replace all the drives. 

I have been removing drives that are supposedly bad and replacing them with drives that are on the Synology compatibility list for the respective units. However, support tells me that the drives need to be on compatibility for both the expansion unit and main unit, and to be clear the lists are different. None of the drives that I have installed are on both compatibility lists. To do so would cost me $3,000 (for all the drives in the array) and, according the Synology Support, that could fix my issues. 

Furthermore, nowhere on the website does it say that drives need to for expansion units and main units need to be on both compatibility lists. Because of this, I'm skeptical of veracity of the support agents' claim. Although today, they emailed me to say they are talking to their website designers about it. "

"The other side..

A woman will be ambiguous to a guy she's not interested in is because she wants him to pursue her anyway for social proof. 

Girl who isn't interested: ""I'm not looking to get in to a relationship right now""

Guy: &lt;thinking ""she said right now. I need to wait and come in at the right time""&gt;

So a month later he flirts with her again at a party.  She says something else ambiguous.  She doesn't give a fuck that he's a 5. It makes her look good in front of her friends if 'she can't get rid of another lovable loser'. It doesn't matter what he does, it's going to be more social proof for the girl. All she has to do is balance it by laughing at him more with her girlfriends in accordance to how low his SMV is, or that he's simply making a fool out of himself no matter what his SMV is [was], no mater what his HB is. If he went nuts and declared his love to her on a stage in front of the whole high school. She will come out looking good.

"*A referral to a psychiatrist (free via OHIP)*

Psychiatrists *may* provide 45-60 minute sessions, *may* provide different forms of therapy like CBT, MBT, schema therapy. They can also prescribe medications and antipsychotics like Abilify and Seroquel can be used for aggression/agitation. 

*psychologist (not covered by OHIP, may have limited sessions with work benefits*

A psychologist will generally perform tests like the Beck Anger Inventory. It's a rating scale. They will definitely provide CBT or other forms of therapy but it can be dependent on their preferences and training. You can usually just call some to ask if they are taking new patients. 

*Catholic/Jewish Family Services - free, walk-in type place and you don't need to have any religious affiliation to go*

These places are usually staffed by social workers, and they will give you much of the same things as a psychologist will. They can't however diagnose a person. That's a doctor's role. These places will have resources if they feel they can't help, like a referral to the Royal Ottawa Hospital. 

Don't underestimate the ability to control anger on your own (the person you're asking about). Yoga, and especially meditation are proven to help with mood. There are so many great books out there that talk about all things brain related. Gabor Mat√©, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Bren√© Brown are some great people to read/watch TED talks of.

They can also look into DBT, which is a program intitally for people with Borderline Personality Disorder, but has, over the years, been applied to other patients. It's skills-based, and teaches people how to regulate their own moods. There are two programs - one out of the Royal Ottawa and one from the Canadian Mental Health Association. Both need referrals and possibly an actual diagnosis of some kind, but a lot of people find the workbook for DBT on its own pretty helpful. 

Being aware is a first step, so the fact that this person knows they need help is great. I am almost out of battery power but I can add to this post later if needed.

Good luck!

"&gt;If the other person does not have PGP/2FA set up it will not work

Actually, I just tested it out. Out of curiosity, I created an account that uses PGP and one that doesn't use PGP (both allowed use of weak passwords, by the way. FYI). They were able to send messages to one another without any issues, alerts, or warnings. This was with the ""use encryption whenever possible"" checkbox enabled. This is a very serious security vulnerability on your site. 

When you say ""do it manually,"" I assume you mean by manually encrypting the messages, transmitting the ciphertext using your messaging platform, then having the recipient decrypt it. Frankly, this is the method I would recommend people use on your site, since I can't confirm that the automatic encryption function actually works, since the ""encrypted"" messages are actually received in cleartext by a non-enabled user.

I never saw any sort of outrage or significant complaints about the show which just seems so weird when everyone seems to think black face is always unacceptable. Is it just because it's a tv show? Because they take the piss out of how racist it is in the show? When does black face for the sake of humour become acceptable. Also there's Tropic Thunder but I've never seen that so I don't know about that. It just seems like black face is selectively ignored at times but with no sort of consistency to it. "

"I don't wanna be *that* guy, but what if this is a *False* False Flag. If I was Putin and I wanted to completely fuck with the elections, I'd want to frame Dems as un-votable by validating the Conservative 'False Flag' narrative. You send out some bombs, wait for everyone to get outraged, but you leave a carefully laid-out trail so that in a few days, it turns out that it was ""actually"" Democrats who did this. Then it becomes international news that *the libruls truly are a violent mob! Trump was right all along!!1*

Something to keep an eye out for.

EDIT: **I'm not suggesting this is a False Flag by the Dems** you dicks. Just that if this a set-up by the people who want Trump in power, it would effectively validate every right-wing commentator's False Flag obsession. Every gun victim would be written off as an actor, every sexual assault victim would be written off as a liar, and every scandal involving Trump would be happily written off as a conspiracy.

And I felt the same way about my breeder! I didn't expect to get the sense of community and support from the experience of getting a dog from a breeder. It's a really welcome surprise. Out of curiosity, why did you get him at 6 months? Potential show boye that didn't turn out?"

"I'm a bit worred about the state of AI. Sure, plenty of different enemy variants, but none of them have personality. They just stand there and shoot at you, occasionally chuck a grenade, repeat.

If we are going to team up with a bunch of our friends, the AI needs to more on point / dynamic.

"General surgeon here.

Larger people have larger organs in general for the reasons listed above, I‚Äôve never read any studies on it, it‚Äôs just what I see at work.  The cavities in your bodies adjust to the need for the organs IN MOST SITUATIONS.

Symptomatic Pectus excavatum is a good example of what happens when it doesn‚Äôt.   

And what happens when you have more space that needed?  Well most spaces have atleast once size that is soft tissue that will decrease in size.  But, for instance, in brain atrophy like in old dementia patients or alcoholics, the brain is actually a little ‚Äúloose‚Äù, and can slosh more.  Fluid will fill around it.  You‚Äôre body never fills empty cavities with air, it‚Äôs always fluid if anything.

Here‚Äôs another example.  In the abdomen sometimes we have to do really big surgeries like remove half the organs for a big cancer.  At the end all we do is close the abdomen as normal.  The the abdominal cavity will slowly shrink down some, all air will be absorbed (can take a month if open air, just a few days if laparoscopic).  They may get a little extra fluid in their abdomen.

In terms of ‚Äúmaking space‚Äù. People have lots of extra space inside them, especially in the abdomen.  As people get fat, they can store so much fat inside their abdomen.  So, so much.  It can make my job very difficult.

Even on fat people, I‚Äôm talking like BMI of 60, I can still put around 3-4 liters of air in the abdomen to do laparoscopic surgery.  The inside of their abdomen will expand with their need for space as long as the need for space happens slowly (over months, not over days.  Google abdominal compartment syndrome‚Äô for what happens if they need a lot of space over days).

Hope that makes sense.  I added paragraphs out of order so hopefully didn‚Äôt repeat myself too much 

Edit: to the dude that says that air is also a liquid and I should use the word ‚Äúfluid‚Äù.......get a life.   Good lord "
"Meeting in person will make things a lot harder. I recommend you only meet in person if you absolutely know you want to continue the relationship, whatever that means whether it's traveling the world with him or something else.

"A lot of backup files from servers and such can be very big, but that is kind of a cheap option since most everyday people don't handle such large recovery files that often.

"It's a colloquial abbreviation for ""hydraulic fracturing"".

&gt;Hydraulic fracturing, technically, is just one step in the many stage process of getting oil and gas out of rock formations deep underground. Engineers and scientists use the term hydraulic fracturing‚Äîshortened to hydrofracking, fracturing, or just plain fracking‚Äîto mean this very specific activity. Hydraulic fracturing is the step in the process that involves injecting large amounts of water combined with ‚Äúfracking fluids‚Äù and proppants (sand and other solids) down a wellbore. Fractures in the rock are created that allow the oil and gas to migrate up the well, where they can be captured"

"Some people do because they identify with them. Some people are a bit murderous naturally and find themselves highly attracted to people that have the courage, for lack of better word, to actually go out and do what they want.

It's not just school shooters, I'm almost positive these same people idolizing school shooters have a morbid fascination with at least one well known serial killer or murderer.

The fascination at times can be with the act of murder itself, or with the thrill of the shock factor behind it all, or for some going down in history as the most brutal of mass shootings has appeal.

Most people who admire school shooters will never go on to commit the same, but as for why they like them, well there's several reasons. I think top of the line though, is in some twisted way these people become their hero's and they feel a kind of connection with them because they were able to release their inner rage and frustration and able to kill the people they wanted to see dead.

Unfortunately as a young child I ""fell in love"" with the Columbine shooters. I was in 5th grade and if I'm being totally honest I have no idea what exact thing about them even caught my attention beyond the initial horror people expressed when it first happened. But it dawned on me that hey these kids killed the kids they hated *I* can kill the kids *I* hate! It was like the most freeing revelation for my young impressionable mind.

I quickly and I mean very quickly became absolutely murderous in my rage. I *hated* with deep body shaking hatred all my imagined ""enemies"" and felt great frustration that I had no gun to kill them with. I played with the idea of just stabbing them but never acted on it. 

This desire to kill lasted off and on from about 9 years of age in 5th grade until about 22 years old. Due to exploring Christianity I let that part of myself die because I realized I couldn't claim Christianity like I wanted yet still want to kill people, the two could never coexist and I'm now 27 and haven't had a single desire in that area since.

I can't explain why some people go on to commit school shootings, or why some people become serial killers. Some times certain people who perhaps already have some sort of predisposition or special circumstance, like being mercilessly bullied and no one that *should* help will help, feel a sense of power at the thought of simply removing the source of their problems, and in such a way that the people you're doing it to know *exactly* why you are doing it. It's pretty much the vilest, most successful way to get your point across. 

Personally I felt ignored, overlooked, in addition to feeling justified in my hatred of all the bad kids in my school. In my mind I would be doing my teacher's a favor so they wouldn't have to struggle with them anymore.

To be frank there was a million and one reasons going through my head why I wanted to do it. 

I don't know why some of us are sick in our minds and feel sudden connection to murderers or why other's instantly recoil at even the idea of killing another human, but I do know it wasn't something I could really help. I was too young to realize I needed outside help to get over it and too angry with the people I wanted dead, and at the world to even *want* to be fixed.

Now at 27 I realize it's absolutely horrible, I've realized it since I hit my teens and came into my reasoning abilities, but I never took any real steps to do anything about it until the last few years.

I am thankful I'm passed it and even if it were to come back I know if I haven't done it yet having full ability to get a gun and do so I'm not going to. I am just as sure now that I won't as I was then that I absolutely would. 

Only a couple people in my life know this about me and I'm so chill and one of the most empathetic people they've ever even met that they don't view me as a threat in any light, and again for that I am thankful. There was a point where my twin was afraid I was going to murder her but if I even made a threat about wanting to kill someone she'd probably just laugh in my face, that how much I've changed.

Anyway I'll simply request no one bash me over the head for this. Not to many people, if any, can help how they feel, all we can control is what we do and what we allow our minds to ruminate over, I stopped letting my mind focus on the desire for it and it went away, that seems to be all it took."

"Basically, everything except the spinning dirt. A tornado is formed in a complex process involving a supercell (rotating) storm, and is birthed from a mesocyclone. They are very violent and can have winds up to or surpassing 300mph. They form within the parent storm aloft and connect with the ground. 

A dust devil is merely a small, rotating warm updraft (upward moving air) produced by a hot parcel of air rising through a cooler parcel of air. They occur on sunny or fair weather days, and do not attach to clouds at all. They can be somewhat strong in rare cases, although property damage is rarely reported. 

Now there's a semi-hybrid of these two basically unrelated weather phenomenon- the landspout tornado. A landspout is a weak, dust-devil-esque tornado that forms from the ground up as opposed to the sky down. The whirling updraft connects with the cloud base, in which there is no mesocyclone present. Usually landspouts are not birthed from storm clouds, rather, they tend to form in the updraft of a building cumulus tower before it reaches the cumulonimbus (storm) phase. 

That's one of the reasons I have a very difficult time classifying these whirls as landspouts- there is no clear or evident connection to the cloud base and this storm was already mature by the time these whirls appeared. They were also on the leading edge of the storm, in high winds, which seems to point more towards gustnado (basically a glorified, stronger than usual dust devil produced on the gust front of a strong thunderstorm). 

I hope that helps answer your question! I love talking weather so if you have any more please let me know. I will never skip a chance to geek out, haha. "

Honestly I feel like teams are largely banning the heimer b/c they value him being below average versus above average as a higher value ban than whatever they can get by taking out another champ from the other players.  If with a single ban you can knock a player from good  to not very good there is very  little reason not to do that ban.  RNG made many other mistakes in pick/ban that i think cost  them the series.  I  really don't think hjarnan on heimer is unbeatable by any means but teams would rather play a weak adc than a strong heimer.

"&gt; Jhoira of the Ghitu won't be top-tier any way you slice it, but you can set yourself up to take games from the best 

I unfortunately have to agree with this, however we're here to try and make it as good as possible.

&gt; Cut one of your creatures, probably Utvara Hellkite, for Baral, Chief of Compliance. He's better than a mana dork in this deck. Clockspinning can probably come out for Jhoira's Timebug if you're keen on sticking to the Suspend theme; the former is very do-nothing and buyback is very expensive .

I agree with the cut of Utvara, but I don't think clockspinning is bad at all; You don't have to use the buyback, which makes it a worse fury charm for the most part, but we can choose to use buyback in the end-step right before our turn, or just catch people off guard by bringing in a suspended card a turn early. Whereas timebug is very telegraphed meaning people will be ready with counterspells or other interaction.

&gt; Shivan Sand-Mage seems pretty bad. Timebender and Rift Elemental aren't where really where we want to be, though the latter is okay at pressuring life totals in the absence of anything else. 

I agree with Sand-Mage, Timebender, and Rift Elemental being weak, as unless you're facing an Ad-naus deck its entirely irrelevant, and even more so since you will likely do it in endsteps to surprise people, which means the attack doesn't even last until you can attack.

&gt; Fury Charm is alright just because it has a ""destroy artifact"" alternate mode; to that end, I'd rather be casting By Force for the mana cost of Timecrafting. 

I'm okay with Fury Charm because its more flexible than the other options and its the most efficient way of removing counters.

&gt; Slot Blood Moon and Magus of the Moon. They'll improve your performance against powered decks. 

Fully agree.

&gt; Slot As Foretold and Delay. Not only are these fantastic in the deck, but if you choose to stick with the suspend-helper subtheme, you can interact with the time counters on them. 

Not sure about As Foretold, but Delay should definitely be in the deck. Although I have yet to test As Foretold.

&gt; Find space for Dramatic Reversal and Isochron Scepter. A Merchant Scroll would help you find the former, while you could slot Inventors' Fair if you consistently board enough artifacts to activate the tutor effect. With infinite Reversal activations, you can produce infinite mana and draw your library with Sensei's Divining Top or any Stroke of Genius analogue 

I don't think this is the kind of deck for IsoRev, simply because the cards are very bad alone (Dramatic Reversal because we're not a storm deck and Isochron having very few targets) and the tutors for the combo pieces aren't actually very good in the deck (Merchant scroll has very few targets and most of them are counterspells which means your opponents will be able to play around them easier). Lastly Stroke of Genius is not useful without infinite mana since it is bad when suspended, so I think this package doesn't add enough to the deck's consistency and strength to warrant inclusion.

&gt; I'd put a Tidespout Tyrant in the deck as an alternate win condition that can also be suspended out as a big value creature or win us the game with Omniscience, Ugin, and any creature. Drawing your library wins the game with Nexus of Fate in the absence of disruption; Isochron + Mystical Tutor for Nexus of Fate is also a win, though it's a very mana-expensive one. 

Once again I have to mention the fact that we're not really a storm deck so I don't think Tidespout will be quite good enough, but I do think Enter the Infinite plus some ""you have no maximum handsize effects"" will allow you to shuffle nexus in every turn and have infinite turns and EtI works really well with Omniscience and being suspended.

&gt; There's a lot of jank in here: Crawlspace, Arcanis the Omnipotent, Leyline of Anticipation, Darksteel Plate, Hammer of Nazahn, Hedron Archive, Swiftfoot Boots, Thran Dynamo, Victory Chimes, Wayfarer's Bauble, Arcane Denial, and Propaganda. 

Agreed here, although Arcanis is probably the only one that could possibly still find a slot in the deck, since it comes in with haste when suspended meaning it gets to draw 3 as soon as it lands. On second thought Victory Chimes might be okay due to being a way to suspend a card on each other player's turns, or mana sink the time removal effects, but seems better suited for casual tables.

&gt; Mystic Remora is indispensable here. Ponder, Preordain, Compulsive Research, and Manifold Insights are functional at Sorcery speed; Brainstorm and Fact or Fiction help us set up at Instant. The best counterspells you're not running are Flusterstorm, Mental Misstep, Negate, and Pact of Negation (for combo protection). If you run enough cantrips and fetches, or blow up all the lands, you can justify Treasure Cruise and Dig Through Time. Interaction pieces to consider include Submerge, Chain of Vapor, Pongify/Rapid Hybridization, and REB/Pyroblast. 

Agree with all of this. Mystic Remora: if you've got blue in your deck you should probably have this included, especially if you're running Rhystic Study. 

&gt; Finally, we could stand for some of our more do-nothing big dudes to generate card advantage; in the absence of anything else, they'll at least accelerate us toward a combo. I'd look at creatures to cut for Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur and Nezahal, Primal Tide. 

I like both of these, another option is \[\[Dragon Mage\]\] since we are very efficient at dumping our hand meaning we could possibly use the wheel better than our opponents, and we get to abuse the haste aspect of suspend again.

\[\[Niv-Mizzet Parun\]\] Is another option since its un-counterable and is a Rhystic Study type effect that we can also activate."

There's a lot I'd like to change about that, but that isn't really possible right now, so I make due with what I have. I have lost 11 lbs, I think I'm down to about 20% bf, and I'm making awesome progress in BJJ, the gym, and the mirror. 

I also start my fasting window right before BJJ (again, not ideal, but whatevs), so in my mind it feels like I'm kick-starting the fat burn.

tl:dr one to two hours of bjj and then an hour of gym stuff. I'm enjoying it"

"Hey, so first and foremost please consult your doctor for the best course of action. What I can say is that hospitals tend to be breeding grounds for infections like this, as the virus is able to replicate and spread very easily amongst a population of at risk individuals. I think the biggest factor in instances like this is that there are many immunocompromised people in close contact with each other, allowing easy spread and therefore survival of the virus. I think as long as you take proper precautions (washing hands, avoiding hospitals etc.) you likely will be ok. Again consult your doctor before you take my word as gospel.

"AH I'M SO JEALOUS. I want a .22 suppressor, but just cant justify it right now for anything. I jumped on a Ruger-SR a bit ago, but it was a pricing error :(

I would recommend a Mark IV just because the takedown is much, much easier for cleaning and modification. I love my MK III, but I don't love taking it down when I have to. The used varieties are really coming down in price hard, so I wouldn't hesitate if I saw a decent deal in your shoes. Threaded barrels are a little rarer though. 


I have a 10/22 Takedown, and in retrospect, I wish I had gotten a normal carbine but oh well. I put it in a Magpul X-22 Stock, VQ extractor, VQ bolt buffer, BX trigger (I recommend spending more for better personally), and a Nikon 3-9 scope. Hell of a fun gun, so moddable, so cheap to shoot. Definitely recommend one for any and all gun owners.

"No, it's not like that -- maybe I didn't find a clear way to put it.

The crit resistance and crit damage oppose one another, so to speak -- crit resistance is applied to your opponent's critical damage modifier.

So in your example, if a normal hit is 1000 and your opponent has the base critical modifier (1.5 or 50%), if you have zero crit resistance they will crit you for 1500 (before other sources of mitigation are applied). If you have 35% critical resistance, their critical damage modifier leaves them with 15% critical damage remaining after your resistance decreases their effective modifier. So they will deal 1150 damage (before other sources of mitigation are applied). "

I lifted heavy weights for years and did modified CrossFit workouts throughout pregnancy. I followed a lot of crossfitters who were pregnant and almost all of them seems to have pretty good birth stories.  I think the benefits will always outweigh any negatives (as long as there are no major health issues involved). 

I think there are also a lot of other factors including genetics when it comes to how long labor lasts. If anything I believe hat exercise will better prepare you for whatever happens."

"My fianc√© was very supportive when I felt uncomfortable using hormonal birth control, and then he was supportive when I was ready to get an iud. He did research because he was totally clueless and even wanted to ask his Dr. mom about it (then respected when I told him as much as I love his mom I don‚Äôt feel comfortable including her in on that conversation).

While I do believe that in a long term committed relationship birth control is a 2 person conversion, ultimately you are the one who has to deal with the benefits and consequences of the different types of birth control. If he feels really uncomfortable he can choose to wear condoms while you use the pill. Your comfort is not a trade for his relief. You can consider taking him to your appointment, and having the Dr. explain to him that the pill is a very safe option when used correctly, and that not all women react well to different types of birth control. 

Obviously that is only if you feel 100% comfortable with him there. I realized how clueless men are when it comes to birth control, and hearing it from a professional (like you do) may ease his mind. 

I believe in a healthy relationship, he should trust you. However anxiety is tough and that might just be a good way to take control of the situation and give him more information. 

It‚Äôs your body and your relationship op. Good luck! I wish you the best. "

"Really, every single syndicalist nation is portrayed incredibly positively, without showing the massive societal and economic disruptions that implementing a fully syndicalist system over about 15 years would cause. Like, it'd be cool to portray Syndie France as a bureaucratic hellhole as various unions and anarchist groups vie for power, or have the UoB be ""syndie in name only"" and be an isolationist radical social democracy, with left-wing figures pushing for more reform. That way, totalism would actually be an attractive (for the player) alternative as it would cut through the chaff of bureacuracy. Or, you could go the hard way and try to actually build a syndicalist utopia.

From a dramatic/storytelling standpoint, this would be amazing: a battered but still idealistic CSA that tries to make a socialist utopia comes hard against the endemic racism, sexism, xenophobia, and mistrust of their fellow man of 1930s American society. It should be a challenge to actually implement ""true syndicalism"" and not fall to  either the nightmare of totalism or the compromise of radical social democracy."

"Epic isn't *really* a flat organization. There are definitely opportunities for management positions. 

If you're interested in being a PM, why not just apply for a PM job? PMs don't really have any concrete education/prior experience requirements. If you think PM is more your fit, go for it. It's also worth pointing out that they often interview you for multiple positions at once. For example, I was interviewed for both tech comm and QA. Dev is a bit trickier, as you need some coding background, whereas TS generally is more vague with its technical requirements.

Transferring roles is definitely possible, though. However, you have to have been in your role for about 6-12 months, and you need to be a high performer. And even then, it's kind of a slow process as you get trained, transition your workload to someone else, etc. If you don't think you'll be happy being a TS for 1-2 years before transferring to a different role, I wouldn't take the job."

The reason why evidence is crucial is by the fact that if you were born on the other side of the world, you would be believing in entirely different god(s).

If you bring in a theory without any actual evidence, then I don't need evidence to dismiss it as you have not actually given any evidence to begin with, therefore there is no logical reason to believe you. I might add that it is foolish to believe something so fundamentally  important to society with no actual evidence to begin with.

"##TLDR: 

Former Superintendent Pleads Guilty to Pooping Under School Bleachers:

- Former Kenilworth Superintendent¬†Thomas Tramaglini¬†pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of defecating in public, a non-criminal municipal offense, according to NJ Advance Media.

- 

An attorney for police declined to comment, and said they don‚Äôt comment on ‚Äúthreatened litigation.‚Äù

- So much went on today (in court) that flies in the face of everything, unfortunately, he‚Äôs been through.

- He deserves a story that tells the accurate picture.‚Äù

He said his client suffered from ‚Äúrunners diarrhea,‚Äù a condition caused by blow flow during exercise.

- Intestinal problems or ‚Äúrunner‚Äôs trots‚Äù have been observed in long-distance runners.

"&gt;If they are soapboxing - like the post in question was - we will pull them but we don‚Äôt want to close the door to folks who do feel that way and are open to hearing the other side.

Don't get me wrong; I appreciate how quickly the post was taken down. I think it was an hour or less.

However, I still kind of feel like ""We'll leave it unless they're soapboxing"" could be problematic. The post in question awarded deltas for people changing views *after* it was already removed - and, again, the ""changed view"" was from ""genocide via nuclear bomb"" to ""genocide via land invasion.""

The post /u/cacheflow linked, which was *not* removed, seems to suggest that as long as deltas are awarded, the post can't be soap-boxing. But the deltas awarded in that thread indicate that the OP has not actually changed anything about their position - i.e. they are still a fan of mass murder.

So my question is: if the post I'm talking about had had deltas awarded *before* removal, would it have been removed? The impression I get from from that other post, and posts I've seen before, suggests it wouldn't be, and that seems problematic to me.

I could be wrong, though!

"Yeah, the only reason I would need a PE in software was if I was working on medical devices that actually go inside people, like pacemakers and such.

I don't think he actually cares about that though. Sometimes I get the feeling he just likes telling me I'm wrong about nitpicky things like that, and feeling like he's better than me.

To be fair, in my state, technically, if I were to imply that I was a PE, I could be sued if someone got the wrong idea. In his business, calling yourself an engineer is enough to imply that. But tons of people call themselves software engineers even though they don't meet the PE requirements, so I don't think calling yourself a software engineer is enough to imply that you're a PE. Obviously, I'm not a lawyer, but I'm not worried.

He might just be acting petty. He also bitches when people make up kinds of engineering to make their job sound important, like the little old lady from my grandma's church who called herself a housekeeping engineer to try to promote her housekeeping service."

They were also unphased by the idea that many poorer suburbs in Sydney are still far more expensive than Belco/Tuggers/Gunners and are highly competitive because there's a lot more diversity/competition (and many people have come from nothing elsewhere in the world so try extremely hard to get ahead - I dunno if that happens so much at Bundah college where the best you'll get is a doctor's son/daughter or some diplomat's kids who are okay at languages because they already speak a few).

The account also has  7 10% Moogles, 1 50% Moogle, 1 100% STMR moogle, 6 5% Moogles, and 10 1% Moogles. It also has about 7-10 of each 4 star stat burst pot, and 7 5 star burst pots.

The account isnt past the 1st chapter yet so there is a lot to be had with lapis, and there are several tickets available, and 8 UoC ticks. Overall the account would be great for a beginner or a veteran looking for a newer start with FFBE to start at a lower rank.

"Well if we derive from first principles we know that act 2 can plant a manga sound effect on an object. The object then gains the physical properties necessary to be able to do the thing represented by the sound effect, on contact - so Koichi could have broken that cliff himself if he had written some kind of ""crack"" sound where Yukako was about to land (he was probably out of range though).

I think it's reasonable to assume that Koichi can only place sound effects he already knows about, so Echoes is about as versatile as Koichi's manga collection is varied!

Couple of extra points, it looks like Echoes 2 can only use one sound effect at a time because the gem in its tail becomes the sound effect, so there's a limitation there. In the Yukako fight it additionally can blow a gust of wind; I assume all acts come with an inaugural gust of wind as a little symbol of the release of the personality he usually keeps away from the public"

"Hence why it would likely make sense to include a phase-in period, and probably a long one in the 10-20 year range. Prices would start dropping immediately but there would be a curve rather than a sharp, abrupt, and enormous discontinuity.

And, no, it's not too late to change the rules. When you build a house on a sand bar in a hurricane-prone area you're not guaranteed that the existing hurricane insurance regime will exist forever. You're assuming the risk that it may change in the future in reasonably foreseeable ways.

Similarly it's not ""too late to retroactively change the rules"" on crop price subsidies for farmers. We might want to phase out subsidies over time out of a desire to minimize disruption, but anyone who bought a farm on the assumption that those subsidies would exist always and forever without a potential for their reduction or even elimination is, in a limited sense, a fool."

"Hi, I'm relatively new to investing and don't know many terms you guys use but I will be 18 in a few weeks so I want to start investing. So far I have two stocks in mind.

I have wanted to invest in AMD for the past year or two but again I am not 18 so I couldn't benefit from the price rises since then. 

I haven't done as much research on the second one, but I want to invest in SSCO. I already have a few ounces of silver and about 20 lbs of high grade copper, and electronic components with relatively high amounts of gold saved for when the price goes up. My thinking is this, I could invest in Tesla or First Solar like my uncle suggest, but there's not much stopping someone with  better ideas to out-compete them in the same market. But companies making wind farms and electric cars will always need copper for their motors/generators no matter who's the big player. And silver will probably always be used and solar panels and electronics because it is the best conductor in the world, so instead of purely keeping these materials at home in the hopes of selling it in the future,I'm sure it'll be more monetarily efficient to invest in the companies getting them out of the ground. 

I want to find more companies that I can invest in and I would like you guys's input "

"I was fortunate to have been raised outside religion.

I claimed to be an atheist through childhood (though what do children know?). 

Despite my lack of church and even acknowledgement of God, I always felt sensitive to something greater than myself. I've had several dreams and predictions come true throughout my life, and I have always been able to feel other peoples' emotions/energies - almost to the point of being able to read some minds (I have, in fact, had moments of telepathy). It's like I'm able to tap into a sort of collective consciousness.

Several strange signs led me to pick a christian university 4 hours away from home, even though I was atheist. I felt called to go there - I don't know how else to describe it.

Once at university, I took a bunch of philosophy/religion classes and also began to dabble with entheogens.

I got to know and experience faith and belief from so many different walks of life at school. Intelligent souls grappling with life's greatest questions while still maintaining faith. They inspired me. 

However, my experience with entheogens solidified my relationship with God. I have learned that coincidences are just moments you realize you're in the right place at the right time  - you're on God's ""path"" if you will.

I now fully believe in God. And I also believe in a world where free will and fate co-exist. 

I believe God is subjective and will speak to you however he can. He has no specific religion, doctrine, or form. All that matters is following the calling to do good and be good, however we can. We all feel this calling, even if we try to fight it or pretend it isn't there.

God has laid out a path for each of us, but because man wanted to be free, we must choose the path through faith, intuitung signs along the way.

And, because free will exists and we aren't all following God's path to a T - there is sin. And because there is sin, there is suffering. This is unavoidable for even the holiest of men. The whole world has been sickened by lifetimes of sin.

Things like childhood cancer are a product of sin. I'm still working through divine providence (ie why heal one cancer kid and kill another), but I'm starting to believe in the power of prayer/meditation.


I could go on and on and on. PM me if you vibe with my crazy view of this world (or not, I'm always up to hear a different opinion). I may sound batshit, but I promise - I'm grounded and well educated.

My favorite thinkers are Kierkegaard, Kant, and Terrence McKenna. 

I also believe in things like Karma and reincarnation, if you're into more of an eastern thing.

I'm about to buy my first gun in a couple of weeks and in order to make a good choice, last week, I took a full day off so I could try multiple guns, calibers, bolt action VS semi, etc. I felt in love with the .308 cartridge and now I'm thinking about putting my hands on a Norinco M305. Is it a decent choice? Anything I should be looking for? I heard a lot of good stuff about them, but also a lot of bad stuff... Any opinions or advices are highly appreciated!!

Thanks."

I attempted to model future growth for Vocus (no guarantees on its accuracy), it does look good for the next few years if they achieve targeted growth.

They have been through a difficult period, but there are good signs with iPrimus, Dodo relaunch, backend changes, ASC completion, refinance, new CEO.

From my point of view im happy vocus isnt heavily exposed to mobile because i expect drama, but others disagree and see mobile as an important growth sector (Vocus has plenty of room for growth without mobile)

I dont expect any big changes to NBN margins, but if there are TPG will benefit the most (if the merger DOESNT go ahead) because they have a larger share of their own revenue from fixed line.

I think the TPM VHA merger will cause problems for the merged entity for quite a few years, especially due to a culture clash,  Teoh wont be CEO, he is famous for being a cheap, but i dont know that Vodafone will want to continue to see it run that way.

I am watching Telstra closely, i expect a good long term buying opportunity in the next couple of years, if i could see the possibility of growth and it was at its low, i would be tempted. But i dont see any significant growth opportunities with current management.

Vocus spreadsheet, **keep in mind Vocus has gone up about 50% from its lows already**, so maybe not much room for short term gains, hard to say.

"Metal (black/death/industrial) may be more complex, in some instances, instrumentally, but there's little if any melody. It's only musically a smidgen above ""Rap"". Just like you can't compare Cannibal Corpse's ""growling"" with Su's singing. One is musical, one MIGHT only qualify as such since it is placed in the framework of a song. (But THEN you'd have to qualify CC's stuff as a song or a tune) A melody is something you can whistle. It's something that requires musical skill to compose. There's not a lot of musical skill involved in the WRITING of ""songs"" like CC produces. It's a riff plus growling indecipherable lyrics. The musical skill is only involved in playing the instruments.

It is harder, and much rarer, to WRITE good songs with strong melodies than to tend toward hard core metal. You may have to be an instrumental virtuoso to be a top metal musician, but you don't have to be a real songwriter."

First of all, ***never ever ever never*** bring this up to her- don't ever accuse a woman of being hormonal, it's nearly impossible for me to take that the right way and it always comes out as a jab- but- anecdotal:

I was best friends with a girl for six years. We were already adults and pretty settled in who we are as human beings. We had a great relationship. She was an awesome friend, always there for me, we went really deep with each other and knew everything about each other. We were constantly going out to cultural events, out dancing, learning, and growing together. I never really thought about her not being in my life.  

When she got the implant it was about a month before she started getting really frustrated with me. I felt like I couldn't say anything right. I felt like an idiot around her sometimes. She was short with me, curt- and there just wasn't any other catalyst I could possibly imagine. It really hurt but I accepted it and I haven't spoken with her since. It's been four years. 

That being said, if she felt this way in the beginning I can understand her feelings now. What are your love languages? (please look this up if you're unaware it's a quick read to get the jist) If her love langauge is words/communication that could mean pretty deep convos, dreaming together, really asking her about herself in a loving way type of thing. She could be a gifts type of person, where she really feels love when you get her something or do something really romantic with her (that doesn't necessarily require money) So in the end it could be that she's not feeling love from you in the way she understands. Also she could just be bored. The best thing you can do is give her space/time so she can step back and see what she had with you. Don't end it on a sour note, be the loving understanding guy you are, and that will create an environment where she feels truly accepted by you. If you want her back it will make it easier for that to happen if it's meant to be. You seem really healthy about the whole thing in general although her living far away I do understand her texting you at first to talk about it. "

"I agree, I too used to really disliked Cho in the past and now have more sympathy for her. That being said, I don't think Harry was particularly bad to her. He was a bit clueless at times but its sort of expected for a 14/15 year old having their first foray into romance. I think Cho was a bit unfair to Harry during their ""time together"" almost trying to use him as a way to get over Cedric. Harry was pretty clueless during their disastrous date in 5th year (especially in relation to him just blatantly saying he had to go meet Hermione after) but she wasn't very fair to him in that situation either. She even tried to defend her friend to Harry after she sold the whole DA out to Umbridge. I don't think he was wrong to end things there though, like her said, her actions were understandable under the circumstances."

"One week in to early voting and they still have yet to provide the 'routine' transport to voting stations.  Also:

TLDR: some white person got upset so many black people were voting, called it in to the County Voting Commission who called the non-residential senior center who kicked the black people off the bus.  Systemic voter suppression, clear as day.  The reality is, those seniors should have never gotten off the bus as the center and Commission has no legal authority to do so.

Why did I decide to try archery? My employer's health benefits started including a variety of incentives to promote more active lifestyles around the time I finished binging a season of Arrow, I guess.

The first class bored the hell out of me. Too much safety and too little science. How could I improve our latest game's bow algorithm without more physics?

By the end of the second class, was disappointed in myself. I missed the target almost every time. When I did hit the target, it just grazed the edge. But the instructor told us all we were doing fine for our first time and that we'd all be amazed at our progress after a month or two of practice.

I DID get better over the next several weeks! I'd never be an Olympic athelete or even an expert, but I found archery a great way to blow off steam once a deadline had been met. Once, while practicing on my own time, the solution to a problem I had been struggling with in a subroutine suddenly came to me. I decided to stick with it.

Then came our archery class graduation tournament. I don't know if someone had a seizure or showed up drunk, but I ended up getting shot. The EMTs raced me to an ambulance. I don't remember anything except waking up once and seeing the head of development signing paperwork. I assumed I was high on meds at the hospital and, as I dozed off, wrote it off as an hallucination.

I awoke in a rough wagon bouncing over rougher terrain. My hands were numb from tight bindings. The wagon stopped and, while the others were led to an executioner's block, I was led to a small, one room building where the head of development was waiting.

Title: **If I informally donate breastmilk to another mother's baby and the baby were to get sick, am I legally responsible?**

Original Post: 

&gt; Title says it all but here are the details:
&gt; 
&gt; I am a breastfeeding mother and I have a lot of extra milk in my freezer. Human Milk 4 Human Babies is a global network of informal milk donation. Families who need milk for their babies can connect with mothers who have milk to share. There is no exchange of money or anything like that, it's just donation of breastmilk from one family to another.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently connected with a mother whose baby is, in her words, ""medically fragile"" and does not tolerate infant formula. She doesn't make enough milk in her own for her baby and relies on donor milk. I don't know if many of you know much about breastmilk donation, but there's not just some giant milk bank that you can get a prescription and get the milk you need. She is running low on milk and is worried, and I offered some of mine.
&gt; 
&gt; Now my husband is very worried that I could be putting our family in danger of legal repercussions if something were to happen to this other woman's baby after drinking my milk. *I* know my milk is safe (i.e. not poisoned, I'm not on any drugs or medications, it has been stored according to safety guidelines for storing breastmilk). But the process to become a donor to donate to milk banks is a huge hassle and many informal donors don't go through with it, so I have no ""paperwork"" to prove anything about my milk.
&gt; 
&gt; If the other baby were to get sick, could I be held legal responsible?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not here for lectures on informal milk donation, just legal advice. I know it's not FDA-approved, etc. I have provided milk to mothers I know personally before, but this is the first time I've offered milk to someone I don't know well.

En cuanto al tema del ""ind√≠gena bueno"", a eso usualmente se le llama ""Noble savage"" en academia;

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage

Y por la mayor parte es un mito preservado por culturas occidentales que fetichizan la ""pureza"" del primivismo, ocurre harto en c√≠rculos de ""hippies"" que b√°sicamente veneran a las culturas ind√≠genas americanas, no porque sean realmente ""nobles"", sino que porque les ""gusta"" ser contrarios a la cultura occidental.


Hay millones de cosas donde las culturas ind√≠genas sol√≠an estar en ""m√°s balance"" con el planeta que ""nosotros"", pero ""mas balance"" no significa que ellos estuviesen un ""balance"" real, ellos se encontraban forzados a convivir en aquellos sistemas naturales, no porque quisieran, sino que porque simplemente no ten√≠an otra opci√≥n.

&gt; Ahora la vemos como algo inferior , abusamos de ella a nuestro antojo 

Nah, tal vez en el 1950, o 1800's esto habr√° sido verdad, pero hoy en d√≠a la sociedad occidental se mueve a grandes pasos hacia algo parecido a la estabilidad ambiental, especialmente gracias al desarrollo tecnol√≥gico en las industrias de  agroganadera y energ√≠a.

&gt;Hahah no es necesario que sea como indigena pero si desde un punto de vista mas despierto.

Si es que te gustar√≠a vivir ""en balance"" con la tierra, siendo neutral en carbono, tendr√≠as que vivir como alguien promedio en paraguay o south sudan, e idealmente siendo vegano tambn.

Hace un par de a√±os hab√≠a hecho los c√°lculos para poder saber que se necesitaba para poder ser 100% carbon neutral, y el resultado que obtuve fue que ten√≠as que mantener un total de ~1.1 CO2 tons. Para que te hagas una idea, Chile tiene un [tonCO2 per capita de 4.69](https://www.google.com/search?q=chile+co2+emissions+per+capita&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-ab), [India de 1.7](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;ei=zQXRW8qtCoSpwAT2rrrwDg&amp;q=india+co2+emissions+per+capita&amp;oq=india+co2+emissions+per+capita&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i7i30l7j0i8i7i30l3.62081.62561..62702...0.0..0.127.476.0j4......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71.6sqx1jgqBHw), y [Australia 15.3](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;ei=DQbRW-ueLYiQwgTU-K_4Cw&amp;q=australia+co2+emissions+per+capita&amp;oq=australia+co2+emissions+per+capita&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i7i30j0j0i30.24710.28668..28819...5.0..0.143.1856.2j14......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i8i7i30j0i67j0i13.Y2CS7J946xk)


&gt;, la respetaban 

Nonono, y es por eso que la civilizaci√≥n Maya colaps√≥, lo mismo con los Olmecas.

La √∫nica raz√≥n por la cual ""pareciera"" que ellos viv√≠an en ""balance"" con la naturaleza es por la gigantesca ola de muerte que ocurri√≥ por la viruela y otras enfermedades:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Acuna-Soto_EID-v8n4p360_Fig1.png

La cual forz√≥ a los sobrevivientes a volver a un estado nom√°dico de vida, abandonando sus ciudades y civilizaciones, debido a que las ciudades donde ellos hab√≠an vivido previamente se convirtieron en centros de contagio y muerte.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippian_culture

&gt;After the destruction and flight of the de Soto expedition, the Mississippian peoples continued their way of life with little direct European influence. Indirectly, however, European introductions dramatically changed native societies in the Eastern United States. Because the natives lacked immunity to new infectious diseases, such as measles and smallpox, epidemics caused so many fatalities that they undermined the social order of many chiefdoms. Some groups adopted European horses and changed to nomadism.[19] Political structures collapsed in many places. 

Los sobrevivientes de las oleadas de enfermedad y muerte se vieron en una situaci√≥n donde ten√≠an un gigantesco surplus de recursos, pero no ten√≠an la forma de poder concentrarse en ciudades debido al contagio y contaminaci√≥n cruzada, entonces desde nuestra perspectiva pareciera que ellos ""viven en harmon√≠a"", pero esa ""harmon√≠a"" es falsa, ya que si dependiese de ellos, ellos se volver√≠an a agrupar en ciudades de la misma forma que exist√≠an antes de la llegada de europeos.


No estoy seguro si describ√≠ la situaci√≥n historica bien, hay mucha historia y contextos que tuve que ignorar, asique si tienes dudas, avisame"

"I think the key difference are as follows:  
Ambient occlusion is present  
Larger shadow resolution and distance  
Greater grass distance and density   
Doodads pop-in at a greater distance  
Updated water texture  
Cloud Level of Detail is higher.  

I think the farclip (fog distance) is the same because it's limited by whichever map you're on, for instance, during Wrath of the Lich King you could raise farclip to above 2000, but in Elywnn Forest you wouldn't be able to see any further than 500.

Personally, I'm not too sure about the water, as it is a newer asset and it doesn't follow their apparent design philosophy of keeping original models/textures, but using better graphics effects, but that's minor.

"You are right. If his 8 year old son wants to dress up like a black athlete, political, or movie star - is that disrespectful?  Clearly the intent behind that type of costume - by a child or an adult - is just as racist as ‚Äúblack face‚Äù performers in the past. 

What about masks? Is a white personal wearing an Obama mask racist? 

What about hair? Is an ‚ÄúAfro‚Äù wig on a white person racist?

This ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù style of labeling everything you disagree with as racism  - and equating it to something as horribly racist as lunching - is not solving any problems.

Destiny right now is dangerously close to tipping the scales. If someone doesn¬¥t know about Wish Ender, he has to wait weeks before he can try again, and that also sets back his Corrupted Egg popping, where the ones in Ascendant Challenges are on a 6 week rotation. And it sets up a schedule for that person where he needs to log on every week without missing certain activities or he will be set back even further.

In games like Skyrim, I can start playing a year after the game is released and I will still find all that stuff people searched first week for. In Destiny, maybe months from now that stuff will be obsolete. In a year, for sure. 

Mystery is great, but it sucks when you find something cool, go online and then your smile freezes when you read that you missed half of that questline and need to wait weeks before it comes back again. "

A few things. One is that, when killed, they bleed at least as much psychic energy as blood(Ferrus, Alpharius). Two they're all exceptionally bright from an astropath's perspective, even the ones that aren't active psykers(Dorn). Three, they took the form of the people that discovered them(Fulgrim was seen as this happened. He was absolutely nothing resembling a human before then.)

Then there's the primarchs physical abilities. The clones of primarchs don't have the same strengths as the originals regardless of how perfect the body is, though they are stronger than astartes. Only exception is Fulgrim's clone, who had something happen that gave it a warp essence as well. Cloned primarchs also didn't result in a lightshow when they died."

"Your computer's operating system stores files by 

1. Writing the data to disk

2. Keeping a list of *where* on disk to find all the files it knows about

When you ""delete"" a file, it doesn't immediately overwrite the data on disk, it just removes the entry from the list that says ""Here's where to find that file"". So it's *temporarily* possible to recover a deleted file by scanning the disk itself and looking for valid file data.

"Yeah, I think a punch in the face would suffice, but I guess if someone did get seriously beat up for things like this occasionally, maybe everyone would stop and think before they vandalized things for no reason. I think the original point in this thread is that there just isn't much in the way of consequences for such egregious behaviour. Maybe if it was ""You damaged my property, I will now damage your body,"" it would give pause. And if it ends up with a vandal walking with a limp from then on, they will remember to keep their destructive tendencies to their own possessions.

"I think there's a disconnect between furries and non-furries when it comes to how much weight we assign the animal traits. You might look at furry art and see animals with human characteristics, but most of us view them more as people with animal characteristics. There's a huge difference between those two ideas, especially when it comes to sexual attraction. 

Outside of the societal stereotypes like 'hung like a horse' or 'frisky like a fox', there's usually not much sexualization of the animal traits in a furry character. The conventionally attractive human traits are where the really sexuality comes from, and the human personality is what makes people able to form an emotional attachment to the character that includes sexual attraction. 

Just take a look at Star Fox's [Krystal](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfox/images/1/1b/Krystal.jpg), who's wildly popular among furries. Aside from the blue fur and stylized cartoon fox head, she's essentially a conventionally attractive, scantily clad woman who knows martial arts. It's Laura Croft re-skinned as a blue alien fox."

"If absolute neoliberal proponents had their way, working people in this country would be seriously fucked. But I understand your point and I think there's plenty of examples historically and currently which support that. 

Plenty of examples of people who ~~feel~~ are disenfranchised by the economic and political system who end up getting caught up in the momentum that promises something better but is infact something much worse.

But what always upsets me is the lack of willingness people have to accept that we've got a lot of strife and work to do, as an entire society before we reach anything that resembles a truly just society. 

Most people don't appreciate the effort and suffering of the nameless and countless number of people went through just to give us, their descendants, the right to vote. The trauma and horror people endured to protect ourselves during world wars, and the tireless effort and sacrifice people made even after that to secure basic services. 

We live in an increasingly consumeristic, apathetic and ""easy option"" society. People don't want to acknowledge they need to sacrifice their time and labour to improve conditions. Theyll happily sit by while our leaders brush up to dictators and tyrants who suppress their own people because they keep things ""stable"" in that part of the world, theyll happily sit by while we subject entire populations to bombing campaigns or block waves of refugees escaping unspeakable horror and injustice because ""theres a terrorist among them somewhere"", theyll happily rant against Brexit because it's too scary risking change.

The reality is that if we truly want things to change for the better, it means personal sacrifice to get involved in utilising democratic rights and with the state of things, until people feel the heat, they wont think theyre gonna burn.

EDIT: And also, I mean there's still plenty of sacrifice people need to be willing to make, EVEN if Corbyn is elected, if supporters think they can sit back once he's elected and all will be fine, then theyre seriously, seriously mistaken. He's a parliamentarian, he will compromise principles, he will not deliver on certain expectations and he will buckle under the pressure of private interests."

"Lets start off by stating that the resting potential of a nerve cell is -70mV. How did it get to this point?  
  
The cell pumps out 3 potassium ions (K+) for every 2 sodium ions (Na+) brought in. Because more positive ions are sent out than are brought in, there is a net negative charge within the cell. (There's also something called potassium leak channels which also contribute to the negative charge, but I'll skip over it for the sake of simplicity.) The pump that carries this out is called the sodium-potassium ATPase. This pump is powered by the breakdown of ATP to ADP + Pi. ATP is a high-energy molecule because it consists of 3 negative charged phosphate groups bonded close together. Keep in mind that negative charges will repel other negative charges, so the bonds that hold the phosphate groups together in ATP must be high-energy. Energy cannot come from or go nowhere, so when one of the bonds is broken in the conversion of ATP to ADP, that energy is used to power the sodium-potassium pump, along many other processes in the cell.  
  
The food you eat is broken down into fatty acids and glucose. These items can be metabolized in different chemical reactions to send the energy from their bonds to ADP + Pi to reform ATP."

Russia and China have made advances in copying stealth from stolen information and reverse-engineered technology, but they are still lagging behind.
Further, their advances aren't making it easier to detect stealth, it is just making it possible to copy it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I believe my basic point stands (which is not necessarily that the F-35 is worse than old aircraft (and remember the F-111 is 60s tech!), but rather that it is not sufficiently superior to warrant the cost).

F-35 is similar in price to other 4.5 gen aircraft that Australia could buy, like the Super Hornet and F-16V, so the additional costs are minimal or negligible when considering the greater airframe lifespan of the F-35 versus those planes.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Even in the scenario above, Wedgetail is detecting a low/fast 60s bomber travelling at 480kt, at about 150km... that's a thin margin for the defender.

350+ km, not 150km. That's a quite large margin, and allows a single AWACS aircraft to cover a large amount of airspace.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The extremely long lead time for the F-35 means it's closer to obsolescence once in service.

There's no sign the F-35 is obsolete yet; factual analysis of the capabilities of the plane versus modern air defences indicates the plane can do it's job quite well, and there isn't any developments likely in the next few decades that will change that.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I'm curious also as to how likely it is to be detected when refuelling, which would have to occur for any serious Australian-scenario interdiction?

With the F-35's 1200 km combat radius on internal fuel, aerial refuelling can take place well outside hostile airspace.

Even if the tanker is detected at such long distances, enemy air defences still won't be able to make useful predictions of where the F-35s are going to fly.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The F-35 will cost each taxpayer about $4000 (cost over life divided by number of taxpayers), the submarines are shaping up to cost twice what the F-35 program is... and that's for two weapons. Given how obsessed we are about costs as applied to education, health and so on, it's interesting that none of Australians' reflexive public spending frugality applies to weapons.

Defense is sadly expensive, but it is necessary to defend our way of life from aggressors, as being defenceless will cost us far more if a war does break out.

There is a certain amount of implied/assumed awareness and expertise when you are competing in something at the highest level. It happens all the time in sports as well. Players do in fact do dumb things in high pressure situations (JR Smith). So yeah it is fair to critique someone's situational awareness when it is warranted and explain the rationale why.

"They didn't abandon the Articles of Confederation. They passed the U.S. Constitution under the authority derived from the Articles.

And you do realize that St. George Tucker wasn't a Supreme Court judge. He was a district court judge, from Virginia, and his strict constructionism view of the Constitution was very much a minority opinion for the time, and was not supported by the Supreme Court when his idea of how the Constitution worked came before them. Chief Justice John Marshall [""forcible stated""](https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2467&amp;context=law-faculty-publications) the court's rejection of the Tucker view of the Constitution in *Maryland v. McCulloch*, and in *Martin v. Hunter's Lessee*, which you've incorrectly interpreted above, Justice Joseph Story's opinion explicitly stated:

&gt; ""[T]he constitution of the United States...was ordained and established not by the *states* in their soveriegn capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the constitution declares, by the people of the United States.""

This was a direct rejection of St. George Tucker's interpretation of the Constitution--that it was a ""compact"" of states and not a contract among all the people of the United States. Story, writing for the unanimous majority, said that was a complete misinterpretation, and the Constitution is a contract of all the people. And the ruling in *Martin* stated that the federal government and the states were not equal sovereigns--the federal government had supreme authority.

Thereby, since states are not party to the Constitution, but only the people are, then no state government has a right to withdraw from the Constitution as the Southern states did. The terms of the Constitutional contract can only be changed by the people themselves, and the process to do that is explicitly stated there--the Amendment process. If a state wants to withdraw, they need to get permission from the people of the United States--*all* the people, and not just the people in their own state.

The argument you are trying to advance is exactly the argument made by Jefferson Davis and the Confederates, who knew it was a losing legal argument, because of the precedents laid out in these court cases you keep on citing. So instead of filing a lawsuit, they fired guns, because they knew they'd lose in court and stood a better chance militarily.

But you can keep on trying to claim to be a ""federalist"" by misinterpreting the same SCOTUS decisions the Confederates did, and that Madison, Jackson, and Washington had all made statements against, i.e. the union was perpetual. And no single state had any legal right to exit the U.S. Constitutional contract without first getting permission of *all* the people of *all* the states through the Constitutional Amendment process.

I got to meet people from HelloTalk with actual language exchange intentions. Guess that people that put they want to learn Spanish actually want to learn it.
"I actively started masking around 14 years old, however I have memories of inhibiting my behaviour, based on a fear of being laughed at or teased by the other kids, from as young as 6ish I think. So I probably started actively doing it around then, however it wasn't until around that 14ish years that I took it to another level.  
Then around 18-20 I ratched it up that masking to a new level again, integrating a great deal of reading and (somewhat understanding) of communication books and body-language etc.  
Around 25ish I went through another burst of focused learning, centered around psychology, physiology, neurology and biochemistry. It was at about this point that I learned to realise that I simply could not simulate and maintain awareness of all the various different, subtle cues to both interpret from others and send out as signals to them in a way that would maintain an emotional fluency in the communication. Too many subtle, non-congruent effects that just end up causing a breakdown of that emotional communication and that sense of 'connection' to others and for them to feel connected to me.  

Unfortunately, so much attention and practice of masking has created a very large range of conditioned responses to various stimuli that if I don't catch them, I'll just react that way. However they are based on what is essentially self-taught conditioning and aren't truly a highly varied and fluid emotional response to the stimuli that it should be, particularly in social situations.  

You could say the masking is 'subconscious', but not really, it's more a reflex.  

I've come to the understanding that Masking is inherently flawed when it comes to trying to form meaningful connection with others. It significantly interferes developing deeper interpersonal relations with others, however it can be very good for protecting against imminent emotional pain (which is why most of us start masking in the first place). This protection against pain is excellent, for the short term. However it is losing strategy in the long term.  

So now I am focusing on building up my emotional flexibility and depth, allowing more emotional impulses to guide my behaviours, trying to not inhibit them as best I can, within reason (some impulses *must* be inhibited, or potentially significant negative outcomes can occur, certain behaviours in the workplace for example).  

When I can engage my emotional state in a way that I properly *feel* emotional *affect* when interacting with people, and allow my emotional impulses to motivate my behaviours and movements, etc without inhibiting them, it tends to work out well, much more often than not. However, it seems it is extremely difficult to Learn from this in such a way that it becomes the 'go to' state, as I think it is supposed to be. The fear-based behaviours are extremely strong and seem to be extremely resistant to reducing and extinguishing them.  

That's no reason to stop trying tho. The rewards for emotionally engaging properly, are too great to not continue to try. Of course, my emotional engagement is still shaped by everything I've experienced and learned leading towards this, so my emotionally driven impulsive behaviours are far, far more socially/culturally 'appropriate' then they were when I was young which is likely what caused the whole social-fear leading to inhibition and masking situation..  

If only I had been diagnosed much earlier in life and received proper social skills training, perhaps I wouldn't be so socially anxious and anxious in general all the time.

"It's really not subjective. We had an intern last summer with zero communication skills.

Instead of simply walking up to one of us (his team) and asking a question, or even messaging us on slack/skype, he would pace around behind us until someone finally got uncomfortable enough to ask him if he needed help with something. While actively helping him with something, we would explain a concept or give him instructions on his next steps and instead of either acknowledging what we said or asking follow up questions, he would say nothing. We had to explain something and always ask ""do you understand?"" and then wait a good 15-20 seconds for him to realize it's his turn to respond. Half the time we had to then say ""are you sure?"" because he would kind of mumble the word yes not very confidently. It felt like we were talking down to him, but if you didn't talk to him that way he simply would not respond. 

Don't even get me started on the presentation he had to do in front of a couple hundred people.  It's not like he wasn't smart. The kid had a 3.9+ GPA with only a semester left of undergraduate. He just clearly doesn't any experience interacting with people.

Sure you can say he's an introvert, but this was far beyond any introvert I've dealt with. Honestly I think introvert/extrovert is irrelevant. It comes down to practice. Generally, extroverts get more practice because they initiate conversations. All that means is introverts need to recognize it's a weakness and have to practice more to be on a even playing field."

Essentially for days now people have been spamming the same picture Kanderous showed above, over and over, and the same buildzoid teardown of a Gigabyte board over and over, where buildzoid drew a line in the sand (around 35:00) in the vid defining a phase as the inclusion of a doubler  - so 'no doubler, no phase'.

And several people, including Steve from HU, basically said what Asus was doing was implying 8 phases when there were really only 4, because Asus no longer uses the traditional IR3599 doublers we've seen on so many previous boards.

Over at [overclock.net](https://overclock.net) there is a mega thread "" Z370 / Z390 VRM Discussion Thread"" where Asus's current more efficient method of doubling is explained.

Here's an explanation, cued up

[https://www.overclock.net/forum/6-intel-motherboards/1638955-z370-z390-vrm-discussion-thread-254.html#post27680702](https://www.overclock.net/forum/6-intel-motherboards/1638955-z370-z390-vrm-discussion-thread-254.html#post27680702)

Again cued up

[https://www.overclock.net/forum/6-intel-motherboards/1711414-z390-aurous-master-vrs-asus-rog-hero-2.html#post27683206](https://www.overclock.net/forum/6-intel-motherboards/1711414-z390-aurous-master-vrs-asus-rog-hero-2.html#post27683206)

Note from that link above "" *Tech Yes City* tested the Hero and had it was cooler than the z390  Taichi that uses doublers with 10x TI NexFETs, so the implementation  acts more like an 8 phase. ""

A lot of of this was propagated by Steve from HU's vid and his subsequent comments that the XI Hero is using 'fake' phases. Honestly I have no idea what his agenda was ... views? clickbait? driving people to his channel by creating controversy. The allegations most certainly were not based in fact.

I'd highly advise watching  [Asus JJ's vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOXH2YIMi2Y&amp;t=1863s) on how to OC your Asus board, as even if you're running stock as it  give a great overview of the BIOS

Tell their SO they want to talk about a specific issue ahead of time. Before the discussion they should both think about the issue and why it's a problem. Then come up with points to talk about. Facts about the problem (not generalizations, void words like never and always.) How these facts make them feel. What they want. And a few ideas on how to compromise in order to solve the issue.

When they have the discussion, it should be a safe space for them to share their thoughts and feelings. That means they can't insult each other and have to listen to the other person's point. If he doesn't want to do that, she should leave."

Seems like you must have had it pretty rough growing up. Sorry to hear that. In retrospect I was bloody lucky due to my environment and upbringing. My dad is almost certainly on the spectrum too, and agrees with me after learning more about autism. He saw I had similar problems that he had growing up and used his experience to help me understand others and adapt. Definitely helped a lot. He is great socially as an adult, but like me, can sometimes lapse into long detailed monologues. :p

&amp;#x200B;

I often wonder if I would have gained this level of social prodiciency had I been diagnosed as a kid. According to my early development questionnaire, I could have been diagnosed at 3 or 4. Had quite a developmental delay. I was naturally happy and compliant, though, so the paediatrician in 1990 or '91 ignored the fact I walked on the balls of my feet, would do repetitive stuff etc. Just said I would ""grow out of it""...

No joke, the US military gives soldiers going on leave briefings for certain areas of things likely to result in death or kidnapping and it is always the alt-right. If you have a base nearby in the United States, they track the same kind of stuff domestically and make it available to us prior to moving into areas. Shockingly, or not, right-wing groups are usually the ones they brief about or provide data about.

One such report for the DC area clearly stated if you show fascist tendencies there was a slim chance of violence being committed against you. The same report showed that if you consistently showed left leaning support at rallies and such there was about a 15% chance of you being targeted by violent protests and it named groups such as the ""Proud Boys"" as being the primary cause.

So that's why. Hell you can pull the crime statistics themselves from the FBI's website, they show a higher chance of violence from the right than the left, like a much higher chance.

Or you could look at the fellow who also posted to you, and check his wiki claims. "

My LGS was doing a free mini masters/pack wars day and no one was buying any packs so I was spending a bit just buying random packs but the whole day I was opening all the mythics and when I pulled a pack from the sealed INN box someone commented how I would probably get a LOTV and lo and behold it was a foil one.

In the Clemson example, if the football team got hammered, it would take away a ton of revenue that other programs rely on and it's essentially the athletics dept cash cow.  If you can't prove the school or AD knew about it, should they still get punished?  

Example look at NC State in this ordeal.  Our AD/compliance staff have proven that they investigated Gott/Staff/DSJ and were unable to find any proof that money traded hands.  Should that be sufficient enough to let the program off the hook?  

The NCAA is always a loose cannon so there's no telling which way they'll take the investigation or try to enforce things.  Feels like this case though will definitely give Universities to sue if they feel the NCAA over-steps or is too harsh in punishments.  "

One of my favorite shows on now and of all time, is Lucifer. That show suffered, and was eventually canceled by fox.... simply because the fanbase got fed up with the writing,  I.E. not allowing Lucifer to reveal that he actually IS THE DEVIL to the female lead/ his love interest. There were other problems with the show that hopefully Netflix fixes. But what I saw on twitter and reddit and other forms was that was the #1 complaint.

&gt;Batman and Superman have great villains to pick from,

Batman, definitely, Superman not even close as Batman's. Too many of Supes villains' conflict is reduced to punching contests. I get that superhero comics need a healthy dose of action, but if punching is the only source of tension, it makes the hero/villain interactions one-dimensional. Lex, Zod, and Bizarro evolved from this and that's why they're Superman's greatest villains."

2 week before an election is the perfect amount of time to not come to a conclusion about these bombs and enough time to try to influence votes.

Either way, the republicans are crushing the democrats right now, it would make no sense to motivate the opposing party to vote more. It would make sense for someone who hates Trump to do this to try and gather more democratic votes.

and when I said ""if you aren't liking DnD's combat"" that wasn't referring to *you*. Its a figure of speech. And OP was seeming to dislike the combat parts of DnD which is specifically why I brought that up.

&gt;So your comment doesn't make much sense. You seem to be thinking of roleplaying as what's left over when the combat is extracted, but neither the phrase negative space nor the phrase emergent storytelling support that.

"Point #2 (and/or #3) is still a little bit of a mystery IMO, we're assuming Razer is the only one doing standard Qi over 5W based solely off the compliance listings at the Qi consortium's site but AFAIK we don't even know what goes into that testing, or how phones are identifying different chargers etc.

Doesn't Apple's only go up to 7.5W as well? And it wasn't even enabled when the last iPhones launched, that seems like an equally bizarre choice since it's not much of a step up. I think there's a lot more to be learned and the companies aren't being very forthcoming, so it's only gonna happen if people/consumers figure it out on their own.

That's what I'm really disappointed in, this is the complete opposite of Google's goals with USB PD where they even made it part of the mandatory Android guidelines and helped move *that* standard forward (together with Apple and others) by creating good compliant hardware around it."

"You‚Äôre not sorry, 40 pounds is a lot of weight for some people, you‚Äôre right! CICO is how I lost that weight, and it required a lot of compromises during that time on how I want to live my life. It ain‚Äôt a magic wand of ‚ÄúI count calories, and now my life is better because I‚Äôm thinner,‚Äù though. It‚Äôs a lifelong learning process about adaptation and adjustment.

Many times, when people lose a lot of weight, they realize the weight wasn‚Äôt the root problem. When you can‚Äôt blame not being happy on your size (because you lost the weight), you‚Äôve gotta turn that focus on other issues, which is why I said weight is often a symptom of something else.

I lost the weight and still felt blah about myself, which is why I hopped into therapy and other resources to figure that part out. Again, it‚Äôs a process, but I highly suspect it could help OP‚Äôs wife as well."

One of my fluffs is pretty high strung, and has anxiety issues, I'm not 100% sure she would make it a week outside. 

Yeah, I gotta deal with the tri-pod kicking litter out all over the floor, and fur everywhere, but the fur is going to be solvable in a couple of weeks when I get a knock-off roomba, and the litter is a lot better since we switched to a different brand.

"1. The Crusades were a response to barbaric Muslim incursions into Europe.  The Crusaders did terrible things, but they also vanquished barbarians.  They also occurred a millennium ago, the last of which occurred half a millennium ago.

"The point being, if you *say* 8-12 wks, that gives you loads of opportunity to move that date up if it works sooner. If you *say* 2-3 weeks, and your wife or baby have any issues during delivery and have to push it back, there's more chance for stress and issue.

Plus, how your mother reacts to 8-12 weeks will tell you a LOT about her. If she's disappointed, but accepting, great. If she argues, that's a massive red flag.

It boils down to a very simple dynamic: what your wife and baby *need* comes ahead of what anyone else (including yourself, sorry, but you won't be recovering from a major medical event) *want*

Your mother doesn't NEED to be involved at all. Baby will show up regardless of what your mother is up to. Your wife's recovery will happen regardless of what your mother wants.

If you take the perspective of, ""What is the NEED vs WANT?"" you're going to have an easier time deciphering what's the best thing to do. And after that, you go with what your wife WANTS vs anyone else. Again, she's recovering from a major medical event, and that's just regular childbirth, not even looking at serious abdominal surgery (c-section). Plus, if she's nursing, she's on call 24-7. There are hormones, tears, bleeding, flat out damn exhaustion that's physical, mental and emotional.

The WORST possible thing you can do is add another stressor to your wife. It will delay her recovery, it will negatively impact her ability to breastfeed... which negatively impacts your baby.

If you put your wife and baby first, bar none, you're doing the right thing.

And to add: a hotel is a MUST. Your wife will absolutely need privacy and alone time with just her and the baby, and you, her and the baby. Having a guest in the house, even if it's someone that everyone flat out adores, is a stressor. Nobody needs to be hosting anyone in house after giving birth."

"My husband and I got a real kick outta this idea. We both starting Mr. Burns-ing with our hands when I read it out loud.

There are all kinds of gender stereotypes that are played up heavily (and that so many people buy into without realizing it)! If you're looking for some casual mischief in your campaign, I think you could have untold amounts of fun with that alone. Think of every beer commercial, most car commercials, definitely every condom commercial, and just any stereotype that elicits an eyeroll and give it a tweak to suit your adventure.

Some other quick ideas: 

* The adventurer with an overinflated sense of his own prowess/""manliness"" and is gung-ho to get started that he leaves something crucial at home (bandages, weapon/off-hand, bag of holding, his keys, spells)

* Alternately, he thinks he looks/smells fine, runs out the door, and is immediately set upon by bears because they smell trash

* An illusion that makes them all look like women to each other, so they each think they're the only one ""qualified"" to lead the party

* Automatic refusal to ask for advice/directions/assistance for something to go with the ""I'M FINE, I DON'T NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR"" mentality

* Poison or disease causing ""man flu"" symptoms

* A clever (female) proprietor contributing to (but not causing) the downfall of the party after someone tries to mansplain her products to her

"It's probably because they see the west as a place to conquer. The Muslims calling for these sorts of things are usually clerics and not random Muslims off the street. Anyone with power in a religion has a vested interest in pushing it and they'll pick the easier targets. Europe is comparatively easy to force Islamic principles on than China.

Europe needs to insulate itself against this sort of cultural change. There are plenty of issues in Europe but it's an objectively better culture than Saudi Arabia, the nation pushing Islamic agendas hardest."

Or you could go the agent venom route and do as you said but take up 4 slots and in the comic the symbiote buffs any weapon it comes in contact with you would still have all your stated abilities but you would have one buffed weapon. like say you find a pistol and absorbed it each shot would do 10-20 damage more than it's original amount."

As for rehearsal I do have about 80 songs in a playlist for what the setlists would consist of. How much would a rehearsal cost to pay the members? 

""and it also outs off potential customers if you are too low"", are you saying wedding planners do won't hire if prices are too low? Or customers as in professional musicians I would be hiring would not join if prices are too low?

"Scooter was the child of one of the band moms who, if you said a single bad thing about her children than she would attempt to get you kicked out of the band. Anyways, Scooter was one of the worst baritone players in the band, nay the worst band member in the ensemble. She received her nickname one day when she ran off the field and brutally threw her horn, it legitimately scooted across the ground. She would always try to get out of rehearsals by getting ‚Äúsick‚Äù even though she would never actually vomit. The best example of this was when she got ‚Äúparalyzed‚Äù on the field, so two section leaders had to carry her up the hill to the school. Then halfway up the hill her mom told her that she was being dramatic so she immediately stood up and ran off the field. There were many more scenarios such as this. But after many failures to partake in rehearsals she was cut loose. On the day of our first competition she decided to show up in pajamas without knowing even one out of three movements. So our band director told her to leave she told him that she wanted to see the show. To which he responded ‚Äúyou can, in the stands with everyone who isn‚Äôt in the band‚Äù it was amazing."
"Idk about the other user, but those numbers are wrong

Small guys 50. One AR headshot kills. 5 atk

Big guys 250-300. I think its like 5 AR headshots. Or 4. 10 atk

Small purple guys run fast btw. 200. They survive a pump to the face, must be more than 150. 5 atk i think?never got hit by one

Gold guys have way too much. prolly 3k? Not sure. They even have an hp bar. They drop legend weapons tho, but only spawn late game (&gt;30 people i think) 10 atk but jnsta destroy wooden structures

Spawners have 1500-2k not sure. Also have hp bar. Drop chest loot once destroyed. They take weird amounts of damage idk. Pickaxe 75, AR normal, deagle normal, heavy sniper 350... idk numbers for those things. 

They attack builds for no reason whatsoever, even if youre standing right by them. But are tricky to agro off you without placing a build inbetween you and them.

Lots of loot. Basically every 3rd husk gives a floor spawn. No mats tho. All sorts of meds. Suprising chance for chug. Cant tell if blue weapons garanteed or blue weapons only, hmm.

I wouldnt recomend farming at corrupted zone in solos. They not a problem, but as soon as one other player comes, they become a huge problem, as they spawn way too fast with no cap i can see. I think its good to farm isolated ones. And if someone starts shooting you, run as far away from the spawner before reengaging.

"Libertarians are incredibly fascist.  The idea that you chose to be where you are based on pure will and utilized your resources better than others to be in the state you're in fits right along with fascist ideology.  Cream rising to the top of a trash-heap with degenerates not as capable as the captains of industry, held captive by the chains of the state, clamouring for tablescraps from the *true* winners of society.

Of course, they might ignore the repercussions of their political stance and make it economic exclusively:  A minimum of state influence to let the invisible hand of the market efficiently redistribute resources.  This means that the corporations are choked by regulation and the market is unable to right itself (as it *clearly* would, of course).  This thus leads to corporations lording over their serfs in a marriage of corporate and state - the well provisioned corporations forcing the state to comply with their whims in the market when compared to smaller businesses and local elites.  The marriage of corporate and state is also fascism as the mega-corporate structure was and still is nothing more than a pocket of fascism we encourage in our society to harness its production."

"U.S. pot firm Curaleaf to triple planned equity offering -sources
John Tilak, Nichola Saminather

TORONTO (Reuters) - U.S. cannabis retailer Curaleaf Holdings Inc is raising about $400 million, almost three times its original target, in Toronto, in a deal that would value the company at close to $4 billion, people familiar with the situation told Reuters. 

The move by the Wakefield, Massachusetts-based company, which also owns cannabis cultivation operations, comes ahead of going public on Monday in what will be one of Canada‚Äôs largest reverse takeovers. Documents available to potential investors listed the target issue size as $150 million.

Curaleaf‚Äôs strong showing comes as cannabis stocks are taking a beating over concerns that the sector is overvalued. The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF (HMMJ.TO) tumbled 6.1 percent on Wednesday, leaving it 30 percent down from an all-time high it hit the day before Canada legalized recreational cannabis on Oct. 17.


Curaleaf will raise the equity through a private placement that converts to a public company.

The cannabis industry saw a flurry of capital raisings and mergers ahead of the legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada.

The offer is set to be priced at C$11.45 per subscription receipt, near the top end of the previously disclosed range of C$8.56-C$11.47 per receipt, according to one of the people. A subscription receipt can be exchanged for the underlying security upon the deal‚Äôs closing.

Curaleaf‚Äôs fundraising is among the biggest equity offerings in the sector and has attracted more than 100 institutional investors, one of the sources said.

The offer is expected to be priced as early as Wednesday, the people said.

An external spokesman for Curaleaf declined to comment. The sources declined to be named as the matter is not public.

Reverse takeovers (RTOs) allow companies to go public by rolling into a listed shell corporation and typically have a faster timeline than a traditional initial public offering.

RTOs have emerged as the preferred route for most U.S. cannabis companies seeking to go public.
Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF18.66
HMMJ.TOToronto Stock Exchange
-1.21(-6.09%)
HMMJ.TO

    

Curaleaf‚Äôs listing will be the biggest-ever RTO on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), the exchange said.

Curaleaf, which owned 28 dispensaries in nine U.S. states as of Sept. 7, is turning to Canada as a federal prohibition of cannabis in the U.S. makes raising capital there a challenge. It expects to increase the number of dispensaries in its network to 41 by the end of the year.

Currently, 49 companies with U.S. cannabis interests are listed on the CSE, out of a total 106 marijuana issuers, according to data from the exchange. U.S. cannabis listings on the CSE by RTO this year include retail chain MedMen Enterprises (MMEN.CD) and Green Thumb Industries (GTII.CD).

Even though marijuana remains illegal under U.S. federal law, the United States is the world‚Äôs biggest cannabis market, with California alone expected to have sales of $5.1 billion this year, according to Arcview Market Research. Companies are eager to get a slice of that pie.


Investment banks GMP Securities and Canaccord Genuity are leading the offering.

But yeah otherwise you're pretty much right. There are also some bisexuals who use queer because a few troons like to claim that the term bisexual is transphobic because ""it implies there's only two genders uwu"".

However I don‚Äôt always do that.

"I will say that from what I've seen most furries are into yiff. Wether or not yiff is inherently wrong (I don't believe it is) too often people are saying that it's the minority of people into it. That's a pretty bullshit lie from my interactions with the community. While I think we need to work on that, I still have a very positive view of the community. Very few furries are inherently trying to be a degenerates (the rest of us just accept that that is a title that comes with being a furry lel jk). I think we need to work on how we outwardly speak of our fandom. Too often people throw around the terms minority and majority when there hasn't actually been any polling.

"Pre-ordered my sprint iPhone xs max silver 256 and has issues with poor wifi connectivity and poor signal. My calls would drop on a ratio of 3/10. Also noticed when I use apps that have buttons positioned on the top corners of the notch, I have to press them a few times before it works. Also when using apps that require you to use landscape mode, I accidentally close the app when swiping up from mid screen. So I took the phone to apple and they swapped it and told me not to use my back up but to use the phone as factory default to see if my apps were causing the issue but after a week of use, Same problems only worse. My calls dropped 5/10 now. So I went to apple again and they swapped it out once more and said if it gives you problems again you need to contact sprint. So the problem remained the same with the third phone and I contacted sprint. They had me swap out the sim and do a pprl reset and also reset my network channel. They said they are aware of the problem and are trying bits of trials to see what works and for how long. So after the network reset from their end everything seemed better and faster until a week ago. Much much worse network problem. Not only do my calls fail but I now sometimes have zero bars in areas I know has great lte. I‚Äôm tired of complaining about the same problems. Apple looks at like and basically says sorry it ain‚Äôt us. And sprint looks at me and says sorry apple made a shitty product and we trying to fix it but we don‚Äôt know how. So who‚Äôs going to compensate me for my time and money I‚Äôm loosing. "

"YouTube and Twitch are the tiniest tip of the iceberg for online content. Even if you are content to just sit in a chair, throw your face on the screen and play a a video game, you can do it reasonably well on Mixer or even Facebook, believe it or not.

If you're trying to make a living on the internet and ""build a brand"", however, throwing all your eggs in one basket is as bad as an idea as it is for any other industry, modern or otherwise.

It's an odd example but look no further than Ricky Berwick who has a YouTube channel with modest viewcounts, but sees the vast majority of his engagement on Twitter. For all their faults, plenty of people have had success coming from or branching out to Vine (when it existed), TikTok, Instagram, even Snapchat for short-form content.

Podcasts are another great example of content diversification, these are most often at their best when *not* live and they can easily be pushed to a huge variety of podcast platforms, YouTube potentially being the *worst* option that's still technically viable.

Even here, the likes of Uniden and Gallowboob have shown that given enough time, you can even find yourself in a ""professional redditor"" situation though that's pretty outside the realm of what streamers might be interested in.

While not always feasible for discoverability, anyone that can move even a small audience can just throw up a website and do whatever they want while being supported via Patreon. Honestly Patreon is a solid option no matter what in terms of giving your audience a variety of ways to support you.

It's no secret the internet has no shortage of places for people seeking attention to go find attention. The problem is that the ""lets play"" format that 99% of streams fall into has always been heavily saturated and has gotten even moreso in the last ~5 years with how easy it's become to quickly make things.

Anyone struggling isn't suffering from a lack of platforms. They're struggling because they either haven't even considered diversifying, or they lack creativity, ambition, or most often - talent.

I'd love to see more people spread themselves out - hopefully Twitch shooting themselves in the foot like this will be the first step in getting people to start considering it!"

She will have fantasised about your reactions upon getting the order and it will have made her smile, probably a lot like the one she wore at the grocery store. 

They are so caught up in wanting their revenge against their own child, they never ever consider the consequences of the outcome.

"The problem with nuclear, more than anything else, is the toxic public perception of it. Politicians are incredibly hesistant to bring it up because they don't feel like getting beat by sticks on all sides by a misinformed public. No local representatives want to stump for it because there's no better way to get kicked from your seat.

Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of outright hostility to nuclear from out-and-out ""bleeding heart"" type environmentalists. But the reason your Trudeaus or Merkels or whatever centrist politician *du jour* isn't advocating for it has nothing to do with it comes down to that

"The goal of antifa is to stop fascism from gaining power. The quicker you stop fascism, the more effective you're going to be. Antifa acts in order to keep people from taking away the rights of minority groups. They act by disrupting fascist rallies and infiltrating fascist groups to take them down from the inside.

The goal of fascism is to take away the rights of minority groups. By carrying out acts of terror, they are trying to scare people into removing people's constitutional rights.

Carrying out violent terror attacks and organizing violent rallies during which you try to put snipers on a roof to shoot your opponents and plan beforehand to run over counter-protesters with your cars is *vastly* different than counter-protesting in order to stop people form taking away your rights.

I‚Äôm tired of hearing feminists use the word ‚Äúempowering‚Äù. Sleeping with 20 guys is not empowering. Walking around half naked and demanding equal treatment is not empowering. Constantly hating on men for showing any signs of masculinity is not empowering. True female empowerment is embracing your femininity.

"I'd say differently.  People want answers that make sense to them, they genuinely do not understand why evolution works, how the big bang resulted in the universe as it is, and they can't compartmentalize that we only know a small portion of how the universe works.  People want answers, they want them in the most concise way possible.  

There's also the aspect of religion that alleviates the fear of death.  In religion, if you're a good member of the religion, you get to believe that there's a reward for whatever good actions you've taken over the course of your life, and how many people you've helped.  The allure of a promise of ""you will have an eternally happy life"" is enough for most people.  That alone banishes most of the fear of death.  People want to live longer, healthy lives, this appeals to that even more.  

As for people inherently wanting to believe, I'd disagree with that too.  There's been so many searches and abandoned causes for trying to find a part of the brain that ties people into religion innately, but there just simply isn't.  It'd be like saying that people want to go to state fairs, because of some biological part of the brain.  People that are the most faithful are those without a large educational background that have been raised into the religion from a very young age."

As soon as Xi saw good numbers in Beijing, he grabbed factories from behind to cut emissions. China isn't even a fully-developed nation.

South Korea is treated as a hotbed for innovation, but where are the subsidies for renewable energy research? Where are the scholarships for STEM students and the funding projects for clean industry startups? There are definitely better ways to give people jobs that focus on using new technology and employing new industries, but instead Moon is once again trying to roll Korea back to the old days, even if Korea's boom only lasted a day.

It helps some pains people might have, wether that be physical or emotional. It does work well for anxiety, I‚Äôve used it for that a few times.

It‚Äôs a good drug, it‚Äôs mostly legal too so you can get it sent to your house.

Edit: there‚Äôs a lot of misinformation that goes on about it tho because it is a plant and it is legal. A lot of the users see it as a miracle drug but it also has some downsides. You can gain a tolerance and have withdrawals from it just like any other drug. But it‚Äôs very mild, more likened to caffeine dependence and withdrawal. "

"The expat-immigrant divide is clearly a marker of race or nationality, not of immigration policies - where I live, Burmese or Khmer or Laotians coming to Thailand to work temporarily are migrant workers/immigrants, whereas (usually white) Americans and Europeans coming to Thailand to work temporarily are expats. Both are there for equally time-limited periods but from a linguistic point of view, they are anything but equal. And for proof, next time you meet someone who calls him/herself an expat refer to them as an 'immigrant' and watch the reaction. Chances are that that person will not be happy. 

And while dialect/language is not quite as obvious, in this situation it seems to divide on the same lines. After all, the question does not appear to be asking about sub-national varieties of languages so referring to them as 'dialects' does not seem to be justified. "

"When the currents are open, my house mate's cat leaves my curtains alone; he just wants to look out the window. We have a few scratching items around the house, but it is important to know what kind your cat prefers. My old cat would scratch the carpet, but not a vertical scratching post, so while I might like that it takes up less floor space she hated it. When I bought a low lying one my carpet scratching problems disappeared.

Duvet covers might help, with bedding being easier to clean, or keeping pets out of bedrooms, I have yet to succeed at that, and right now they are not even my cats.

There is also soft paws claw covers, but I have never used them, and they need to be replaced as they shed claws. A spray bottle might teach your cats to not do things, or might only teach them to not do it while you are around.

Everything from his history of attending a tourney at like 10~ years old, unhorsing Ser Duncan at 16, saving Aerys and escaping with like two arrows in his back, slaying Maelys(?) the Monstrous by cutting his way through the Golden Company, becoming the LC, his boast about being able to cut through five Kingsguard like butter, and finally going to the 'true' heir of the Iron Throne makes me feel like he's one of the only 'true' knights in the series.

As a test, look how many comics or books were turned into something greated, populated across the world, changed into games, movies, how many foreign books are being read by people; then do the same for poetry. Results will prove that in case of books etc. it's way easier to find a larger audience. Just look at the hype on Lord of the Rings, for example.

"&gt; Do you identify with the Hitler regime 

This is phrased strangely. I identify with their fight with radical jewish supremacy which subverted German society in similar ways it's subverting American society. I identify with their claim that their remilitarization and large scale public works projects had pure motives. I identify with their desire to purge communist radicals seeking to destroy private property and encourage radical anti capitalist sentiments with the goals of wiping out the ownership class of german society. 

I do NOT identify with the caricatures of 'nazis' created by the winners of WWII (see The Myth of German Villainy and books written by authors like Norman Finkelstein and Irving that addresses these systematic falsehoods.)

&gt; and its policies? 

Yes although they'd have to be updated a bit for our modern economy and information age. 

&gt; If so, what policies?

Basically all of them.  I encourage everyone to actually read the points of the NSDAP carefully.  They call for rebuilding of school systems, banking, press and business corrupted by materialism and anti german sentiment.  Sound familiar?

https://www.pdf-archive.com/2016/09/21/25-points-of-the-nsdap/25-points-of-the-nsdap.pdf

IMO the US constitution is a dead document and not actually being followed by our government and elites.  Its original focus and language has been totally subverted and warped and like an old tree bent and twisted by high winds it will be impossible to straightened again. (I highly encourage everyone to watch this speech by Judge Napolitano titled [A Nation of Sheep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN9n6cVQp4I) )

&gt; Are you simply socialists with a national focus?

An ethnic nationalist focus. Yes.  However, some people on the alt right still hold some libertarians views but believe libertarianism only works in overwhelmingly majority white societies. 

&gt; Do you agree with the idea that socialism is simply a step towards a communist society?

Absolutely not.  It reasonable for citizens to want to keep the power of capital in check.  Socialism has only been hijacked by judeo capitalism and judeo bolshevik alliance.  That's why Hitler clearly stated he was a NATIONAL socialist.  He didn't want there to be any room for doubt that he supported private ownership and limited capitalism that doesn't threaten the volk.

In fact he wanted German capitalist to compete on a fair playing field with international capitalists without destroying the german people and german values to do it.

&gt; How does your perception of socialism differ from that of traditional socialists?

Socialism is a broad term hijacked by different political factions.  I see socialism as any step away from laissez faire markets. The degree you step away from these markets and how the markets are being used is where you get all the different varieties of socialism.

&gt; Are you basing your views around the workers owning the means of production or a more top-down societal structure as in 1940s Germany?

Socialism can be either from my perspective.  'Workers owning the means of production' is a jewish canaard to overthrow non jewish power structures and implement jewish power structures.  This notion of the 'workers' having power is always abandoned once jewish bankers and their allies have control over the capital. I'm under the strong impression that jews knew right away that Marxism was a pipe dream but that it's emotional appeal to the poor and working class was incredible strong and jews quickly figured out how best to weaponize Marx's ideas.  Were there radical like the Trotskyites that actually believed in a complete destruction of capital and hierarchy? Sure, but they were always essentially treated as tools.

IMO the only viable form of socialism is hierarchical ethnic socialism in a well defined region. Good fences make good neighbors. I don't believe in international socialism or multicultural open border socialism. 

&gt; Would you agree with internationalists socialism or is a stable nation your end goal?

I think I answered this.

&gt; Do you want social conservatism being enforced by the state

Only in so far as elements that attempt to subvert social conservatism are suppressed severely. The state should only loosely be involved in promoting values.  Values come from the people and religious institutions themselves. 

&gt; in that the goal should be to provide freedom to the individual workers.

My philosophy is that freedom and property is only protected by strong men with guns and a lot of people working together for the good of the hive (i.e. agreeing to trust each other, share values, share language, etc).  Stronger worker bees should be rewarded and weaker worker bees should not. Degeneracy and weakness should never be promoted by the state.  The only people that should protect the weak are women and churches and good samaritans they shouldn't be allowed to use the government to help them protect the weak. The only government welfare should be general welfare for the strength of the volk/people as a whole.

&gt;  Do you believe in a Marxist style view of socialism or do you see it as a separate idea?

Much of Marx's critique of capitalism itself was somewhat accurate but he got human nature dead wrong.  Humans do not default to cooperation when class struggle is lifted. In fact they become weak, lackadaisical, mentally ill, devious, evil, animalistic, and as a result society is destroyed.  They only default to cooperation under the brutal thumb of nature and hierarchy. (The best sports teams have fair but firm coaches) Governments should seek to transfer the natural order of nature (breeding out the weak and rewarding the strong) into government programs. That might sound 'evil' but there are ways to do eugenics peacefully and in a non totalitarian way.  One way is 'anti' dysgenics. Another is paying quality families to produce more children. Another is national fitness and health programs.

"Believe me, it is. And it truly opens up the New Testament.

You see a Jesus for whom none of this politics shit matters. Sure the 1% are ripping off the people, and the priests mere puppets arguing over whether or not you should charge half a shekel or three quarters shekel tithes on mint. Fuck it, let's meet in the public square and, hey, see that old woman over there begging? Let's feed her, give her a place to sit and some new shoes and maybe a place to stay.

We're not going to oppose the powers that be, and we're not going to work with the powers that be. We're going to take the third option. I think ""not of this world"" was the term they used.

You see a man who's trying to get people to see through someone else's eyes. The Centurion not as someone who crucified four people the other day and whose throat you'd cut but for the Legion behind him, but as a tired man doing a hellish job thousands of miles away from home who doesn't really want to be there - and one who, if you carried his burden twice as far as he asked, would be like ""yeah, okay, er, that's far enough, hey, um, sorry"" as opposed to seeing you as someone put on this earth to be underfoot.

Mindfulness. Kindness. Not grasping, worrying about your precious stone building or your nice brooch, when there's a vista of sand and ocean with beauty far beyond anything human hands can fashion.

And it really makes this modern nonsense about handwringing about ""your penis, where to and where not to put it, that's the totality of Christianity"" when there are people literally starving and/or dying from lack of clean water.

"What I would like to have would be lore friendly pistoliers. As young blooded nobles eager to prove themselves, they just charge at the ennemy and discharge their pistols at point blank. In 6 edition, they were a bit like wild riders: fast troops that engage the ennemy in melee and quickly deal burst damage but if you leave them too long in melee, they evaporate. For mobile shooting, outriders just do it better. They would definitely get their niche with that change: give them a buff like +20 attack and armor piercing damage in melee for 15 seconds when in melee, 1 min cooldown, refresh only when not in melee (number to adjust of course). It would open more options to empire gameplay.

A combine arms mechanic or something similar would be interesting to see. In tabletop empire infantry was pretty bad but their use of detachments could give you some serious advantage. It would be nice to have it here. My idea was something different: melee troops attacks give a missile resistance debuff and missile troops shoots give a melee defense debuff. Maybe easier to implement."

It's more so that I'm skeptical and confused then trying to intentionally disrespect anyone who was affected like this.

Sure, what kind of evidence would you accept? Countries that stick to capitalist principles tend to be richer. Countries that move more towards capitalism and market economies increase their standards of living, life expectancy, access to energy and water, etc.

Furthermore, the gains in those kinds of metrics are largely attributed to places like India and China which have moved more towards free market capitalism over the past 40 or 50 years.

&gt;Because they kill people in order to maintain the power structures of capitalism? You're telling me that dictators in central America slaughtering workers to make an example of union organizers trying to get a raise from American fruit companies has nothing to do with capitalism?

yeah. people want things and are at odds with other people, that's not a specifically capitalist phenomenon. murder has nothing to do with capitalism.

&gt;Capitalism happens all over the world, because it is aggressively spread, like a cancer, from western nations through imperialism.

no it happens all over the world because it works and is basically defined by being liberating and fair. Explain to me how property rights and free markets has anything to do with imperialism.

"It depends on which form of Mazandarani it is. I like the distinction my father makes which is that there is mountain mazandarani and urban mazandarani.

"Autofire has a few issues although you may need to find the errata to see them.  For starters the attack still needs to hit REF 10 to get the area and deal half damage if it doesn't hit REF Defenses.  Secondly, have Cover from an AoE's point of origin (which is the shooter for an autofire attack) reduces the damage by half the rolled amount; this means that if the autofire attack HITs the target's REF Defenses they only take half the rolled damage and if it doesn't hit their REF it deals NO DAMAGE even if it would hit REF 10.  

The other big thing about autofire is that if it is used extensively you really should track ammunition.  Standard autofire uses up 10 shots worth of ammo which means a Blaster Rifle only gets to make **5** autofire attacks when starting with a full power pack before it is empty and needs to be replaced/reloaded.  I may not always track ammo when characters get 50 attacks out of a power pack assuming they carry reloads and ammo wouldn't otherwise be restricted but if they can only make 10 attacks or less you'd better believe I'm tracking that.  Repeating blasters can get around the ammo issues by hooking them up to a power generator BUT the generators aren't light and for a given size repeating blasters do a little less damage than a blaster rifle would do.

As for hitting multiple enemies at once this is really all about spacing.  When using AoE weapons don't forget that Friendly Fire can be a thing as well."

"When it goes blank, and I attempt to turn it off via xrandr (because there's still a workspace there), my whole machine freezes and I have to do a hard reset. This is clear indication that there's something else going on.

If I reboot, it might go blank, but it *always* goes blank at the *exact* same moment, and *every time*, from that moment on it either works, or it doesn't, until I reboot. It is not a coincidence.

"So for those who don't know, in football teams that win Champions League, Europa League, Euro Championship, World Cup adds badge to their jersey from competition that they won, and they hold that badge until next competition/winner.  
This makes their jersey a bit more premium/unique, and also good souvenir for fans, since you have badge on it from that year/competition that they won.  
  
Also teams wins World Cup adds little star above their badge for each time they won World Cup, Team Liquid for example did it on [their jersey](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0024/1169/2089/products/TeamLiquid-Artboard_2_Jersey_Male_TI8_Front_grande.png?v=1537829613)"

"I still don't get why they just didn't make a seperate BR game. They have a whole bunch of assets from BF3/BF4 and Hardline for a modern setting. Then just use them to build a big map, or even a few in some of the different settings. Build  much bigger BR version of Shanghai, Los Angeles, the tropical islands, Caspian Border. Then you're good to go! They honestly would just need to expand the customization options from Hardline. Work on the game mode and the engine. Then just don't charge a full game price. I think everyone would prefer this. BR coming to BFV relies on the mode being so great it takes players from normal MP to BR and for people who want BR to then buy a game full of stuff they don't want."

"This makes me think of a quiet psychology professor I had in college.   He was the kind of spacey/dorky type everyone generally liked and respected.  Guy lent me a book one time, that sort of type.

The only time he would ever discipline anyone in class it would be these two basketball players in the row in front of me. They would talk over him, and he would politely ask them to be quiet, after which, they usually would.  The class was small enough where this behaviour definitely wasn't cool, but certainly not unheard of.

This probably happened no more than five times when one day the dude just snapped.  They were talking over him one day when BAM! Prof just started yelling at them to get out. Said they did that shit all the time and to get out of his class and not come back.  Once they left, he shook his head, said ""man, I hate that!"" And went calmly back to teaching."

So you should not be feeling any more scammed than if they just took longer and released 1.0 with all original features - you'll be getting the same product in the same timeframe.

"This is interesting in that the participants have no idea how many are actually participating versus the vote count, let alone how much the pot is or the individual contributions to the pot.

Example:

Pot is 100k total, some crazy gambler whale puts in 400k.

If they get it right, they will get 400/500 (80%) of the winnings.

However, the max they can win back of others' contributions is 80k, but that assumes everyone else was wrong.

The actual amount would be much lower.

If they get it wrong though, they lose 400k.

Placing outsized bets relative to the total value , which they don't know, seems to have low expected value.

For others, a correct whale would greatly decrease their expected value, but a fail whale would greatly increase it.

Absent any whales and provided a consensus, probably won't be much winnings for anyone.

Too bad I wasn't able to track this from the first vote, but I also won't be tracking from here on either.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR, this is actually 2 bets:**

1. The price of ETH.
2. Whether a whale will participate *and* gamble a whale-sized amount *and* whether they choose the correct answer."

He has ED, he has the happy blue pills that usually don't work, and he doesn't like the side effects. I dealt with that for over 10 years, plus his refusal to pursue any other possible treatments, and the real thing is just a general loss of intimacy. He rarely talks to me about anything other than his work. He never touches me like he cares: he might squeeze my boob or butt, but more a possessive thing than a caring thing, and its usually when I'm busy doing something like cooking. He rarely kisses me in a nice way. He's a generally nice guy and a good dad, and I'm not miserable, but I really missed having an intimate relationship. "

"This happened in CoS. 

One of my players had a typical tragic backstory. He lived in a small farming village with his wife and 2 children. One day, his village was raided by Orcs. He was the only one stupid enough to try to fight the orcs off. The leader of the orcs was cruel and prideful, he made the player watch as the orcs burned down the village.

Every night in Barovia, Strahd visited PC in his dreams, replaying the event (adding horrific details) and offering him ""The strength to save those he loved"". If the player refused he made a CON save and depending on how badly he failed, he gained a random madness effect. 

Eventually, the PC broke and accepted Strahd's offer. Strahd turned him into a vampire, PC acted as a spy for Strahd. Later the PC turned against the party in a crucial moment almost causing a TPK."

I have faith that my friend will pay me back $20. It's not knowledge because I don't know for sure that my friend isn't going to skip town or otherwise be unable to pay. But my faith can be based on evidence in the form of past times my friend has been reliable. Faith with absolutely no evidence in that sort of situation would be if I've never met the person I'm lending money and I've never seen proof that anyone has ever paid back a loan. There are always varying degrees of evidence in things we don't know for sure but still believe anyway.
"&gt;1.0 is a milestone by which we can close the bugs and let the community freely mod the game so we can focus on the next free updates and not be buried by thousands of bugs and instability both inside and outside

Read the whole thing. Makes more sense that way.  They want the core game to work, so when they add 1.1 content patch (random number pulled from my ass) it wont break the game rendering it completely useless.

With them knowing the game wont massivly break, it gives them to freedom to not have us bugging them every 10 seconds with a new bug that makes it unplayable...hence they can 'start again' to make big content updates like Tanoa for arma.

IMO, there will be no beta. Beta will be seen as immediately being completed (They did so in alpha) and progressing to Final release, OR it will be beta until the first major DLC (think tanoa for Arma3)


Y'all need to stop fixating on internal terms and jargon like 'beta' 'alpha' and just enjoy whats provided...If you're bored, go play something else.

"Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"I have the following doubts and I am struggling to strengthen my faith:

All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others.

Jesus also taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others.

No sacrifice is necessary for salvation.

No bloodshed is necessary for salvation.

No savior should die for the salvation of others; everyone is responsible for his own salvation.

According to the teachings of all prophets, salvation is based on obedience, repentance, and forgiving others - if we forgive people, God will forgive us. 

Jesus has confirmed the same in Matthew 18:21-35, 6:14-15, Mark 11:25-26, and Luke 6:36-37

The only exceptions are the teachings of Paul who was not educated by Jesus and who taught the original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God‚Äôs law.

Jesus did not teach that a man is justified according to God‚Äôs plan or by faith without the deeds of the law; In Matthew 16:27 and John 5:29, Jesus has confirmed that God will reward each person according to his deeds; those are the basic teachings of the old testimony like the verses taught in Psalm 62:12, Ecclesiastes 12:14, and many other old testimony verses. 

The teachings of Atonement were taught by Paul in [Ephesians 1:7](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Ephesians/1/7), [Colossians 1:13-14](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Colossians/1/13), [1 Corinthians 15:3](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/1-Corinthians/15/3), [Romans 4:25](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Romans/4/25), [Galatians 1:4](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Galatians/1/4), [1 Corinthians 5:7](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/1-Corinthians/5/7), [Ephesians 5:2](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Ephesians/5/2), [Ephesians 1:7](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Ephesians/1/7), [Colossians 1:13-14](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Colossians/1/13)

But Paul failed to teach the wise teachings of Jesus

When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of Atonement they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost

The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures

Hebrews 9:22 ‚Äúwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness‚Äù is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:11 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who do not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health

The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers

Proverbs 16:6 teaches that ‚ÄúIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.‚Äù

Psalm 69:30-31 teach that praise worship is better than sacrifice

2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without blood sacrifice

‚ÄòIf my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin‚Äô

Jonah 3 teach that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood

Proverbs 17:15 states:

‚ÄòHe who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination unto God‚Äô

That should be considered as a warning to the teachers who promise free salvation to the sinners and who teach that the innocent has been punished on behalf of the sinners

Jesus taught the parable of The Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32 to highlight the importance of obedience and repentance as the main pre-requisites for salvation

That is the core Christianity teaching as taught in Matthew 7:21 Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven

Jesus has confirmed the teachings of the Old Testimony ‚Äòin repentance and obedience is your salvation‚Äô as taught in Isaiah 30:15

In Matthew 25:31-45 Jesus described the final judgment as being based on good works; he clarified that those who obey the law will be saved

Salvation is not based solely on belief and nothing else; salvation is not granted to those who merely profess acceptance of Jesus without performing kind or compassionate deeds

Jesus did not teach that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law; In Matthew 16:27 and John 5:29, Jesus has confirmed that God will reward each person according to his deeds; those are the basic teachings of the old testimony like the verses taught in Psalm 62:12, Ecclesiastes 12:14, and many other old testimony verses

In Luke 13:3 and 13:5, Jesus taught that repentance is necessary for salvation

But unless you repent, you too will all perish

Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one‚Äôs neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices

What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6

‚ÄòFor I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings‚Äô

That verse teaches us that forgiveness is possible by repentance and obedience; no sacrifice is necessary

Matthew 9:13 teaches that Jesus came to call the sinner to repentance

‚ÄòI desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance‚Äô

"You are correct, that's my bad.  There is spell ""forgiveness"" for spammable abilities, but it doesn't strictly allow for holding a key.  Humans can't perfectly time spell casts on cooldown, so we've implemented a ""window"" during which you can lay into a button and have the game do it for you when the spell becomes available.  This doesn't apply to Eve anymore (since her rework), and a better example would've been Karthus' Q.

"Yeah, it probably does. And I think people should act conscious and just not watch videos like these.  To give an hyperbolic example: child pornography only exists because people watch it. If nobody watched it, it wouldn't exist.

Here you can say that these people record these videos because they believe they can sell the video to news agencies or maybe milk it for karma/views/likes on social media. The only way to prevent it is to make people realize that just ""watching a gore video because it's interesting"" is the reason these videos exist in the first place. If nobody watched ISIS propaganda videos, they'd probably doing them (at least other than for recruiting). 

People should actively avoid any materials (videos or anything really) that were obtained by harming other people. No matter how interesting or something might be and no matter how curious you are. Stopping that habit is a simple way to make a slight change in the world imo. Of course this is easier said than done. I'm more than likely a hypocrite for writing this on a Samsung that was probably created by using child labour or exploiting materials from African economies or other fucked up things.

**That's dangerous bullshit**. The first minutes after the medical event (e.g. cardiac arrest) are the most important ones for long-term perspective. With each minute passing, the chances of the patient making a recovery or even wake up again drop significantly.

"I've trained martial arts for over 15 years, and actively in sparring setting for 5 years (I'm too old now)

When training the kung Fu forms, we learned them solo and with a partner. So one person plays the A role, the main form, and the other plays a B role, the defensive responses to the form.

When you train these you use force but you learn to aim short or wide or pull your punch etc. When it's done hard and fast it looks pretty real and you get welts and bruises. 

So the movie scenes are choreographed in the same way... You go hard and fast and you can definitely get hurt with a ""missed"" punch (or it lands and isn't supposed to)

This is why I LOVE kung Fu movies cause I appreciate the intensity and physical demand it takes to do those huge sequences and scenes... Just doing my first form is exhausting in full speed.... These guys do full scenes like that... With far more acrobatic choreo.

I assume there's going to be an extremely thorough forensic analysis by the FBI; if these bombers are so incompetent that all their bombs were found/detected, and none detonated, it seems likely that they may have left forensic evidence as well.

It's only day 4 of my fat loss endeavor. I'm in a 500 cal deficit at 3000 calories per day and my body is telling me I am starving. When I first started three years ago I had to eat 2000 calories per day to lose weight. How the fuck did I ever survive that?

I don't want to sound ungrateful or anything, but there are some text bugs. After opening the first locker, the one after the person unlocks a door early in the game, there's some text that stays on the screen. I'm playing via GDEmu.

Other than that, no - obviously transactivism and pedophile organisations aren‚Äôt equivalent. For one, it‚Äôs okay to be trans and trans people require legal protections, so there‚Äôs a valid reason for the activism to exist in the first place. Any pedophile activism that isn‚Äôt focused on getting them help so they don‚Äôt offend is a net negative to society because it normalises harming children. [This paragraph was edited for clarity.]

But, the issue of pedophiles being able to slide under the radar by crying homophobia is worth remembering in all social justice contexts, however, because it reminds you that 1. you should examine every aspect of an issue/situation yourself, not just roll over because you might lose precious Woke Points, and 2. there is no ‚Äúright side of history‚Äù, unless humans have gone extinct (at which point it hardly matters) because history keeps going and cycles around. Yesterday PIE, today MAPs, tomorrow a different pedophile Trojan horse. Don‚Äôt worry about history, worry about letting people get hurt because putting yourself out there is just too hard."

Creating confusion about your identity and motives is one way to keep investigators off your trail. Or at least, that's their rationale. If law enforcement really does think it's probably ISIS and you're a nerdy white guy, they're going to spend less time investigating nerdy white guys.

Jack didn't have any wins so far really. He fought for days with Inu/Viper, which is impressive, but which also means he didn't beat them in that time. Then he clashed head on with Fujitora and Sengoku, which also is impressive, but he didn.... etc etc

The other two calamities will still have that 'invincibility aura' as we haven't seen them neither win or lose, but Jack already had his L's (against stronger opponents tho ofc) while still haven't actually beaten anyone.

"Agreed, Peterson was thinking bigger picture;

Dems think they win, Republicans eliminate a talking point going into mid terms, Republicans still get a Republican in the SCOTUS, and it would hurt the Democrats more if Kavanaugh was proven innocent yet forced to step down, or if they tried the same tactic with another candidate.

Pretending that Peterson shilled is being massively disingenuous, or took his comments only at face value.

Fullscreen gives the game some degree of exclusiveness over the hardware and alt+tab becomes a complicated process wraught with peril (e.g. your mouse issues).  Borderless avoids that and in modern iterations is just as good for most players.  In borderless you can have windows and notifications in front of the game as it's being handled like just another window.

It's not even that I asked advice on how to help my brother understand what he does wrong, but the fact that those people told me it's not my place and I shouldn't do anything or saying my parents were fine/in the right. Also, condoning corporal punishment too - it was a mess. Thank you for actually seeing things clearly!

Oh yeah of course, I don't want to be his parent. I never asked to have responsibility of him and I don't wanna discipline him like HOW DARE YOU GET IN TIMEOUT RIGHT NOW and scream at him or whatever. I never even said ""I want to parent my brother"" etc. etc. I just asked for a way I could tell him off that would be appropriate or just find a way to show him it's wrong. Not full on discipline (even if my parents expect me to do that as well), because I didn't want him to get away with causing harm to others. 

However, I think what you suggested is right up my alley. I think my brother really does get the short end of the stick in terms of having shitty parents and quite a low social life. So being closer to him will probably make him happier. I think he is pretty fond of me but letting him know I'm there for him will be good too."

"I'll give you a point there but I still wouldn't see everyone rocking distortion cannons and field emiters. Even for a TL5 society it seems like a little bit too much on the cost benefict. Sheer rifles maybe, even then I cannot look at any of the weapons and say, this is what the military probably uses. These weapons and what they are designed for is not for mass military use at all.

Sheer rifles are assassin weapons no matter how you look at them. They have a small mag, they are completely silent too and they have no recoil.

Thunder guns are again very low ammo and meant to be used against structures primarely. It's not that I don't see the military using it but I see them using it the same way you'd use a rocket launcher, not as a grunt infantry gun.

Distortion cannons again are too low ammo for the average grunt and the use of them is to take out things that are heavily entrenched without causing damage to structures. So the exact opposite of the thunder gun. They are meant for when you can't be breaking shit because you need it intact.

If you look at both TL3 and 4 they have weapons that are obviously meant for grunts. Like laser rifles and mag rifles and combat rifles. Technically the mag rifles has the same ammo as the sheer gun but it's not meant to operate silently and is more powerful on a per shot basis unless you burst fire which you normally should but then your ammo doesn't lasts at all.

Perhaps the problem is that TL5 weapons are not meant to reflect what a normaly soldier would use but rather specialist weapons only. This is why I still see them being equiped with TL4 gear except for special forces.

In the case of armor, as I said i don't see field emiters being used by every grunt, it's an absolutely astonishing piece of gear whose reproduction costs are well above the value of a grunt in the army. These are probably special forces only.

Then we look at storm armor and I I still feel this is probably left for the bigger boys too. We're talking combat veterans and such, people who are experienced and can get the job done.

Assault suits would probably be the base for grunts. While they are TL5 they seem far more appropriate. In general you'd expect a TL4 world to have combar field uniforms as a base and assualt suits meant only for the very best troops out in the field and important people so seeing these as the standard in a TL5 society makes a lot of sense.

Vestimentums are just ceremonial armor, you'd expect to see certain officers that don't actually take to the field, possibly high profile politicians and such using it for both protection and as a measure of status. They aren't meant for the the grunts at all."

The latter has a lot more modernist existential tension, let‚Äôs say and reflects post WWII Japanese psychology much more explicitly. Mishima was a well known political reactionary and nationalist but I find very little in these two books at least that advocates any politics clearly. Its mostly aesthetics if anything in the writing. There are youtube docs and the Paul Schrader biopic if that has you curious.

A kind of left theory book I have been trying to get through for years, yet recommend a lot based on respected acquaintances who like it is ‚ÄòMale Fantasies‚Äô by Klaus Theweleit. It‚Äôs a close study of German Fascist psychology between the wars.  Apparently the approach is ‚ÄòReichian‚Äô as in Wilhelm not the Nazis heheh to some extent. I have only ever gotten through the first chapter of the first book, which close reads a selection of letters from the front of members of an interwar German paramilitary group whose name escapes me. I bet some people on this sub have actually read it. Lots of cool pics too!

Edit: Mishima was popular in his day and his books seem to be in a lot of local library system. Male Fantasies is harder to get, you may have to use inter library loan or shell out for used copies (two books)"

"I play modern and the ""do I try to mana screw them?"" question that Marshall brought up in the genius or grifter comes up pretty often, legally, with thoughtseize and inquisition of kozilek.

It's a lot more complex than Marshall made it out to be. Sometimes their entire hand is too powerful so you disrupt their mana and hope they never draw out of it, but if you have a good hand (or if they have a bomb that you have no answer to), it's often correct to leave their mana sources alone and just take the best card, because you're confident in the ability of your hand/deck to beat their hand once the best card is taken out. This is a huge simplification, entire articles have been written about what you should select with discard spells.

Bottom line is that a good opponent will leave you with the hand that maximizes the odds of them beating you. Intentionally drawing extra cards is clearly a grift because it's against the rules (even if you call a judge on yourself afterwards), but it's a grift that actually lowers your odds of winning."

"&gt;you think organizing and donating and voting is useless?

It is, if the only thing it's going towards is *maybe* holding Trump *et al* accountable.

Seeing some policies that make efforts to avoid this situation would be great! Not just wimpy nods towards sorting out *some* gerrymandering and other issues that should never have been a problem in the first place!

&gt;So what? We're never going to convince them.

It's not about convincing the zealots, it's about talking PAST them. Talk about workers rights in a way that makes sense to people. There are serious issues in the US around healthcare, wages, pensions, education and employment. Take on the propaganda of the right head on, stop being so afraid of being called 'socialist', they're going to fucking smear you anyway! This is actually a good chance to stop being afraid of the right-wing media. Their talking points are bullshit and melt away if, and only if, you present a workable solution and stand by it. Don't get gish-galloped or put up with bad faith debaters.

&gt;What's left? Violent revolution? Is that really what you're hoping for?

At this point I'll take something that works. Not a 'moral victory' of tutting loudly while racist filth locks toddlers in cages and puts them on show trails.

Look at it this way, if a valid alternative to this fails to show up, a violent revolution might look like heaven compared to what could come next. And how confident are you about the midterms exactly? What are you going to do if it's ambivalent, or worse?"

"&gt; Just because a person likes all breast sizes doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna specifically seek out small boob forums.

I could be misreading the OP's post but I don't think she's saying that men should only seek out forums or subs for small boobs. If the whole ""all boobs are good boobs"" BS was true then why wouldn't there be around the same amount of subscribers and content in small boob forums as there is for large boobs? Then there's subs/forums for just boobs in general. Those subs/forums are often filled with mainly big boobs and seeing anything like a B or smaller isn't common. 

I think that's what the OP was referring to but I could be wrong. 

&gt;And just because not everyone has a preference for small boobs doesn't mean they won't find them attractive when presented with them.

I think something like this would be true for someone who doesn't have a specific preference for boob size but if a guy likes them big, which most do, then there's a very big chance that a small set just won't do anything for him. Just do a search for small boobs in subs like r/relationships or r/sex to see what I'm talking about.

"I'm a bit confused as to what you're getting at so I might be missing your point, but coming from someone that does not like GVF in the slightest, even though I love rock in pretty much all forms and eras, is because of how blatantly they're ripping off one specific band. Like, it's not even, say, a doom metal band where it roots back to Sabbath obviously, but some take more from Pagan Altar or Candlemass or something; no, this is a glorified cover band that is making millions. The popularity is another thing; there's so many brilliant artists cutting their teeth trying to get some sales and these guys playing and dressing like Zeppelin are the ones heralded?

IMO, a great example of a modern rock band that does their own thing but is still unmistakably rock is Royal Blood. They're not breaking too much new ground, but they certainly have a sound, they play kickass songs and put on great shows, and they certainly deserve the fame they've gotten so far. You can trace back influences with them, but it all comes together in its own relatively unique package. You can't say that about GVF."

I'm not a student anymore. I know the school does take this seriously. The freshman success seminar and peer mentors exist to try to combat stress and isolation. I agree that not enough is done for the surviving students. There were very few campus wide emails when someone passed when I was in school but many suicides. I don't think that the entire campus necessarily needs to be notified of every tragic and extremely personal event. But we knew it happened and keeping quiet often felt like pretending it didn't happen which isn't good either. I don't know enough to know the right way to deal with this kind of situation.

"If you don't have a Buzzard, I highly recommend it.  Makes running VIP, Terrorbyte jobs, and bunker resupply much more convenient.

When you are registered as CEO or VIP, you can call a Buzzard to you from VIP Vehicles for free, with a 2 minute cooldown between calls (or it being destroyed).  It spawns right next to you, immediately.  It's not a Personal Vehicle so you can have it out along with your own vehicle.  If you aren't CEO or VIP you can call Pegasus on phone and they'll put one at a nearby airfield for you.

You might be able to get a cheap Nightclub + Terrorbyte, and run 50 Terrorbyte Client Jobs during the double pay will get you to $3MM.  You can do 4-6/hour (paying $60-66k each time), interspersed with VIP Work.

Bunker is also really good income, *if* you have both production upgrades (~1.6MM for both) - then you can Buy Supplies rather than stealing them.  A single $75K resupply gives you $140K in stock after 2 hours and 20 minutes with both upgrades, which will sell to Los Santos for $210K.  Let it build up to no more than $175K so you get a single vehicle sale, if you forget and get a multi vehicle sale just find new session and you only lose 5-10% stock.  Don't cheap out, avoid the ones in the far north, they are too far and you will fail sells to Los Santos on time limit."

"Your submission has been removed.  Any questions you may have are very likely answered here. **You MUST fully read this response before messaging the moderators.**

**Removal Reason:** The automoderator bot has auto-removed your post because your account is new on Reddit.  As stated in the subreddit rules (see below), new accounts are not allowed to post in this subreddit. Post removals for new account status is a common practice on reddit and is implemented as a preventative measure. Newcomer posts are most often spam OR they contain other rule violations by newcomers who have not realized they need to read the rules before posting.   

**Subreddit Rule:** brand new accounts, low karma accounts, and those who have not participated in the comments of other /r/solar posts will not be able to make new posts in this subreddit.  

**What can you do?**

* **Get to know the place a bit more first** - Before submitting posts to this subreddit, spend a few more days familiarizing yourself with the site and the subreddit.  You are encouraged to participate in the comments of other posts as you will also need to have some comment karma in order to post in this subreddit.  Always read subreddit rules before posting.

* **Use the Shedding Light post (DING DING DING!)** - while new accounts cannot post, you always have the option to participate in the comments, including the *Shedding Light* post normally found at the top of the subreddit. That post is for you to ask the community any questions you may have which pertain to solar.

* **Request an appeal** - BEFORE asking, see the restrictions on appeals listed below as there are no exceptions.  You MUST include a link to the post you are appealing for.  Appeal by kindly messaging the moderators of this subreddit (see link in the 'Moderators' section of the sidebar)

 ***You may not request an appeal if ANY of the following are true (no exceptions);*** 

 * your account is less than a week old
 
 * the post contains a link
 
 * the post contains an image or text from your own blog

 * you want an exemption because you have another account on reddit. The age of any other Reddit accounts is not a factor since the age rule is based on a per-account basis.  
 
 * the rule applies to you but you just want an exemption anyway
 
 Appeals which do not qualify will be denied.

**If you ARE submitting a link to your own site/article/video/blog/works** - Post removal appeals by new account holders to sites or content which they are affiliated with will not be approved. In the future, keep in mind that you must follow the 9 to 1 rule for posting to the front page; %90 non-promotional participation for the %10 promotional submissions. NO exceptions will be made for SPAM / self-promotion posts from new account holders. ***Repeated failure to follow this guideline will not only lead to a ban of your account(s) but your site(s) as well***.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/solar) if you have any questions or concerns.*"

If you see a comment or post that breaks the rules, please report it to the moderators. This helps keep the subreddit clear of rule-breaking content.

If you're in the US, I'd suggest you apply for SSI. You will need to call the social security department and get an appointment, they only offer to apply for SSA online (work-related disability). After that, they'll put you through a process of getting medical records (list everything, therapists, medical, any hospitalizations for mental illness, etc). It's... a long process. Usually it takes months, and most of the time you are denied several times and have to appeal each time before you are accepted. It might take a year or more if they finally deem you accepted. Good luck, man, just hang on and keep trying.

In the meantime, look for possible charities or programs in your area that can help you with rent or food or what have you. They're out there, explain your situation and ask for help. I know I myself hate to ask for help, but just keep in mind that it does not make you weak or any less of a person. Everyone needs help sometimes."

"In the beginning, there was only one reality. One that had been crafted with love and care, and watched over by a fair and just god, who dispensed his gifts as he saw fit. And one day in this singular universe, there was a man named Dave. He had been given a peculiar gift, one that made it so whatever he tried, he would find himself average at it. It did become a little tricky when he discovered that he could both be average at being able to do something, yet average at not being able to do it, but in time he could control it. Yet it was only about 20 years into his life when he decided to try something. An experiment of sorts, to try and apply his ability to his own existence.   
That was where the trouble began.   
Dave became averagely good at existing and averagely good at not existing at the same time. It wreaked havoc on the universe, and the sheer power of such an event caused Dave to lose control of his very being. He became average at being everything imaginable and average at not being everything imaginable, and the threads of the universe unraveled further and further as the universe's God tried to fix things, even as his  own existence came into question. The entire universe was thrown into a quantum superposition of uncertainty, until a higher being descended from his plane with a solution:    
The universe was split into an infinite mass of parallel universes, each born from the chaos of certainties and uncertainties that Dave had caused. No one knows who or what the higher being that came down was, with some saying that the higher being had always been there, while others say that the being was Dave, and that he had managed to master his powers in order to save reality. None truly know what happened to the first God or to the higher being, but the one thing that is known is that in every universe, there is a Dave who is perfectly average at exactly one thing.

Not really all that much of a story, more a world that I came up with, if y'all have any criticisms I'd be glad to hear them."

""Now King Arthur's son is a woman? And even gets stupid mad when that fact is brought up?""

""Emperor Nero was a blond woman too. Of course.""

Then I saw some video where a heroic spirit who was already shown to have been a man before he died and also brought back once as a male heroic spirit is brought back as a female version of himself who didn't know anything about the male version of herself. And there was a doujin where King Arthur says that she was brought back by the grail as a woman and was in fact a male in life. (But how much stock can you put into a doujin's canonical accuracy?) 

Finally, Daitomodachi made a hilarious video wherein female King Arthur asked Merlin to give her an anotomically functioning male reproductive system so that she could sire an heir to the throne and not have to go through pregnancy herself.

"Ive never done meth so i cant comment on that. However i do like to grab a little hard on the weekend and occasionally during the week. I kind of wondered what makes people walk and talk funny because it doesnt happen to me. Granted i try and keep it to a small amount so i sleep that night. Sometimes i will lose a nigjt of sleep and on rare ocassions maybe 2 nights or like sleeping an hour or 2 over a few days. When ends up happening to me is a will start to see black spots. This is when i know i have to sleep. .in fact i feel like the Hard come down isnt as bad as powdered coke. Yea i might feind for it more but when i come down off regular coke i always feel like absolute shit physically. I pretty much always have a little landing gear so its normally a smooth transition from hard to a bump or small line of H and off to sleep. If its blow its an hour or longer of feeling like shit, my sinus fucked up and hard time getting to sleep.  Ive never gotten to that point of being geeked out or paranoid though. I love to sleep and need it regularly. So staying up for more then 2 days isnt appealing. So i dont think id really enjoy meth. 

Even when sober driving tired is the most dangerous thing ive ever done. I have a long commute for work and the drive home with traffic with lots of sun will put you to sleep fast. So i try not to put myself in that type of situation. Ive also learned to stop and grab a drink and a snack and chill for a few min and ill either fall asleep fast  or snap out of it and its safe to go again. Ive never once used and gotten behind the wheel and felt out of control any way whatsoever. I dont shoot up or nod out as i like small doses so im never impaired. If i got something strong it would hit me long before i drove. I try to avoid using in my car or if possible even having shit on me when im driving. This has served me well over the years. I have to bring shit to work but its long gone before the drive home.

 So many times ive been tired and just for normal reasons and it scares the shit out of me. Also driving in full blown withdrawal is also scary and something i try to avoid at all cost. Once the vomiting starts i cant get behind the wheel or i have to hope im close to home."

"12 man, 0.5 PPR, 0.5 1st down, TE premium scoring, $1000 team salary

If I've got 2 1st round picks for next year...

Who should I target to buy with them or one of them? Maybe stack a player + a 1st to upgrade/save on budget?

Or should I hold on to them?

I only have 2 1sts and 1 3rd for next year. The 2nd became a 1st when I traded Melvin Gordon for David Johnson, the 4th was for James Washington.

Starting Lineup:

- QB: Carson Wentz - $156
- Super Flex: Phillip Rivers - $40
- RB: David Johnson - $205
- RB: Jordan Howard - $125
- WR: Mike Evans - $104
- WR: TY Hilton - $135
- WR: Chris Godwin - $7
- TE: Zach Ertz - $120
- Flex: Phillip Lindsay - $1
- Flex: Austin Ekelher ($18) or Jordan Reed ($24)

As you can see, my starting lineup has ate most of my budget. Will probably have to cut an expensive player next year because of the 10% annual salary increase.

Should I trade Jordan Howard for a 1st?"

"I don't want to be *that guy*, but if I were your doctor I would be seriously concerned.  The adderall is almost certainly impacting your ability to fall asleep.  Even if you manage to get to sleep with the ambien, the quality of sleep is going to be pretty much worthless.  If you continue to take both long term, your days might start feeling like you just pulled an all-nighter and then pounded coffee to wake up.  You'll be very awake, but very tired.  You'll have a hard time focusing and will feel extremely burnt out.  When you stop taking the ambien, you won't be able to sleep at all.

Adderall is bad enough to be taking long-term.  I would suggest you read some of the stories in this sub about trying to get off Ambien.  It is really intended for short-term use only (jet lag, have to go to bed while it's still light out to get up extra early, etc.).  While this sub is cavalier about Ambien use (and I have been in the past) keep in mind that it is an addictive drug and insomnia sucks, but it sucks worse when you have a pill next to your bed that you can pop to make it all go away for tonight, but you can't because it's destroying your life."

"Wait, so when you say blunt do you mean a weed cigarette/joint with a paper wrap? I know that a blunt in the UK/Europe is different than in the US.

If you're using normal rolling papers and no tobacco, I'd say you should slow down, and make sure you're not consuming alcohol with your reefer. In my experience, weed has only made me throw up when I mix it with booze, or when I smoke too much too fast and end up coughing until I throw up. 

If you are using cigar wraps, I'd say stop doing that. Nicotine causes nausea in moderate to high doses. I've gotten a little nauseous from smoking blunts (the US sense) in the past, especially after I stopped smoking cigarettes."

"&gt;considering the environmental impact of industrial farming food waste also means more CO2 in the atmosphere from shipping, farming, and supporting farming.

This isn't a capitalism issue.

&gt;That speaks more to the individual's use of food... which is a separate problem from the industry overproducing food.

There is no such thing as overproduction, just misallocation.

&gt;Sure... but if 50% of the code you write consists of functions that are never called then I would say that most of that code is ""wasted"".

That's not a good analogy, though.

&gt;Anyone who has bought bread from the bread isle and not directly from the bakery has bought bread that was more then a day old.

Well then it doesn't sound like there's any big problem here.

&gt;It increases profits... the food is cheap and can be easily thrown away.

If the food is so cheap, why are there large portions of the population struggling to afford it?

&gt;What do you think ""people needing food but are unable to get it"" means? That means food insecurity, hunger, and starvation.

Only if using some grain to feed cattle leaves an insufficient amount to feed all the people.

Which brings us back to the same question: Why would there be one group of people rich enough to afford beef, and another group of people too poor to afford grain? And if there are such groups, why do we have any responsibility to provide grain for the second group?

&gt;That would be the case yes.

So...why?

&gt;It is more profitable to grow food for the wealthy then it is for the poor.

That doesn't answer the question. Why not grow food for *both?* Once you're done selling food to the wealthy, why not grow more and sell it to the poor?

&gt;That's a fairly crude way to put it, but we are all sentient beings sharing the same planet.

How does that create any moral obligation for us to help each other?

&gt;Compassion and such.

Does compassion come with any particular moral implications? Is it more than just a way that (some) people feel about (some) other people?

&gt;Our stone-age ancestors faced hunger and starvation.

Occasionally, but by-and-large they seem to have produced enough food to get by, because they didn't go extinct.

&gt;I didn't say that we were producing less food. I said that people were unable to afford food.

But how does that work? Why don't people who can't afford food just start doing whatever it is that cave men did in order to produce food for themselves?

&gt;If you goal is maximizing profits.

It's not just profits, but all production. In fact, the general progress of civilization tends to eventually make profits a *smaller* portion of the economy than in the past. And I'm okay with that. (Well, at least as compared to the alternatives.)

&gt;What if your goal is feeding people?

Why wouldn't it be profitable to feed people?

&gt;That's an essential component of capitalism.

No, it isn't. Capitalism is about *capital.* (It's right there in the name.) It's not about externalities.

&gt;And paying more rent means getting less profit.

Yes, but this is kind of irrelevant because you don't get a choice. The values of natural resources and capital are determined by the market.

&gt;All well and good for speculation, but our world isn't infinite.

My point is about the principle of the matter: How rent and profit are not the same thing.

&gt;But it isn't reflected in their margins. You can say ""well it is rent"" when they aren't paying any money on it.

I know. That's not the point. The point is that this isn't a capitalism issue."
"I remember when arrow came out it was so enthralling. I watched season one several times. The first few episodes were especially great. 

I kind of got a taste of that slightly grittier street level super hero and it actually worked and didn't seem too silly while still being a ridiculous super hero show. 

Of course that all fizzled out eventually as they no longer had an origin story/rise to heroism plot. It became very soapy and silly. 

Then DD S1 released. And it kind of made me jaded. It destroyed my ability to enjoy a ton of content that was out at the time. Even Avengers 2 was completely tainted by my mindset after DD S1 had released. 

I'm not mad about this. DD is a precious gem in the MCU and I love that it raised my expectations for more grounded human stories. And very character driven content. Of course it helps that they happen to use my favorite and most underrated and misunderstood character to accomplish this. 

RIP me ever getting into Arrow again tho. "

It's more difficult for hunter to be dick since it would waste their time.  
Survivors usually mock hunter only when they can exit anytime they want. ( AKA, they've already won anyway )  
Hunters can bully a survivor too, but if they do that during the game, other survivors would decode and exit while he's doing that.  
If the hunter only bully the last survivor when he's sure that he's already won, that survivor could just surrender directly, Hunters can't do the same as they have to wait for 8 ( now 7 ) minutes in order to surrender.

&gt;..that's not healthy in any way shape or form. Like at all. That's literally how people end up addicted to all sorts of things and/or end up committing suicide. So that's not a good idea either. If the goal here is to help those with mental illness or problems in general....attempting to gatekeep it and no true scotsman this stuff will literally make just about everything to do with it mountains worse.

He never said don't seek real help.  And TBH most real sufferers don't want anyone to know, because unlike the frauds, they aren't claiming a disease for cool points or sympathy.  They're not trying to use their illness as a go to excuse for not doing things.  

And the issue here is just like a thousand other social problems-- the more people fake having the problem, the faster compassion fatigue sets in.  If there was one person in an office who has a mental problem, that would probably be happy enough to do whatever they had to to accommodate that one person.  Once that one person is joined by 10 others, in any social setting, it's just too much.  And if one of the 10 turns out to be faking, the rest will remember that.  And if it happens enough, they react with suspicion and are less likely to offer help.  


&gt;With that said..has it ever occurred to you that maybe.....just maybe...more people have mental health issues and problems with anxiety and depression than anyone previously thought?

Has it occurred to you that there are a lot of people who will game the system if it gives them a leg up?  Especially since a lot of Mental Illness can be considered job protected.  And that especially since jobs don't last as long as they used to, anything that comes with job protection is going to be seen as desireable.  


&gt;That maybe...just maybe there are things...systems...expectations within humanity that heavily influences and maybe even causes those things on a regular basis?

Maybe, or maybe, just maybe there are institutional biases that make it easy and desirable to be mentally ill.  As I mentioned, a lot of learning disabilities and mental illnesses are covered by ADA, and thus it provides a bit more job security, plus extra help and so on.  And the way that mental illness is diagnosed is pretty much a checklist-- and that this is the only thing.  Plus that checklist is available online.  


&gt;Cause i mean, imagine being a super religious person. Someone who was born into a devout religious family. Someone who lived their entire lives in a very specific way and then all of sudden their attractions start to change. In such a way that is without doubt against the rest of their life. Couldn't that alone cause some massive problems?

Anything *could* cause problems.  That's kinda not the issue.  The issue is whether you're dealing with a person with those problems, or a guy who had no such issues, but went looking for diagnosises so as to garner sympathy and demand support that should be reserved for people with real problems?  I don't think we suddenly have 25% of the US population depressed and anxious.  I think we have about the same numbers as we always have, plus a lot of normal people who want to be sick because they get sympathy and help and attention.  "

"Welcome to the wonderful world of risk assessment. Where you have to figure out what the chances are of the worst coming to pass, and whether or not the proposed methods of reducing CO2 will cost far more than it would even if the worst would come to pass. All with flawed models!

From what I've seen, doing anything to majorly reduce CO2 emissions would cripple the economy and industry, and even the worst of the worst won't actually be too bad in the grand scheme of things. Though, as I've said, it's based on flawed models. I just have to go with the models I think are the least flawed, and now we've gotten into the fuzzy realm of opinions about facts. The only way for me to be relatively sure of *my* opinions on the facts would be to get a doctorate in economics and climate science, at which point I'd still just be adding my own voice to argument. And that's not a career I personally want. That said, I still try to be at least reasonably competent in those fields. Especially economics, because economics applies areas far outside of climate change.

In short, there is no ""solution."" Most proposed major solutions could destroy industries without another way to get power, and the proposed minor solutions just don't do much if anything, even from the point of view of alarmists. That said, I'm more afraid of the major solutions destroying our industries now than of climate change maybe destroying our industries later, as we don't know what technologies we'll come up with. That's also why I'm so supportive of proactive solutions instead of reactive ones. The current power system is broken, and not just because of climate change. Instead of reacting to something that may not be as bit of a problem as expected and trying to put a bandaid on the system, be proactive and support new systems that will benefit humanity regardless of how much of a threat climate change is."

Even if it's only a small minority unfortunately they're extremely Loud. And annoyingly it seems like everyone is willing to listen to them. Or at the very least cave to pressure that they result from. Like for instance having forced Gender Gender diversity in areas where it shouldn't be. Or they don't like a certain something from a TV show so they complain about it on Twitter and then all of a sudden the TV show gets ruined for everyone else. Or here's my personal favorite fact and while this isn't really a tribute adjust to Millennials there's certainly a big part of it. The blatant disregard of history and the wanting to basically whitewash and bleach over certain aspects of history. For instance groups of individuals getting angry because of war memorial is in the shape of a cross despite the fact that it probably has nothing to do with Christianity or Catholicism. Or the simple fact that they are removing statues of individuals like Robert E Lee down in the South because they have completely forgotten that they are not statues commemorating the Confederacy. They are statues commemorating one of the best American generals the United States was ever able to produce until probably the first World War.

"we're talking about the same thing in my class.. We are planning on putting ours in shadow boxes (we will have 4) on the wall and then 3-wiring them together via serial comms. We intend to send an ack, and then an 8 bit number, that number is then added to the other device. We're hoping to do 3 of them in a bus topology.

Going further, we send an ack and a device ID over 8 bits.. 1010 0100 (first 4 are a sequence to initialize the ack, second 4 are device ID, up to 16 devices); this hits the bus.. the units are listening on this bus for serial data.. They are searching for a 1010 on the selected baud rate.. Once they get that, they store the next 4.. they compare that against their stored device ID value on the eeprom.. If it matches, it responds with the same 8 bit ack, which the primary node is waiting for. From there, we send our 8 bit number from primary to the secondary unit... That unit then repeats that 8 bit number. The original unit sends 1 last ack on whether it's right or not. Lastly, it sends a success notification, which closes the session. The bit gets stored on the secondary device, and the bit is removed from memory on the primary device. From there, we can do whatever we want with it.

We're going to have to logic out how we are treating data after the ack on devices not on the bus.. We don't want to erroneously send data to the wrong unit.

This is going to rely on the ALU having some kind of comparator function, which we aren't yet far along enough to know for sure if we'll have that by the end.. So the networking project is kind of being left open."

It's not their responsibility to adjust how they identify themselves for these reasons.

Moreover, there's a pretty strong argument that using the term ""lesbian"" to only identify as 100 percent homosexual won't stop any of the problems that you're talking about here."

"This is the part people don't seem to think through very often. Carbon tax systems like this literally use capitalism against itself. Sure, you can just buy the extra carbon credits and pass the price on to your consumers - but maybe your competitors haven't been dragging their knuckles on this issue and don't need to do that, so they're able to offer their product more cheaply. Now you're caught between a rock and a hard place.

And what's even better, for markets that have gotten into a carbon credit auction system (which I don't believe is a universal part of carbon taxing, but some states/provinces do it), the corporations are allowed to sell those excess credits to each other! You literally earn money by innovating to produce less carbon, and it costs you money not to!

Really, this whole system should be a libertarian's wet dream. But of course it ultimately means an inconvenience on the ultra-rich so any ""fiscal conservative"" will say it has to go."

"Exactly. Healthcare is a need, but unlike food it is unpredictable, like fire and rescue."
"https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success

The fact that reproducing women have outnumbered reproducing men by ~3-4:1 for virtually the entirety of human history(not even 'monkey' history) is not 'theoretical'.

It's genetic fact. It's testable, documented, proven. It's solid in biological data, it's solid in evolutionary justification(fewer males **can** meet the same reproductive capability, restricting reproduction to more genetically superior males is a species advantage), it is consistent across geographic groups; it's just plain ignorant to deny that it is the homo sapien M.O. when unchecked by modern social limitations. 

https://i.imgur.com/5oUx1hyh.jpg

If you're already having a negative emotional reaction to this post, understand that you're experiencing cognitive dissonance, and attempting to psychologically subvert a well-documented, simple fact that you don't *want* to believe.

*After* this point, you can be justifiably mad if you want, because the ""why"" of this information is much more murky than the ""if"". 

There are a couple places the thought train can go after it accepts that humans somehow cut 60-80% of males(at the least, assuming 100% of females reproduced) out of the gene pool for tens of thousands of years; mainly, the question of whether this fact of human history was socially orchestrated, via learned behavior and social conditioning, or biologically orchestrated, via instinctual and hormonally-sexed differences in neurology and behavior. 

Knowing that these genetic disparities are largely universal across various human populations, and knowing that all those human populations shared a biological evolutionary ancestor where such behavior and discrimination could have been biologically developed, it makes it a pretty hard sell that, for millenia upon millenia, a bunch of different human populations socially decided that only ~20% of men should get laid enough to reproduce. 

It's a much more feasible explanation that these behaviors are a biological condition of the human race. One that was socially overwritten by the massive community benefit of monogamy, or essentially, outcompeted by the economic power of societies that employ social rules which engage 100% of their population in reproduction *and economic output*, instead of societies that achieve a very-slightly superior genetic reproductive output, by excluding ~40% of the population from the social structure. 

It's not dangerous to acknowledge what humanity's base, unchecked behavior is. It's important, so that you can guard against it if need be "

"Yeah the Jeskai legends really leave a lot to be desired. My current Jeskai deck with Narset I expanded from mono-red chaos, and just gave it a creatureless gimmick so it felt fresh enough.  
  
I think the most difficult for me to build would be Mizzix... my Izzet deck has gone through so many iterations before I finally decided on which direction I wanted it to go in. Though now I'm working on another Izzet deck, but with artifacts!  
  
My most favourite would probably be a tie between Ghave and Animar. Ghave is one of my very firsts that I've been fine tuning for almost 7 years and it holds a special place in my heart. While Animar is just big stupid fun and really catches people off guard when they play it :).  
  
My least favourite is probably... Gisela? Honestly Boros doesn't have a lot of legends that were fun enough to build around in my opinion, or focus on combat stuff. The only reason I chose her was because I had planned to do all 3 coloured angels from Innistrad as decks.

"Great question. I'll share some ideas for answers.

Firstly, in practice humans have some ""above rational"" game theoretic tendency to cooperate and be altruistic, especially in games involving repeated interaction, public goods, and a possibility of reward and punishment. A lot of countries already do have a carbon tax/emissions trading (mostly similar system) in place. The major holdouts are just USA and Russia. 

Secondly, to the point of reward and punishment ‚Äì if diplomacy and moral arguments fall short, this is exactly a case where under WTO laws we can impose subsidies or sanctions and tariffs in a legal and principled way. 

Thirdly, on within-country level, carbon tax works with, not against, other solutions and needs. It incentivizes the growth of new technologies and related jobs and infrastructure. Not insignificantly, it can make the damn air less polluted in areas with factories, power plants and road traffic. 

The big picture is that we can't wait forever for a perfect solution. Some nonzero amount of carbon tax/emissions trading in EU+China+Canada+Australia+many countries ‚Äì and hopefully USA some time soon ‚Äì is much better than nothing, even if some players lag behind in implementation. "

"I hear you man. Its a tough choice, the only reason I've switched to Mafex (other than the improved quality) is the selection of characters which they went pretty deep with in their Nolanverse figures. 

Currently, SHF is owning that for IW but not with some issues (Iron Spidey, Cap, and DLC Iron man 50). I guess it just boils down to how much you like the character. 

Their version of Iron Spider and BP definitely nails it IMO but if you need counterpoints, I do find some joints on Mafex still a little fragile and their skin tones still needs improvement. 

You have until August to decide :)"
"Are you asking him questions with the intent of trying to work with/for him in the future or are you asking him questions just because you're interested in carpentry in general?  


I agree with /u/littleredhoodlum about asking all the questions. In my experience, it's best not to ask them if he's scowling, looks deep in thought or if he's trying to remember a measurement. If you want to learn, the best way to do so is by watching, asking questions, and actually doing the work. Have them walk/talk you through the process. Ask them about things beyond the work you're doing. If you're residing an older barn, it might have some pretty cool framing. See if he has any tools you're not familiar with and get a demo or at least ask what it's used for. If he does anything differently than the steward you normally work with, ask him about it. I'd say the bulk of carpenters are going to do many things the same way, but we all learn nifty little tips and tricks from each other all the time.   


Ask him what he likes about his work, what he doesn't like about it. Ask him if he specializes is certain aspects of carpentry or if he does it all.   


If you're seriously interested, my best advice is to try to find a company that does it all looking for seasonal/temp work. Get a little experience with everything without a huge commitment and then specialize if you want. Even if you specialize, you'll probably dabble in a bit of everything or will at least need a bit of knowledge about everything. It's amazing how much one thing affects the other in carpentry.   


If you have any specific questions, I can do my best to answer them. I've got about 20 years of carpentry experience behind me and my husband is do-it-all residential contractor. "

Our mutual friends felt that if he was interested in me, I was obliged to date him. It's taken me many years to articulate this - but you are not obliged to date anyone just because they're interested in you. 


The guy ended up groping and touching me and freaking me the hell out, and I am unsure whether it was sexual assault. It's been 10 years and I still haven't been able to wrap my head around it. 
I tried to make him lose interest in me, by hanging around other male friends more - but that just made him violent and he threatened to stab people. He had the knives and all, at a party.

Which is what most fans want as the end game. 

La Park made Super Friday's must watch wrestling for a month+ straight. Think the first trios match is a MOTYC and saw La Park burn down the house in the main event return.

"Hard team to play against for sure. I don't play Yuzu but I main the fuck out of Gord.

For Gord, just remember he doesn't great mixup/crossup capabilities. Hes got a lot of low moves so just block low and watch out 5C and JC. Another thing to keep in mind is that basically all of his moves are punishable as fuck. The infamous ""GRIM REAPER"" move is very punishable but it can some times have a good safety gap between Gord and the opponent, characters who have quick long reaching or sliding moves can easily negate that distance (Hakumen's 5B,  Gord's 2C, Orie's QCF C, Yu's 5B and slide move should all work. And lastly, if you block Gords 5BB and he either doesn't special cancel or reverse beat... easiest punish ever (I see a lot of Gord players throw out 5BB with no follow up and it's just so easy)

As for Yuzu. For me, watch out for those mix ups and that range. Her long ass sword swingy move can be hard to read so I really have to pay attention to startup animation, that helps me. Like Gord, she doesn't have the best mixup potential so that shouldn't be that bad to get around but you really got to look out for that crossup. That's how I always lose to Yuzo. Her and Izayoi will always fuck me up the first game but I usually get the hang of it in the second game.

Good luck!

The problem was that there were not a ton of kids that night and I was bored, so I started reading a book.

China is a hell hole, the USSR was a hell hole, the DPRK, Laos, Vietnam, all of these places are/were horrible; however, if you look at the 2nd Republic of Spain, you'll notice that because they were deeply rooted against fascism and totalitarianism as a whole, they were able to create an almost utopian society until they were squashed to death in a vice of both fascist and stalinist ideals."
"I had a brief stint as a kid that could maybe have been diagnosed as OCD, but I did outgrow it and never sought treatment.

It started out with me having a problem touching things; I had to touch things *just right* or I had to drop the item and grab it again. I'm not really sure what the ""rule"" for it was, but one example is that if I grabbed a pencil and my skin rubbed against it as I picked it up, I'd do it again. Or if my fingers weren't in the right spot. This was everything from pencils to cups to utensils to putting my hands on top of my blanket at night.

I'd also methodically examine the house before going to bed. Look in my closet and the living room closet (though not any one else's, for some reason). Under the bed, behind my desk, behind the couches, check the doors to be locked. Had to do it, every night.

Then I'd say ""good night"" to all the electronics in the house, all in the same order every night. Same with my stuffed animals. 

Kind of weird, non classical OCD stuff I guess. But it had the hallmarks. Glad I grew out of that."

""I wholeheartedly agree."" - Trump

""Acts or threats of political violence of any kind of have no place in the United States of America."" - Trump

Sure does look like he's encouraging, blatantly, acts or threats of political violence with his divisive rhetoric there.

That was sarcasm. I understand that there is some difficulty in comprehending sarcasm, levity, and facetiousness with some people here, so, let me be very clear that the previous statement was sarcasm.

You want him to take the blame because you do not like him. Your entire argument rests solely on conjecture. The idea that Trump intentionally chose his words to trigger a lunatic to act with violence and threats, or unintentionally triggered a lunatic to act, is completely unfounded, laughable, and drives a partisan bias. Politics is a mud fight. Someone threw a rock, and Trump said, ""Hey, no rocks."" and you want to blame him for the rock in the first place.

Hey, you know what, it's Hillary's fault that a man had his head busted by a bike lock in 2017. It's Bernie's fault that the baseball game got shot up.

"The people playing WoW have been tricked into thinking that in order to make something better you simply make the rewards better. Blizzard has deployed this technique on their customers for over a decade now.

It's an extremely lazy way to ""fix"" something.

Make open world PvP fun and it'll draw both factions to it. They also need to use marketing tricks to convince Alliance players to turn Warmode back on somehow (after they make it fun again).

The thing is, in order to make open world PvP fun they have to actually repair the core of the game. As it stands now it's totally broken. Scaling is broken. Gearing is broken. Class balance is broken. Core mechanics such as the GCD were obliterated just before launch. You see, they changed too much all at once, and as a result the game feels like a steaming pile of you know what.

If the game isn't first, fun, then nothing else matters. World PvP just isn't fun at the moment for many reasons, and no amount of ""reward incentives"" is going to fix that."

"Did you go into her office and just ask the question or did you first ask her if she had time to talk? If you didn't do the latter, do that. Another approach would be to email questions or email her with a request for 5 minutes. If she asks why you're emailing her requests for her time, calmly explain that she seemed very busy the last time you spoke with her and that you didn't want to interrupt or waste her time."

"Here's what it said:

&gt; Every fan down in Smashville liked hype a lot‚Ä¶

&gt;But the Grinch, who lived somewhere in France, DID NOT!

&gt;The Grinch hated hype-ing! The whole pre-release season!

&gt;Now please don‚Äôt ask why. No one quite knows the reason.

‚Äã

&gt; It could be he was sick of all the fake leaks.

&gt;It could be, perhaps, he could not wait 6 weeks.

&gt;But I think that the most likely reason of all,

&gt;Was he knew Verg‚Äôs roster was two sizes too small.

‚Äã

&gt;Whatever the reason, the size or the wait,

&gt;He stood there on Wednesday, ready for hate.

&gt;Staring down at the banner with a sour, Grinchy frown,

&gt;At unreleased characters ‚Äì shit‚Äôs about to go down.

‚Äã

&gt;For he knew every fan down in Smashville online,

&gt;Were caught in a drought, just passing the time.

&gt;‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôre talking about Skull Kid!‚Äù He snarled with a sneer,

&gt;‚ÄúNext month is Ultimate! It‚Äôs practically here!‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously humming,

&gt;‚ÄúI must tell them somehow, they won‚Äôt see it coming!‚Äù

&gt;For each day he knew all the smash boys and smash girls,

&gt;Would cling to new leaks, it might make him hurl.

‚Äã

&gt;And then! Oh, the posts! Oh, the posts!

&gt;Posts! Posts! Posts!

&gt;That‚Äôs one thing he hated! The posts!

&gt;POSTS! POSTS! POSTS!

‚Äã

&gt;Then the fans young and old would talk and they‚Äôd guess.

&gt;And they‚Äôd guess! And they‚Äôd guess! And they‚Äôd GUESS!

&gt;GUESS! GUESS! GUESS!

‚Äã

&gt;They would guess there‚Äôd be Waddle Dee, and Minecraft‚Äôs own Steve.

&gt;Which was something the Grinch couldn‚Äôt stand to conceive.

&gt;And then they‚Äôd do something he liked least of all!

&gt;Every fan down in Smashville, the tall and the small,

‚Äã

&gt;Would all come together, like fish on a string.

&gt;Having taken the bait, oh to the threads they would cling!

&gt;His phone would ding! It would ding! It would Ding!

&gt;DING! DING! DING!

‚Äã

&gt;And the more the Grinch listened to his phone go ring ding,

&gt;The more the Grinch thought, ‚ÄúI must stop this whole thing!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúWhy, for 231 days I‚Äôve put up with it now!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúI must stop these fake leaks from coming! But how?‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;Then he got an idea! An awful idea!

&gt;THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFULLY AWFUL IDEA!

&gt;‚ÄúI know just what to do!‚Äù The Grinch laughed in his throat.

&gt;And he broke out his laptop and started to gloat.

‚Äã

&gt;And he chuckled, and clucked, ‚ÄúWhat a great Grinchy trick!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúWith this promo poster I have, they‚Äôll know it‚Äôs legit!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúAll I need is a platform‚Ä¶‚Äù The grinch searched around.

&gt;But since the fanbase is large, no new ones were found.

‚Äã

&gt;Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply yelled,

&gt;‚ÄúIf they can post on 4 chan, I‚Äôll make one myself!‚Äù

&gt;So he took out a pan and took up a pad,

&gt;He wrote, and he wrote, the fans won‚Äôt be had!

‚Äã

&gt;Then he added some cuses and some deconfirms too,

&gt;‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no new playable Pokemon, oh no, boo hoo.‚Äù

&gt;Then the Grinch yelled ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs done!‚Äù and so he clicked,

&gt;It was posted online, but soon he was ticked.

‚Äã

&gt;The board remained dark. Quiet posts filled the air.

&gt;All the fans disregarded his post without care.

&gt;He read the replies, of which their were few,

&gt;‚ÄúThis leak is fake! This guy has no clue!‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;He stared at the screen, clenching his fist.

&gt;Translating from French to English was hardly a synch.

&gt;He needed hard evidence, that much was clear.

&gt;But a photo? Too easily faked was his fear.

‚Äã

&gt;He thought and he thunk, about what he should do.

&gt;A video might cost him his job, that much was true.

&gt;‚ÄúThese characters,‚Äù he grinned, ‚Äúthe public must know!‚Äù

&gt;He knew it was time to put on a show.

‚Äã

&gt;He looked round the room, to make sure none could hear,

&gt;And he took out his phone, with much newfound cheer.

&gt;‚ÄúAnd now!‚Äù grinned the Grinch ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put them in a slum!‚Äù

&gt;He took out his phone, then took out his thumb.

‚Äã

&gt;He was swiping through apps, to decide what to use,

&gt;When he heard a loud sound, like the honk of a goose.

&gt;He turned around fast, and he saw the night-watchman,

&gt;It was Jack, oh how he hated this Scotsman.

‚Äã

&gt;The Grinch had been caught by this large man of honor,

&gt;Who‚Äôd seen the light left on, but the Grinch was no goner.

&gt;He started at the Grinch and barked, ‚ÄúOh Eric, why,‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúWhy are you taking pics of this banner? WHY?‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;But you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,

&gt;He thought up a lie and he thought it up quick!

&gt;‚ÄúWhy my sweet old friend Jack,‚Äù the Grinchy Eric lied,

&gt;‚ÄúThere was a rip in this banner messing it up on one side!‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;‚ÄúSo I was asked to stay late and fix it, my dear.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm texting the boss about the new one right here.‚Äù

&gt;And his fib fooled the watchman. Then the Grinch shook his head,

&gt;‚ÄúYou‚Äôre keeping me from my work,‚Äù he said.

‚Äã

&gt;And when Jack the Scotsman went away in a huff,

&gt;The Grinch took out his phone and loaded it up!

&gt;He lined up the evidence onto a desk,

&gt;Opened up snapchat, and thought of something grotesque.

‚Äã

&gt;He started recording the leak right there with his phone,

&gt;Writing ‚Äúfuck you Nintendo lolllll‚Äù now all would be known!

&gt;He sent it along waiting for a response,

&gt;Someone screen-grabbed his snap with no nonchalance.

‚Äã

&gt;It was a quarter past midnight, some fans still in beds,

&gt;With dreams of Shantae and Elma in heads.

&gt;The Grinch he just sat, he sat, and waited.

&gt;Happy with the silence he had soon created.

‚Äã

&gt;Safe and anonymous, thanks to snapchat,

&gt;He‚Äôd surely put an end to speculation chitchat.

&gt;‚ÄúPoohPooh to the fans!‚Äù he was Grinchishly humming.

&gt;‚ÄúThey‚Äôre finding out now no more surprises are coming!‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just waking up! I know what they‚Äôll do!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúTheir mouths will hang open a minute or two,

&gt;Then the fans down in Smashville will all cry boohoo!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a noise,‚Äù Grinned the Grinch, ‚ÄúThat I simply MUST hear!‚Äù

&gt;So he paused. And the Grinch refreshed pages with cheer.

‚Äã

&gt;And he did read some words, flooding into the site.

&gt;It started out light, then his eyes widened in fright.

&gt;The words aren‚Äôt sad! Why, they sounded merry!

&gt;It couldn‚Äôt be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!

‚Äã

&gt;He stared down at Smashville and the Grinch popped his eyes!

&gt;To his core he shook, what he read was a shocking surprise!

&gt;Every fan down in Smashville, both casual and hardcore,

&gt;Were cheering and cheering! With no surprises in store!

‚Äã

&gt;He hadn‚Äôt stopped leaks from coming, they came!

&gt;What‚Äôs worse, he found out, they'd discovered his name!

&gt;And the Grinch, with his grinch-ears ringing with dinging,

&gt;Stood puzzling, and puzzling, ‚ÄúTo what are they clinging?‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;‚ÄúIt came without Directs! Without trailer posts!

&gt;It came without Sakurai, Reggi, or treehouse live hosts!‚Äù

&gt;And he puzzled and puzzled, till his puzzler was sore.

&gt;Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn‚Äôt before!

‚Äã

&gt;‚ÄúMaybe hyping‚Äù he thought, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt come from fake leaks.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúMaybe hyping‚Ä¶ perhaps‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt something so meek!‚Äù

&gt;And what happened then? Well in Smashville they say,

&gt;Smash Ultimate‚Äôs roster grew three sizes that day.

‚Äã

&gt;And the minute that Sakurai got word of the leak,

&gt;The cheers of his fans kept it from ruining his week.

&gt;The leaks they had come, but it hadn‚Äôt mattered.

&gt;The people were happy, and their hopes were untattered.

‚Äã

&gt;The trailers now could confirm restored hopes and new hype,

&gt;Hype that would keep ringing and dinging each night.Ôªø

"""In the speech to which you refer, President Trump did something, which in my view should be and I believe will be in the future considered to be historic in significance. For the first time, at least in my memory, a major world leader stood up, squared his shoulders, looked the nations of the world in the eye, and stated the simple and fundamental truth that mankind was designed by [HaShem](http://www.aish.com/jl/p/g/48942416.html?s=mpw), the Creator, by G-d to be divided into individual nation states, and it was not designed and it will not flourish if it is formed into some kind of conglomerate of nations, into huge blocks of nations, or even to some kind of one-world government system ‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHaShem chooses certain messengers throughout history to raise certain ideas, to disseminate certain concepts throughout the world. **HaShem has placed these words into the mouth of the president of the United States**. And He has put on notice all the world that He does not accept, does not believe in the validity, the truth, or the desirability of the internationalist super state, globalization, one world government approach to humanity. He believes in the ancient and Divinely Ordained system of sovereign nation states who develop according to their abilities and traditions, and each therefore finds its correct and proper place in the forward march of humanity.‚Äù  Rabbi David Bar-Hayim

"Let me tell you a story because i went through the same exact thing. My girlfriend in high school cheated on me during my sophomore year of college. I found her and her new lover in her car laying down together one day and that sent me through a dark and depressing path for a year and a half. It completely broke my trust, my confidence, and my soul (as cheesy as that sounds). I spent my days doing nothing, ignoring all my schoolwork, having episodes at work and barely showing up, my life was slowly declining because of this girl and her careless/ heartless act to betray someone who loved her very much and gave her their all. The pressure became too much and I had to take a gap year off from school much to my family's dismay and quit my job because the mental strain was just too much. One day, I decided that my life needs to change and I need something to distract myself from her and this breakup. I signed up for jiu jitsu, started going to more and more events like music festivals, parties, school events, etc. I even changed my habits like waking up early, exercising more, and i wouldn't condone it, but smoking weed helps especially with friends. Basically what I'm saying to you brother is it's always going to hurt and I know you're mad and you want her to miss you and want you back, but the brutal truth is, they won't because if they wanted you back then they would've done it already. Live your life bro! it doesn't always have to involve a significant other all the time. To live a life not loving yourself is pointless because if you can't find happiness in yourself then how can you find it in someone else? Try new things brother I promise it gets better. Be strong, love yourself. "

It was a bad choice for Sienna's before the melee buff and remains that way after.

Repeater Pistol is still good on nerfed BH, the stipulation being you *have* to shoot for that power versus + hunter trait. The burst fire does great damage on bosses/specials. Full disclosure, I had to be told this, I used to think the Repeater was just a weaker variant of the BoP.

Speaking of the BoP. They're fun, but they are lacking pretty hard. With the anti-ranged meta happening in the beta, I'd rather see their damage doubled and their ammo halved, something like 16 or less for Zealot/WHC without ammo trait and 20 for BH/WHC with ammo trait. That might put them below the handgun but give them enough oomph and damage to make them an option for Salties bored with their crossbows. Basically, give the pistol the kick that the run n' gun players want, but not enough ammo that they wipe the level with it."

"Giving children a savings account at birth seems like a good idea to reduce dis-saving, but like Prospo said this seems pretty badly-designed. Why not just give it all in a lump-sum so you've got more time to earn interest on it? Why not make it an index fund so you earn more interest? Why make it geared towards home ownership, which, like the mortgage-interest deduction, will just raise the price of houses? Hell even with education this is a very disputed idea -- 40% of Pell grant spending just goes to higher tuition costs.

I really like the idea of government-sponsored funds for, say, continued education -- lifelong learning will become increasingly crucial -- but I'm not sure how receiving $37,000 from the government by your eighteenth birthday is really going to help anyone, unless this turns into a generational program. You can't pay for college on that amount, buy a home on that amount, or cover yourself for healthcare with it. I suppose it could start your savings or cover some short-term expenses, but it doesn't seem like something that would really radically transform poverty. 

Taking advantage of market growth in welfare is a fine concept, but in this end the phaseout on this just winds up raising the marginal tax rate on the poor with relatively little benefit. If anything, you're just reducing the incentive to work and keeping more people in poverty.

evolve the one that gives you the highest CP.  
CP and movesets are the kings of gym combat.    
IV's mean very little once you step into the arena.   
however, they make all the difference in how strong a pokemon you will get at each of its power levels.
  
Here's some optional reading material about what IV's mean in the real world.  
  
a level 24 squirtle (max level given your trainer level) has a CP range of 417 (IV=0/0/0) to 554 (IV=15/15/15).  if your 450CP squirtle is level 24, it's IV's are in the lower percentile range.  if the 'mon is lower than 24, then it's 450 will be higher in the range and therefore a higher IV%.  a level 19.5 squirtle is 338 to 450, and your 450CP would have perfect IV's, if it was level 19.5.  make sense? personally i'd wait for a stronger one, unless squirtles are very hard to come by in your area.  
level 24 bulbasaur CP range is 520 to 673.  if your 506CP Bulbasaur is level 24, then it's IV's would be pretty crappy.  if it has perfect IV's it would be level 20 (433-506).  
have a look at this chart i threw together.  http://imgur.com/XoFOTLE  
basically, the further left you are on green line, the lower your pokemon level is, but the higher your IV%, for a given CP.  which is better because as your pokemon powers up, it will stay in that vertical position relative between Min and Max for a given level, for every level that it increases to.  hope this makes sense.  
personally i try and cultivate the highest CP i can get out a 'mon when evolving, because the moveset you get assigned is a total crap-shoot.  if getting the candies is not easy for a particular 'mon then i'd try and catch/hatch something as strong as possible, so if i can only get one evolution, it will be as strong a CP as possible, so even if it has a crappy moveset, it still might be usable in combat.  however based on the chart, the higher IV is more desirable, but not a requisite.

"Zanthe ""Scrub"" Pappathanassiou  
DOB: 5/03/3001  
POB: Thermopolis, Free Worlds League  

Background: Zanthe was the scion of a minor noble family, although she resented familial expectations, the required education and endless attempts to marry her off. The only thing she really took to was training, through which she was progressing pretty well. Then, she met a like-minded peer, instantly forming a bond. The two eloped, then stole their training mechs and hopped on the first dropship to Galatea, establishing a brand-new mercenary group composed of a small group of various misfits.

Their first contract ended badly, with her partner being killed when his Thunderbolt's ammo exploded. Zanthe's Commando didn't do too well, either, getting cored out by a hovercraft swarm. The company broke up shortly after the end of the contract. Too proud to admit she screwed up (and not wanting to face the years of family guilt trips and lectures), Zanthe now joins the ranks of the dispossessed, trolling the merc bars and Galatea's planetary network, looking to get back into the action.

She brings with her a hulled-out Commando in a warehouse, good only for spare parts, and some bitterly-earned experience.

[This is an alternate timeline from a merc unit I'm actually running via MekHQ - the company didn't dissolve after the first contract and Zanthe upgraded to a Vulcan, then a Warhammer (preferring the 6D variant)]"

In addition, minerals can build up around the edge, which can damage roots.

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

Without getting to into it, my best friend of 7 years (both 24F) and I had a falling out. I feel the situation is severe enough that our friendship will not be repaired unless she makes a large effort to be a better friend.I find this very unlikely.

She has had a cat (let‚Äôs call him Gus) for the last four years. For two years he lived with her, and then she decided she wanted to get a different cat that she could show in cat shows. She didn‚Äôt want to have two cats at once because she lived in college houses and it was tight so she had her mom take care of Gus.

Her mom has been taking care of Gus for 2 years now. During this time (about 8 months ago?) My friend were talking and I was saying how once I moved out on my own I really wanted a cat, and she offered me to take Gus. I agreed because I really care about that cat and thought it would be awesome to get a cat I know I like. 

Now I am moving into my new place next week. Our falling out just occurred last week. I told her I do not think it will be best for me to take Gus yesterday. She told me I‚Äôm incredibly selfish and that her mom has been holding onto him just for me all this time and not looking for other families to take him because I said I would be taking him. I am mildly skeptical because her mom had him for 2 years, but she could be telling the truth and couldn‚Äôt find anyone before me.

I said I would take the cat, and I know I have a responsibility. But goddam she treats me like utter garbage. I‚Äôve never had a cat, and I‚Äôm going through a stressful/hard time in life right now for a lot of personal reasons. I just want there to be nothing but pure happiness associated with my cat, and I don‚Äôt want to be reminded of her whenever I look at Gus. More (super selfish reasons) are that Gus is 12 and he is 14 pounds and hasn‚Äôt been getting any vet care.

Now reasons I am being a huge ass. I agreed to take him KNOWING he is 12 and 14 pounds, and didn‚Äôt have vet care. I also will be leaving her mother out to dry to find him a family. Also her mom shows dogs and literally has 7 or 8, so poor Gus is locked up alone in a room all day with no social contact. Whenever I visit they always talk about how happy he will be when I take him because he seriously needs some love. Also I‚Äôm concerned about his health as they are severely over feeding him (they joke it‚Äôs because they feel bad for him because he‚Äôs alone all day so they feed him extra...) And he is a really good cat and I care about him. 

One last thing, her mom has tons of connections in the animals world through showing dogs/cats and I highly doubt Gus will be given up to a humane society. I‚Äôm sure her mom would find him a loving home, I‚Äôm just screwing her over. But I didn‚Äôt know that she would have planned to get rid of him anyway even if I didn‚Äôt want him.... 

Anyway, thank you to anyone who reads this. I went to the humane society and met some amazing kittens and i am so torn right now. Ive always bent over backwards for this girl without a second thought, and a big part of mine just wants to say screw if and be a selfish jerk and get a new kitten of my own. But I also genuinely want to be a good person. After what she did to me my whole family hates her so they aren‚Äôt any help for advice on this matter (all I get it ‚Äújust forget her and do what is best for you!‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not just about her, it‚Äôs about her mom and the cat and being a good person!) 

Thanks!

"Sorry, but it's a bit difficult to see what you are trying to show on that drawing.

Some hints though: the low pass filter does indeed reject all higher frequencies - but the spectrum represented by complex samples runs from -fs/2 to fs/2, with fs being the sampling rate. A low pass filter is actually symmetric around 0Hz, so it removes both the frequencies that are higher than the cutoff, and those that are lower than the negative value of the cutoff.

The goal of the shifter is to make one of the stations end up at zero Hz. This way, the low pass filter can remove the other stations. Another important thing is that, once the higher frequencies have been removed in the low pass filter, one  can then represent the remaining data with a lower sampling rate. The 'decimation' is the factor that your sampling rate is reduced by. This makes the next less demanding computationally.

The 'demodulation' is the WBFM block (which turns an FM modulated signal into the digitized audio), the last block isn't the demodulator but the driver for your sound card, where the samples are being made audible. 

Note that the various sampling rates in the flow-chart seem a bit randomly chosen. The 20MHz at the left means that it shows all of the FM band, which is reasonable. The low pass filter does decimation by 100, so you are left with a 200kHz sampling rate. But then, in the 'Rational Resampler', this is turned into a 480kS/s to feed the WBFM block. This itself does decimation by 10 to end up with 48kHz audio, which is just what your soundcard wants. But it would have been more efficient to keep the WBFM block at 200kS/s, and to do the sampling rate conversion after the FM demodulation."

"&gt;NSAIDS can insrease risk of heart attack and stroke

Very, very, very rarely. Much more rarely than epidurals stall labor, leading to fetal distress and c-sections. I know plenty of women who have had negative results from epidurals. I don't know anyone who has had a stroke after taking ibuprofen. 

Again, it is a personal decision to choose which risks you can live with and which you'd rather go without. They are two totally different sets of risks, and one set happens to take place during an already potentially dangerous medical event. 

I personally don't like the idea of taking narcotics at all. But I don't think it's at all contradictory for a woman to be okay with them and not okay with an epidural. Two different kinds of things, two different sets of risks, during two different antenatal phases. 

I don't call people who DO get an epidural uneducated or irrational. It's about respecting women's choices, which happens to go both ways, and which you seem to struggle with. "

Certainly cheaper than staying at a hotel. 

My dad has a sailing license (so do I now) so we don't need a Skipper. You have your own kitchen so you're doing your own cooking, and usually buying in bulk because you're not going to be able to buy groceries every day, so you're saving a lot on food compared to your typical vacation. 

As vacations go, sailing is actually not that expensive. If you can afford to stay at a hotel somewhere, it's probably cheaper to be on a sailboat."

Hot air rises and cold air sinks so in most homes lower levels are always colder then upper ones. You can try balancing your hvac system, there should be adjustable dampers. In the winter you want to slightly close the vents to the upper levels and keep the lower ones open. Reverse in the summer. 

However, in my experience this works well in the summer, but not as well in the winter. 

As for the crawl space, that is always going to be cold since there are no hvac vents in there. Better insulation will not really help a little as there is no source of new heat in the space. "

The song itself is pretty good, but honestly the weird cheerful high pitched interjections from one of the girls is kind of distracting. That part really breaks my enjoyment of the song. If that part had been edited out, I wouldn't mind.

Other than that, I think it's a pretty good debut! Their main vocalist seems pretty strong, especially with those high notes she holds during the song. Their concept is really interesting and different too, so I'm looking forward to their future!"

Nancy's Nook is a good resource for excision surgeons. We also have a Successful Doctors map on the right sidebar at r/endo that lists endo specialists and also excision docs (marked with hearts). If you check my post history I also have a recent post listing every OTC and easy to get Rx med that has helped me with endo pain/symptoms. Toradol has been a godsend for me, it's an Rx NSAID that works better than narcotics (rather than distracting from pain it just stops the pain). It might be a good stop gap until you can get in with a better doctor.

I really hope you get some relief soon and find at least one doctor that will take your pain seriously. Best of luck!!"

But if you never get to socialize then i guess that part of your brain just starts to shut down. All this technology isn't helping either its just really hard to find meaningful conversation anymore

A lot of the ""perks"" that some companies have copied from Facebook etc are the ones that specifically are designed to keep you at work longer, by providing locality for services/things you typically have to travel for.  Normally have to go for a 10 minute walk for to a coffee shop for a drink, or lunch?  They give you that shit on-site.  Your normal gym is a 20 minute drive?

"Maybe not better pets than dogs seeing as how they aren't domesticated. Plus, when you let people think an animal *could* be a pet, that usually means they'll take one from the wild and make it live in their home (instead of a safe reserve designed for the animal ran by professionals). This is a bad idea due to a number of things like raccoons commonly having rabies, people's tendency to treat every creature like a dog, raccoons' being nocturnal when humans are not, etc. 

HOWEVER, raccoons are *very* used to humans, similar to crows, pigeons, and other animals common in human spaces. Thus they tend to greatly underreact to people and show little to no fear towards them. In addition, they are just intelligent animals in general. Apparently they do quite well on memory tests and stuff like that. 

But just because they're smart doesn't mean they make for good pets. There are many pet animals that are pretty dumb too but can live with people much more safely than others. I'm sure there are some cases of someone keeping a raccoon and it being very healthy and safe, but in general when people want pets they just buy them or kidnap them and stick them in their house and end up causing a lot of stress on the animal. Even common pet birds, reptiles, fish, etc. really aren't given the kind of care they truly need. Cats and dogs make such great pets because they evolved *with* us as humans developed society to the point where they are essentially speciated from their ancestors into the highly domesticated animals we know today (dogs more so than cats but that's a different topic).

Sorry for the long response, it's just a very fascinating topic and I wanted to put the breaks on raccoons being pets before anyone gets any ideas. 

TLDR raccoons are very smart and used to humans but don't have them as pets unless you're a professional animal keeper."

"The earliest it is possible to ovulate is CD8 - it takes at least that long to select and mature a follicle. HOWEVER, that only applies to true periods where you had confirmed ovulation (this is why in FAM for birth control, the first three days of a cycle are only safe if you confirmed ovulation through temping the cycle before). Since your last cycle was anovulatory, technically your period was breakthrough bleeding, and so it was possible to ovulate at any point."

At the same time there are people involved with friend groups who are ""there"" but I wouldn't consider them friends, just friendly acquaintances.

"&gt;9 and 10 with Rose for the relationship and the teamwork

I'd actually argue Nine and Rose had plenty of conflict as a duo. They disagreed on a lot of things throughout Series 1, which usually led to them questioning what they believed in and growing as people. Examples include:

* Rose dealing with her own mortality and the Doctor's cold alien mindset in ""The End Of The World"".
* The Doctor and Rose arguing over whether they should let the Gelth possess the corpses of dead humans and enlist Gwenyth for her help in ""The Unquiet Dead"".
* The Doctor compromising his own principles and betraying who he is to try to wipe out the Dalek in ""Dalek"".
* Rose almost bringing about the end of the world in ""Father's Day"".
* Whether or not they should trust Captain Jack in ""The Empty Child"".
* The Doctor trying to send Rose away from the Dalek fight against her wishes in ""The Parting Of The Ways"".

The exact point the Doctor and Rose's relationship started to lose me was when the writing started to focus on how in love they were in every episode, and they started to fall in lockstep about everything in Series 2 (save for Rose getting jealous of Sarah Jane in ""School Reunion"")."

"The paradigm behind MonoBehaviours is to essentially code a single behaviour, and attach it to an object. The problem with this is that each behaviour has to include the data associated with it, which couples the data layer to the logic layer, which is generally a big no-no. 

It makes communication between different objects an absolute nightmare because each object is generic (can have any set of MonoBehaviours on it). For instance, if you wanted to code a collision interaction between two objects, you generally have to check what type of object you're looking at before you actually run any code on it. This is a job that's usually handled by the compiler at run-time, but since Monobehaviour isn't OOP, it can't.

ECS (Entity-Component-System) has a better paradigm: Attach *data* to each game object (ie. a game object contains many ""Components"" and ""Entities"" are made up of a set of components) and run a ""system"" that iterates over all known entities and runs a single behaviour. This makes data completely decoupled from logic and allows you to see collections of similar objects at once. To revisit the collision example, there are now many ways of checking for collisions: raycasting still works (it was a decent but incomplete solution in MB, it's far better in ECS), but you can now also, say, check the positions of all relevant entities at once and check that they're close together. Or, ask for two different types of entities in a single system and check position/other data like that.

Moving from Monobehaviour to ECS is kind of like moving from a first-person perspective to a top-down perspective. Monobehaviours only give you a good look at what data you are holding and it's hard to see what everyone else is holding. ECS lets you see what everybody is holding at once."

Unlike most people, I've actually helped out at a Men's ""shelter"" (Rescue Mission)... and in addition to that, I've ""taken in"" (to my own home) and attempted to help (sometimes successfully, other times not so successfully) quite a few different men who would otherwise have been (and some who nevertheless, then subsequently *chose* to become ) ""homeless.""

In the vast majority of such cases\*... they create their OWN problems (most commonly drugs &amp; alcohol).
-
**They also frequently reject or abuse/waste what help IS offered (family, friends, coworkers, etc) to them *PRIOR* to actually becoming homeless**, and generally REALLY have to hit ""rock bottom"" before they are willing to give UP their addiction &amp; defiance.

-
Also, most of the ones who DO... typically only STAY ""homeless"" for a brief period of time: 3 months, 6 months, etc.  The REALITY of it teaches them a firm lesson, and they seek help (they nearly ALL have someone they COULD and CAN still turn to for a ""hand up"" -- it's just that *they normally don't want to take it* for various reasons: pride/shame, addictions/unwillingness to give them up, and/or the fact that the ""hand"" also requires THEM to ""man up"" and put in at least SOME effort &amp; work to pull themselves back onto their OWN feet... and frankly, many men just *prefer* to wallow in a ""self pity party"" for a while).

-
Is that DIFFERENT than women? Yes, in nearly all regards. Women you see not only GET more ""assistance"" -- they also generally have ZERO problem **being ""parasites""** on others; even DEMANDING to be able to live **parasitically** on others -- if you open your eyes you'll see that ALL AROUND YOU (not merely in regard to ""shelters"" but in everything else as well); that kind of ""entitlement"" is ingrained &amp; embedded in the female psyche (and probably genetics/biology) -- whereas the opposite is true of men (for better AND worse\*\*).

---
\* We're talking the ones who DO end up ""homeless"" and sleeping under some bridge, in some culvert, etc.  The ones who DON'T *reject or abuse/waste* the help but instead take PROPER advantage of it to get back on their feet... well they DON'T become ""homeless.""

\*\* Any man (male) who DOESN'T have some level -- initial anyway -- degree of ""pride"" that prevents him from **willingly becoming a ""parasite""**... isn't actually a MAN, and likely never will be."

"I work for a large department store chain, but my store is small (most are 2 stories, mine is one) Because of this we have A) very few employees at any one time, especially weekdays and B) only two checkouts, on on either side of the store at the main entrances. So, with that set up -- things my coworkers do to make things more stressful: not know what they're supposed to be doing when on the floor. We have two main job descriptions if you're not support staff (the people who stock the merchandise) or a manager. You either work behind the register as a cashier or you fold clothes, clean the fitting room, and handle customer questions on the floor as ""recovery"". Most recovery people are slow to actually clean or they are useless for everything and I still have to do my job as cashier AND do their job so my manager doesn't get angry at &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; for having a messy register. (Recovery won't get in trouble if they say ""well Kisses didn't tell me she needed the registers cleaned off!"" total bullshit.) They'll also try to get out of doing their work if more than one person comes up to the register at one time. They'll swoop in and ""help"" the other customer instead of cleaning even though they aren't supposed to help unless I call for them and so I'll get into trouble AGAIN for calling on my recovery staff needlessly even though &lt;i&gt;I didn't ask them for help&lt;/i&gt;.
And then there are the customers. Most customers are fine and don't impact my day one way or the other. Ones that do usually fall into one of three categories: the Complainer, the Price Checker, and the Coupon Hound. The Complainer is never satisfied with anything from the amount of service on the floor (""no, we can't just call more people in, that's not how this works"") to the number of cash-outs in the store (""yes, we used to have a third register in the back, yes it's a pain that they removed it. No, you complaining to management won't spontaneously make it reappear."") to the fact that we play music in our stores. Having to grit my teeth and bear it as these customers just &lt;i&gt;bitch&lt;/i&gt; is the worst part of my day. Price Checkers usually have me running back and forth across the store checking signs and prices and yelling at me when something comes up ""wrong"". My computer is right ~98% of the time. The other 2% usually isn't my computer's fault -- it's my signing team -- but I can't tell the customer that because ""Well the SIGN SAYS-!"" and that's not even getting into the people who I'm sure change the signs to read the price they WANT to pay and not what the sale IS, but I have no way to prove that. And then the Coupon Hound is the one who comes in with a pile of coupons and dumps them on my counter saying ""tell me what I can use today"". Fuck if I know, lady. Read the damn things yourself. But, no, I smile and dig through these crumpled old coupons and paper print outs only to find that all of them are either expired or don't apply. Cue the screaming and swearing and complaining. Of &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt; it's my fault your coupons don't work. And of &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt; I'll call a manager over who will tell you the exact same thing I did first only to bend and say I should use one of your expired coupons because they want people like you coming back to spend money at our store.

My LL partner has gained weight and says that is one thing she does not feel pretty enough to have sex with. I have done nothing to make her think this. And frankly I don't think it is a problem. She has gained some weight but really I don't care.

"1) Fuck the Red Sox.  
2) I'm OK with Cutch.  I don't love him but I definitely don't hate him. He's like a 7/10 area for me.  If Cash goes another direction, I don't think I'll harbor any animosity unless that name includes the words ""Shane"" and ""Robinson"".  We knew what we was, hoped we'd catch him on a hot streak but you can't justify the idea of taking a career AAAA player seriously unless he produces.  There was a chance, he did not and it's kind of sad he got as many starts as he did.  He didn't swing with his eyes closed like Chris Carter though.  Guy did his best and there's no shame in that - the shame is on our team for that being the best we could do in a pinch.  
3) Based on what we have seen as possibilities, Gray is going to the Giants in the MadBum trade.  
4) It's foggy at best.  I know Cash will get a good deal if this happens, and he'll make sure it includes Gray because the guy has value even if he didn't live up to expectations in NY.  I don't think the Giants will even try to downplay the value there.  Andujar reminds me of Pujols in a certain way, starting 3B and then realizing you don't have the glove for it, going to OF and then planting yourself at 1B because that bat is serious.  
4) I want the Japanese pitcher.  Even if it seems kind of weird, I think having Tanaka on the staff and getting to bring in a Japanese pitcher will make a world of difference.  Translation is translation, language is way better.  There is no substitute for somebody speaking to you in your native tongue.  I'm still disappointed about Ohtani because we could have made it work and I think he will end up being a gimick instead of what he could have been on another team with that Pujols contract sitting on their head and they won't afford Trout.  There's no dynasty building around a player who in his first few years is on an absolute HOF trajectory and that's pretty sad."

"Portia is a Snooty Villager! It's been over a month since I had one, so this was a lucky break for me.

As for the Zenlocke, I suspended the move-in/out rules temporarily to restore villager balance in my town. Before Portia, a villager named Rod moved in from the campsite, so I have 4 jocks in town. From that, the dialogue became way too repetitive, which messed up the enjoyment of the game quite a lot.

In other words, I'm selectively going to move Jocks out to fix this personality disbalance I'm having. But otherwise, I'm still playing by all other rules."

"In your history, you've said repeatedly that the relationship is abusive and he's been documenting your mental health issues in an attempt to prove you to be an unfit mother so that you will lose custody in a divorce, or so his parents will be able to get custody. You also say he's the one consistently pushing for counselling. It's not actually recommended that abuse victims go to counselling with their abusers, because not only are abusers good at manipulating even professionals, but they often take what they learn about their victims in counselling and use it to further abuse them. It makes you wonder why he's pushing so hard for counselling. His motivation there may not be to fix the marriage. He should go to counselling though. Alone. I'd make *that* the condition instead.

That said, in your history you also say your husband repeatedly crosses your boundaries, including sexually, and he reasons it with ""the world wouldn‚Äôt be fun if people stopped the first time they were told"". So I don't actually know why you think he'd follow any of your rules, even if you do threaten to call his probation/parole officer, because he clearly has trouble following rules and actually thinks it's fun if he hurts you in the process. If anything, you are probably *more* at risk than ever before because he won't want to go back to prison.

Please let his probation/parole officer find him somewhere else to live. It's part of their job. Please."

"[Darling of Loving Vows](https://vndb.org/v6618) is basically Okabe &amp; co. screwing around with no stakes and it more or less follows a SoL format. For example, in one of the routes Kurisu designs a Future Gadget that's a pair of bracelets worn by two people that shocks both if they fight or get too far away from each other, and can't be removed unless the two come to an agreement. In Moeka's route, the Future Gadget Lab forms a band. The context of where it fits in is that Okabe sends a bunch of D-mails to himself, among them being a D-mail telling him to focus on developing other Future Gadgets rather than focusing on the PhoneWave. The Delta worldline is one where neither WW3 nor a SERN dystopia occurs.

You can find a reasonable quality translation of it on Zakobot's youtube channel, but it is otherwise untranslated. If you liked the SoL stuff from the first couple chapters of Steins;Gate you'll like Darling.

As for Hyde of the Dark Dimension, I'd say yeah it's worth checking out. It fits in right at the end of Luka's chapter in the original - when Okabe sends the mail that's meant to undo Luka's D-mail, Okabe finds himself sent to the Gamma worldline. [In it, Okabe is a Rounder and is Moeka's partner.](/spoiler) It's worthy of note because many people, including myself, consider it to be the unofficial ""Moeka route"". Some fans created a TL of it in VN format, which you can find on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy_5EroxIrI).

If you are planning on voting in this election in Tennessee here are some things you should know.

This is a close race to keep the red state red.

Uber¬†and¬†Lyft¬†are both offering free rides to the polls.

ID Requirements

You DO need an ID, but the ID CAN be expired. If you are denied voting for any reason, including an expired ID request a provisional ballot.¬†More on Tennesse ID requirements

Early Voting

Early voting has started

Now until to November 1, 2018. In Tennessee you are allow to vote at ANY early voting location, it does not have to be in your county or precinct. To find your early voting locations view this link,¬†https://tnsos.org/elections/election_commissions.php

Absentee Voting

For your early vote to count it must be¬†RECEIVED BEFORE THE POLLS CLOSE ON ELECTION DAY¬†This means it needs to get there the day before or earlier. Don't cut it too close and cheat yourself out of the chance to vote. More information,¬†https://sos.tn.gov/products/elections/absentee-voting

Voting Leave

Tennessee law requires employers to provide employees with a reasonable amount of paid time off to vote up to three (3) hours. To be eligible, an employee:

must not have three (3) or more hours before their shift begins or after their shift ends in which to vote while polls are open, and request the paid voting leave by twelve o'clock (12:00) noon on the day prior to the vote or election. This means if you work an 9am t0 5 pm job, you are entitled to one paid hour off work since the pols in Tennessee are typically open from 7am til 7pm.

"You make a good argument. I too generally believe that use taxes and sales taxes work better for all sorts of reasons. Another benefit is that it taxes people working in the black market.

The downside of things like the gas tax is that they are regressive taxes, hitting the poorest the hardest. Also, electric and hybrid vehicles are more expensive than gas vehicles, so the poor and lower-middle classes really aren't in that market. Also, these taxes are not being offered as a replacement for any other taxes, such as income tax. So, we're getting this in addition to all the other taxes. Many of us have had it and just vote NO for any new state taxes.

California is a very car-centric culture, so I can't wait until everything on the road is electric. The odd thing is that they're charging extra for registration of electric vehicles because they don't pay gas taxes. I don't drive electric, but I think that's a bad idea. If we want people to move to electric, then we shouldn't charge them extra fees for doing so.

As for driving across the border, as you point out, it's just way too inconvenient for most people. We've got Mexico to the south, ocean to the west, the Sierra Nevada mountain range to the east, and sparsely populated areas to the north. We're pretty much stuck buying gasoline here.

"A whole lotta luck, a little hard work, and an open mind. I followed my gut picking colleges and happened to end up in an engineering program that tech companies were targeting.

In particular, Microsoft put a lot of attention onto us, and our assigned recruiter was really great ‚Äì she didn't just sign people up for whatever, but really tried to understand what role each individual would be great at and set us up with the right team. A couple of my friends ended interning there as PMs right before our senior year, and they started telling me that they thought I'd be really good at it. I'd never heard of product management at all, but I started to think about it more and more. Even though I ended going to graduate school to study UX design I couldn't shake the thought that I might be better in a more interdisciplinary role. It definitely didn't hurt that a few of the other students who'd worked in the field for a while nudged me and said I acted a lot like a PM. So when I was finishing grad school I connected with that same recruiter from Microsoft, got a few introductions, and the rest has been history.

It has really been happenstance after happenstance. If I'd set my sights on a different college, or made different friends, or not met that one recruiter, I'd be in a completely different place. I'm in a field that I had never heard of until I was 20; there's no way that I could have planned this out for myself."

"Kind of? He used to be in the employ of the House of Saud (and thus a royalist), if you consider them to be a terrorist organization. And he did support Bin Laden at the same time that the CIA was supporting Bin Laden. At that time, though, Bin Laden was just fighting the Soviets within Afghanistan, and by all accounts Khashoggi was upset when Bin Laden turned to acts of terror abroad. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Like many Saudis in the 1980s, Mr. Khashoggi cheered for the jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan, which was supported by the C.I.A. and Saudi Arabia. So when he got an invitation to see it for himself from another young Saudi, Bin Laden, Mr. Khashoggi jumped at the chance.

\&gt;In Afghanistan, Mr. Khashoggi wore local dress and had his photo taken holding an assault rifle, much to his editors‚Äô chagrin. But it does not appear that he actually fought while on assignment there.

"There's actually historical precedence for it. Back in the newspaper days where games didn't get much coverage keeping up with the NBA was largely just boxscores, showing the updated standings, and then showing the team's record over the last 10 games to give a sense of the team's momentum. If all you knew was a team had a tough road trip with few home games and they went .500 in the stretch not a reason to panic, if they had an easy stretch of home games and only won 2 or 3 games time to start calling for the coach to be fired.
I know yahoo carried it over to their standings format, unsure if other websites have as well. "

You obviously don't want ""everyone to work together."" You incorrectly feel entitled and superior (hint: you're not special).

And you think women ""don't survive on an even playing field?"" Truly, you're a moron and obviously have zero authentic relationships with any women.

No no no no nooooooo. It's *your* whining. Don't rope anyone else into it. You don't need a handout because ""you're more feminine."" You need a handout because you're whining and _want_ the world to be handed to you. There's a world of difference."

&gt;You say all these different countries of different sizes(but yeah, there are only two different sizes of countries, murica-sized and very small, right?), just work because they are small?

I was only trying to talk about smaller countries, since expanding the scope would bring on a bunch of extra points like why Japan and Nigeria are similar is size but not quality of life, and then we have to talk about colonialism and decolonization and its gets to be a mess. I only mentioned smaller countries cause it was something I could very briefly talk about. 

Costa rica is comparable to your smaller states since yeah they are so small it would actually be conceivable for a leader to visit the entire country in one term. Not saying that they would or should but that it is a measure of how effective one might be in leading. they don't have to worry about one part of the country doing much better then the rest because there kinda only is one part of the country when it is all in exaggerated walking distance. and again not saying every country must be like this but that it is clearly working for all of the ones I mentioned.

"Look, I'm just as annoyed as anyone that the beta is only gonna be a few hours here and there, but let's get one thing clear: no one paid for the beta, they paid for the full game. And they're going to get the full game when it releases on November 14, and at that point they can play as much as they want. The beta is just a bonus for purchasing the game before release. In fact, if people wanted, they could cancel their preorders, get their money back, and continue playing the beta - for free. In fact, a lot of people are doing just that based on what I've seen.

Not defending Bethesda or speaking to the merits of the game itself, I couldn't care less about what you think of either of them. Maybe someone doesn't like the game, and thinks it's a waste of $60, that's fine, but saying the beta is a waste of money is like saying you wasted money on the free drill bit that comes with a pack of deck screws. You paid for the screws, not the drill bit, so even if it's a shitty drill bit, you still got the screws you paid for. Except in this case, it would be like if you were allowed to return the screws and keep the shitty drill bit until it breaks in a couple weeks."

"Unfortunately this is a project that grew out of the need to analyse data for the Gamepedia Arena Tier List which is already dedicated to T19.5. Since score optimal builds and the cheerleading, bonus kill feeding play style that is encouraged actively undermine the purpose of a T20+ tier list, there was no plan to analyse the enemy units within upper tiers.   

The forecast for defense teams at those tiers are rather simple, all your top armors at 5+10 with score optimal builds.  The variety at the top end is even less than in T19.5, limited by BST and score potential of units.    

It just never seemed worth investing the huge amounts of time into to get such small reward. "

"I do online sex work - you'd be surprised how much it actually does help them. My specialty is in BDSM/Domme stuff. When my clients start working with me, most are newish, still hung up one the ex that introduced them to kink, or just generally not very confident. I lose most of these type clients within six months or so because they 9/10 end up getting into the IRL kink scene.

Basically a lot of guys just need a crutch for a while. Everyone gets into slumps. The problem is when guys continue to throw money at sex workers and not putting any effort into improving their lives IRL. Usually tho, by the time it reaches that point, they are no longer interested in improving their lives, they've become complacent.

So idk, I think you're not giving grown ass adult men enough credit. 99 out of 100 know exactly what theyre doing, and 90 out of a hundred move on to better things."

"I'm not saying there's a full-on conspiracy of the transes plotting while twirling their mustaches in a dark room, but the general behavior of trans people is to make sure that no wedge is ever made between themselves and natal female people, and they will appropriate whatever language is necessary to make sure the two groups are always conflated into one. You can see it with how the terminology has changed over time. 

First it was ""I was born a boy and transitioned to become a woman""

Then it was ""I was born a boy but was a woman inside all along""

Which became ""I wasn't born a boy, I was assigned male at birth""

and now it's at the point where it's become ""I am biologically female"" which you can see on Twitter right now, with trans women appropriating the hashtag ""AdultHumanFemale"" which was started by GC women. 

Each of these shifts in the mainstream trans rhetoric was the result of natal female people saying ""okay, sure you can be X, but we're going to go over here and be Y"". Whether they're doing it consciously or subconsciously, the end result is the same, natal female people are not to define themselves separately from trans women because they are what make the word ""woman"" valuable in the first place. Without their inclusion, the word is meaningless.

If there's a public bus that goes from sovereign Cyprus territory to sovereign British territory then my guess as a Cypriot would be that any member of the general public should be allowed to get off at the destination within the sovereign area. Its very lax in general, and there are many Cypriot nationals living in the sovereign British areas as the people living in the villages under those areas were never displaced when the sovereign bases were established. Any areas you aren't allowed to enter will be marked as such with barbed wire, fences etc. I wouldn't worry about it personally, do your thing as long as you're not climbing over barbed wire and entering British military complexes without permission.

Its such a nice feeling for the game to be coming out of early release given that everything which has gone on since dean left which had an certain unknown outcome to start of with for the game, effictively since that has all settles down and been resolved the devs have only had a couple of years putting together the newer version of the game in the new engine so in retro spective they are doing a bloody good job. At the end of the day you bought an early release game which states this is in no way the complete version of the game and features etc will be missing for some time etc. These items will be well in the game before the go to full release and come away from the beta version.

""Planet"" is a concept.  ""Sun"" is a concept.  ""Orbit"" is a concept.  These are all things that we have created in order to comprehend the universe.  The question of whether or not Pluto is or is not a planet, i.e. whether or not it fits into the concept of ""planet,"" is irrelevant to Pluto's physical properties, how it behaves.

&gt;The group exists anyway, whether the things are close together or not.

I'm sorry, what?  Please use fewer pronouns, it's confusing as to what you are referring to.

&gt;You could say the same thing about anything in the world.

If you think that to be the case, then you have no understanding of what I am saying.  You are failing to differentiate the concept of an object or phenomenon from the object or phenomenon itself.  ""Apple"" corresponds to a specific arrangement of matter that we frequently observe.  ""Group"" doesn't.  It's an organizational tool used by the mind.  There is no type specimen for the concept, ""group.""

&gt; Theoretically, the mind might have some components that are based on a physical substrate and others that aren't. 

You apparently missed the word, ""entirely.""

&gt;I am saying that the OP's argument provides support for it. (Yes, it's possible for there to be a sound argument that supports a particular conclusion without that conclusion being more likely than not.)

OP's argument is neither valid nor sound.

&gt;I'm not going to spend the rest of my life thinking up thousands of ways to say the same thing,

I'm asking for you to think of a second way.  Don't be hyperbolic.

&gt;But that doesn't tell you which one you are, objectively. If one of the creatures is a human and the other is a mouse, knowing that you are the one whose viewpoint you are experiencing tells you nothing about whether you're the human or the mouse.

I don't need to know whether I'm a human or a mouse for my consciousness to be obligately bound to and shaped by the form that I occupy.

&gt;Yes. But more importantly, I need to employ observation to know which of two people sitting on the bus I am.

I don't think you do.  You may need to employ observation to determine all but one of ways in which you are different from the person across from you, but short of a genuine OOBE (which I don't believe is likely) you already know that you are you.

&gt;How so?

As I already stated, multiple commenters have already gone into that.  OP is basically making the argument that it's impossible for anyone to win the lottery because the odds are so vanishingly small, ignoring the fact that (to an extent, because I realize that not all lotteries work the same) the lottery must always be won by *someone*.

&gt;You still don't automatically know which of the various objectively existing brains is the one you're in.

You don't have to know which brain is yours.  If I reasoned that someone else's brain was mine, nothing about reality would change."

"I disagree of course. As far as i can tell no human being on the face of this planet...deserves..to be discriminated against because of their race. Not even racist white people. Sure, the people of color (asians, etc) could have spoken up much much much sooner. Sure, it would have literally been in their own best interests. Hell, speaking up against racism literally helps all of humanity in more than a few ways. Mainly because advancements in humanity do not go by race. While racism literally stunts humanity's growth potential. But, that doesn't mean they deserve what they're getting because they didn't fight against racism or even if they fought for it.

What's happening to them and what happened to them is just the logical conclusion of either supporting racism or steering clear of doing anything about it. It's like being a room with a massively gassy person. Sure, you can try to ignore it but everyone knows you smell it and you can even tell everyone it isn't the person who clearly ripped ass. Problem with that last part is the person playing booty trumpets is literally telling everyone in the area they're the ones that did it/are constantly doing it.

Point is...everyone with a working brain and a healthy understanding knows. What they're getting and will get isn't something they deserve..it's what they begged for countless times. It doesn't matter to me if they helped racism or if they ignored it. Cause a defense against racism/bigotry isn't automatically helping those who helped it exist or helping those who ignore it.

If humanity were to be able to get rid of racism/bigotry tomorrow...those people would still be unhealthy in thinking and would just find another way to punish themselves over it. So no, they don't actually deserve but..with their mindsets...they already think they do and punish themselves accordingly by supporting racism/bigotry or just ignoring it."

"&gt; When Democrats ""gerrymander"" you get results basically close to in line with representation that is proportional to the percentage support among the populace and various demographics. 

That doesn't make any sense. If, as presidential popular vote results suggest, there are more Democrats than Republicans, then the ideal Democrat gerrymander in blue states is to distribute Republicans as evenly as possible across all districts and take them all, and there have to be red states where you can consolidate a few Democratic cores into blue districts. That would give Democrats a lead in the house that's far larger than their mild popular edge."

Being asked to leave is being kicked out. That‚Äôs the very fucking definition of the word. 

&gt; Guy already proved himself to be a dick, expecting him to throw the pizza on the ground is a pretty reasonable assumption and if you work around that shit you probably expect it.

&gt; Absolutely not, that dude was a person just like anyone else and being a waiter doesn't all of a sudden make him some kind of floor mat. If anything fuck that dudes boss for empowering a guy like that to put one of his employees in that situation.


Guy proved himself a dick cause he gave a bad review? Wtf? Who the fuck thinks it‚Äôs a ‚Äúreasonable assumption‚Äù to think the guy would litter? That‚Äôs not normal at all. And no, you show that video to any employer and ask if that would be acceptable for an employee and 9/10 would say no. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs cold, I‚Äôm sorry about that sir, let me run in and get you a fresh slice‚Äù is the way a normal fucking **food service** employee should act.

The guy is a pizza reviewer with a large following. The owner was excited for him to come in and try their pizza. He knows what a review from Barstool can do for business. Same as any other reviewer with a large following, professional chef or not. It‚Äôs not that fucking hard to grasp.

"The dialogue ends inconclusively, like many dialogues from Plato's so-called early period. One point that Socrates was trying to make was that virtue cannot be taught, as he was testing Protagoras who claims that he can teach virtue or good judgment. But he also contests Protagoras' view that all virtues are not one and the same thing, namely, that wisdom is not the same as courage, which is not the same as temperance, nor piety, and so on.

As the dialogues goes on Socrates argues in ways such that in the end he is appears to be making the point that all virtues are just wisdom or knowledge. But as you said, that would mean that virtue can be taught, which is the opposite of what Socrates was arguing for earlier in the dialogue; namely, that virtue cannot be taught. So, which is it? Socrates didn't claim to know, and he wanted to continue to engage in discussion with Protagoras to find out the truth about the nature of virtue, but Protagoras suggested they do this some other time, and the dialogue ends at that point."

"Unless you get super lucky, a sub 20k 2015 Merc Coupe will be impossible to find my friend. They still go for 14-18k for 60-70k KM so. Try looking around. If not, consider the other models. The new coupes come with AWD and the 4 doors too. If you're in a snowy area, do not take RWD. Biggest mistake there. I've done it with a 335i back in the day, HUGE MISTAKE. Doesn't work, and you will hate having to roll much slower and being scared of over steering every 2 seconds.

Make the right choices. If I were you, at a 20k budget, just look for either something with more miles or a different model. 60k Miles should be fine.

"It is insanely difficult to keep long, natural nails; they break so easily doing normal, everyday tasks.  Reinforced nails such as acrylic or hard gel typically last about a month and are something you see constantly.  Granted, i do my own nails now specifically because i didnt want to spend so much.  However, I spend anywhere from 2-6 hours on my nails depending on how crazy i want them.  It also does take a significant amount of skill and practice.  I totally get why others would be willing to pay whatever for the convenience and experience of getting their nails done.  One of my favorite memories is the first time my mom took me out to get my nails done professionally.  We got it done together and i was allowed to get whatever i wanted.  I felt like a respected adult (even though i was 12).  Also consider how many people have jobs and can make a living because many people like the aesthetic of fake nails.

If you are planning on voting in this election in Tennessee here are some things you should know.

This is a close race to keep the red state red.

Uber¬†and¬†Lyft¬†are both offering free rides to the polls.

ID Requirements

You DO need an ID, but the ID CAN be expired. If you are denied voting for any reason, including an expired ID request a provisional ballot.¬†More on Tennesse ID requirements

Early Voting

Early voting has started

Now until to November 1, 2018. In Tennessee you are allow to vote at ANY early voting location, it does not have to be in your county or precinct. To find your early voting locations view this link,¬†https://tnsos.org/elections/election_commissions.php

Absentee Voting

For your early vote to count it must be¬†RECEIVED BEFORE THE POLLS CLOSE ON ELECTION DAY¬†This means it needs to get there the day before or earlier. Don't cut it too close and cheat yourself out of the chance to vote. More information,¬†https://sos.tn.gov/products/elections/absentee-voting

Voting Leave

Tennessee law requires employers to provide employees with a reasonable amount of paid time off to vote up to three (3) hours. To be eligible, an employee:

must not have three (3) or more hours before their shift begins or after their shift ends in which to vote while polls are open, and request the paid voting leave by twelve o'clock (12:00) noon on the day prior to the vote or election. This means if you work an 9am t0 5 pm job, you are entitled to one paid hour off work since the pols in Tennessee are typically open from 7am til 7pm.

Such as Khadgar being basically invulnerable while in his Ice Block in the Tomb of Sargeras audiodrama (seriously), and Gul'dan waving away multiple physical and magical projectiles shot at him with an absent thought in the same audiodrama.

Both of them are immensely powerful, and while a single blow could easily kill either one of them, if they're awares, they are almost certainly going to find a way to keep themselves alive."

"I think there is considerable diversity in what is considered center-right. I like the answer /u/Sir-Matilda gave with the different types of ideologies, some of which have contradictory views (Neocons often disagree with other center-right folk with a more isolationist lean, and social conservatives who are economically farther left may clash pretty intensely with libertarians.)

I think I would personally include *all* the examples you gave as potentially center-right, although conservative Democrats these days may more accurately fall under center-left, given how the Democrats have been voting as a bloc a good bit more in recent years.

I think of myself as more center-right than most Republicans would label me as, and I think this disconnect is due to the fact that (a) the GOP has moved more to the extreme right over the course of my life (b) most Republicans don't see just how much I get shut-down and shut-out of the discourse in most left-wing circles...yes, I may have a lot of disconnects with right-wing ideology, but right-wingers don't necessarily see that I have equally strong or even more severe disconnections with left-wing ideology.

I also have a dispute with a lot of self-identified conservatives. I think a lot of people nowadays who call themselves ""conservative"" are not really conservative at all. Reasons include (a) rejection of the free market (b) rejection of (or only doing lipservice to) fiscal conservatism (c) only using federalism opportunistically (i.e. to advance a socially conservative agenda) and throwing it out the window when it doesn't advance your particular goals (d) radical questioning of and rejection of traditional social institutions, including attempting to dismantle or undermine basic function of government and the political system, undermine the free press (all the ""mainstream media"" is fake news! *National Review* and *Weekly Standard* are left-wing trash because they don't sing Trump's praises!), reject basic norms of decency and respect, making nods to, and occasionally even embracing white supremacy and xenophobia. These trends have made me increasingly feel like the Republican party is no longer a conservative party and has become some degree of pseudo-right-wing populism and nationalism.

For me, the reasons I consider myself more center-right than center-left:

* I'm very fiscally conservative and this is a high priority for me.
* I tend to want government to be small, simple, and transparent. I want regulation to be simple and minimal, ideally, business regulation to be such that it's easy to follow and guides businesses in the direction of best practices -- government working with business rather than against it.
* I tend to oppose tax-and-spend solutions to problems, and believe in the idea of ""Just because a problem exists doesn't mean it's the government's role to solve it.""
* I tend to want to solve problems by looking first to see if there are any ways government is spending or enforcing laws or regulations that are creating or worsening the problem, and fixing or eliminating these problems *first* before creating new laws.
* I tend to support free markets and oppose market interventions, including subsidies and price fixing, which includes things like minimum wage and rent control.
* I want to preserve and protect a huge portion of traditional social institutions. I tend to assume that things are the way they are for a reason and if I don't see compelling reasons to change something, I tend to err on the side of wanting to keep it as-is and focus on something else.
* In some ways I want to ""return to an earlier era"" so I can even be a little bit reactionary. Some of my more reactionary views include skepticism of new technologies and the effect social media is having on our society, support for more traditional farming methods and opposition to the industrialization of our food supply, and support for homemakers and families with only one parent working, and the social fabric that arises out of communities made up of such families.
* I tend to have a Christian-influenced stance on forgiveness and ""turn the other cheek"" attitude, which seems completely absent from the left these days. I.e. no matter how much my political opponents do so, I don't ever want to stoop to personal attacks, slander, etc. I also don't think social shaming is an acceptable way to advance issues. I see a lot of the ""punch a Nazi"" rhetoric and it *really disturbs* me, in part because I see that going hand-in-hand with Nazi-like ideology on the right.
* I really reject what I call the ""pissing contest"" of oppression politics that has become increasingly mainstream in left-wing circles these days.

That said, there are points where I disconnect strongly with what is often considered center-right:

* I support progressive taxation.
* In spite of being rabidly pro-free-market, I am somewhat skeptical of capitalism (I make a distinction between free markets and capitalism) and the associated concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a small elite, and I want this kept in check and I *do* see the government as having an interest in keeping it in check.
* I am pretty liberal on LGBTQ issues, even though I don't agree with everything to come out of LGBTQ activism. I support same-sex marriage, even some stances considered pretty radical such as supporting polyamory. This is why I identify as a ""social independent"" -- I am conservative or even reactionary in the sense of wanting 2+ parent households with at least one homemaker raising children -- but I'm pretty radical in accepting polyamorous households, same sex partners, trans peeople, and all sorts of things rejected by social conservatives.
* I think left-wing ""oppression"" discourse has some truth to it, i.e. things like white privilege and institutional racism being real problems, heteronormativity, etc., even if I don't agree with everything being said by the activists on the left working on these issues.
* I am rabidly anti-car, and for some reason this is associated more as a ""liberal"" issue in the public consciousness. I tend to see my opposition to cars as an issue with government subsidy (i.e. subsidizing roads and car use.) but it does result in some left-wing stances, like a strong support for public transit systems.

Does this make me center-right or center-left? I don't know. I think I have a center-right way of thinking with a smattering of solid-left views thrown in.

But one thing I know for sure: I'm a bit of a weirdo, which is why I picked my flair as a ""moderate weirdo"".

Then you must really hate the Internet as a whole because there are thousands of pedophiles on it. A few bad people in a group doesn't represent the entire group.
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm saying just because they have lied or because another homeless person lied doesn‚Äôt mean they should be written off. Someone on this thread said they should all die.

"half full fire boxes result in an inefficient fire, producing more smoke than necessary, you basically waste wood. 

Buy a set of light weight insulating fire bricks, you can cut them to fit with any hand saw, put em in and bob is your uncle, you can do the same by leaving a ton of spent ashes in the bottom letting the firebox fill up. I usually let the fire box fill with ashes in the early spring, only shoveling them out when it looks lie we are getting some really cold weather. "

"PRL has been out performing the market for approximately one week of the past ~32 weeks (~8 months). Are you going to make a post for every single week in the future, or just post on weeks with favorable results?"

"Have you tried UserTesting? I'm not sure if it's any different in Canada, but so far I've been able to bring in a minimum of $20-$40 a month and it's not very time consuming. It's definitely worth looking into."

"Yeah good point, although I must say I' m tired of rovers lmao. I just wish they'd maybe focus on the SLS and Orion a little more since it's the next step towards getting people on mars. Although I do get that asteroid missions are key to getting to mars as well.
