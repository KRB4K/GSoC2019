If we talk about, who the greatest heavy weight boxer of all time was, then I think Ali and Joe Louis are close.
It‚Äôs fair to discuss, which of them were the best, but its indisputable, that they are the two greatest heavy weight boxers of all time.

"Not justifying the article but it seems to me that they start off painting the guy as an idyllic southerner wishing to go back to old ways, then proceeds to go on about his private beliefs in an attempt to paint him as what I can only describe as ""the enemy"" to what people view as modern society. It's kind of sad. Both in the way the article portrays him and the fact that he holds views that while I disagree, do not seem to be hurting anyone. He doesn't seem to be going out of his way to spread dangerous ideology or even negatively affect anyone else.

"&gt; I've done 5 figures in sales the past 1-2 months, given them plenty of money and I can't even get into contact with them?

exactly what u/redem said. The fact that you do 5 figures in sales means precisely dick to Amazon. My late shipment rate broke 10% when I was dropshipping. Before Amazon had the chance to suspend my account I sent a plan of action stating that I was disabling my listings, cutting ties with my warehouse and going to be manufacturing the product myself. As the days went by with no new sales, my late shipment rate went up to 15% and my account was never once suspended. I got my shop set up and 3 months later, I'm SFP with 100% metrics across the board. 

It irks me when other people say it on the seller forums, but here I find myself saying it. The problem isn't that you can't get in touch with Amazon, the problem is you can't seem to ship on time. Amazon wants to know why you can't ship on time, and what steps you will take to correct that. That's all. If you can not, or will not give them that information, they have no reason to reach out to you. It's Amazon's show, and we're all just guests there. If you don't agree with the way they do business, you can sell elsewhere.

&gt; President Donald Trump routinely calls old friends, business partners, and confidants on his personal iPhone while in the White House, giving Chinese and Russia spies easy access to his personal communications and interests, reports The New York Times.

&gt; The story cites American intelligence reports, which detail how Trump aides have repeatedly warned the president not to use his personal iPhone and to use the secure White House landline instead. Despite the warnings, Trump continues to take personal cellphone calls, and the White House has resolved to simply hoping the president doesn&amp;#039;t discuss classified matters over the phone.

&gt; Trump&amp;#039;s third iPhone is a standard one no different than any of the millions of devices used by Americans every day, and Trump reportedly uses it to call people because he can store his contacts in it.

The key is as soon as you control a point, get to another as fast as possible, so you can gain control.  Try to get 3 under control, and then just watch for any conflicts, and haul ass towards the next one under conflict.

If you start taking heavy fire on one station, and another is under conflict, move to the other.  The enemies seem to mostly converge on a single point at a time.

As long as you can keep any two constantly going, and toggle the other half, you should get it.  The important thing is getting a jump on it from the start.

"The carrying out of acts generally believed to be contradicting to the standard human moral code of right and wrong (in this case referred to as being unclean, meaning wrong), and the perceived monetary value of said acts being below what one would consider a ‚Äúgood price‚Äù; a good price being that the monetary value and the real value of the deed are equal, or the value of the deed is greater than that of the money paid for it to be carried out.

&gt; President Donald Trump routinely calls old friends, business partners, and confidants on his personal iPhone while in the White House, giving Chinese and Russia spies easy access to his personal communications and interests, reports The New York Times.

&gt; The story cites American intelligence reports, which detail how Trump aides have repeatedly warned the president not to use his personal iPhone and to use the secure White House landline instead. Despite the warnings, Trump continues to take personal cellphone calls, and the White House has resolved to simply hoping the president doesn&amp;#039;t discuss classified matters over the phone.

&gt; Trump&amp;#039;s third iPhone is a standard one no different than any of the millions of devices used by Americans every day, and Trump reportedly uses it to call people because he can store his contacts in it.

"OP's ask is ridiculous in every way. His performace, as self-described, is poor trending to competent. NOBODY gives a 20% raise for that. 

As for how raises are earned, maybe we work in different job sectors.  Throughout my career, I've earned and given rewards based on performance against a job description, not against over team mates.  What you're describing is called stack-ranking, and it is fucking horrific for the employees.

We describe a job -- say, senior project manager -- and all of the responsibilities of the role.  Your performance is judged against that job description.  Usually this is coupled with some kind of agreement with your manager about specific goals and objectives for you specifically.

It is all very objective, easily tracked, and usually fucked up anyway because managers are human and usually poorly trained and kinda shitty at their jobs.

"&gt;Where you see an energized Democratic party I'm seeing people being outraged and seeing voting for them as their only solution.

I don't see what the difference is.  Democrats make up the Democratic party.  They're energized, they're going to events, rallies, house parties.  They're doing GOTV activities.  They're doing what a party does when it's organized.  Have you worked with the party before?  You should, it can really help you understand how what looks like ""people being outraged"" is part of the party organization at work.

Got a rough BYE week next week.. I have only 1 aquistion left

&amp;#x200B;

Picked up Allison and Amendola this week 

WRS: **Jeffrey, Green, Amendola, Crabtree, Allison, and Fitzgerald**

&amp;#x200B;

I want to pick up Tyrell Williams while he is available and on BYE.. but I don't know if I should drop Fitzgerald for him or anyone else.. I feel stupid to spend 5 on Amendola just to drop him already ( I wasnt expecting to get Allison for $5 so I put a waiver in for both Amendola and Allison.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. Im thinking of trying to wait until Fitzgerald or Amendola play and after they play drop them for Williams if they do bad.. but worried he might get picked up before then. Is it worth picking up T. Williams and dropping Fitzgerald or someone else? (I wont play Fitzgerald this week anyways and he has BYE next week.. but I feel like he has a chance with this new OC.

&amp;#x200B;

Is Tyrell Williams worth it?"

Or do you mean that the Gulf coast refineries refine Middle Eastern oil for export of the products to other parts of the world?  In the short term there'd need to be an adjustment as petroleum gets shifted from export to transfer within the US and refineries get re-tuned for different grades of oil, but in the medium term that's not a big deal relative to the 1973-type oil crisis you seem to be envisioning."

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

I think we're just arguing over different moral priorities.  I'm sure as hell not going to become a liar just to back up    a family member who's trying to deceive the public.

We live in a small town where a man's word still means something, and I'm in a family that has earned a lot of trust around here.  If I had a brother and he was dishonest, that in itself would be a betrayal.  I wouldn't it all feel like I was betraying him if I just opened my mouth and said ""Hey, that's not right.""

Now if he was smoking pot and we were talking about the cops, I'd lie my ass off.

Over the last 50-75 years, the US has been the main aggravator, assassinating democratically elected politicians, overthrowing governments, funneling money into protests and activists around the world. **By far.**

"Shitty people is nothing new. Intentionally hiring shitty people OVER rule following workers so that you can get people to deliver cheaper results than possible without breaking the law is fairly new to the US.

Amazon has a shell company that they contract (whose only contractor is Amazon) to further contract individual people hired through an app who can only meet their contract if they break the law. They do so to skirt minimum wage laws as well as have two layers of protection away from the actions of people who, realistically, are their direct employees.

If you look at that, and say, ""wow, the problem is that people are bad workers!"" You gotta be fucked in the head. Bad workers exist, and have always existed. But Amazon made a system where the bad get work over good workers. Now people are all surprised at bad work.

Ridiculous. Just ridiculous."

The person I was talking to seemed to be concerned that the governor might try to make that slight bump sound like some big achievement for political purposes, regardless of what the data are actually saying.

"I‚Äôm baffled honestly. JB has years of treating people horribly under his belt...it‚Äôs why he‚Äôs still on the show after all these years. Just because he‚Äôs not on top this season and working the victim ‚Äúpoor me‚Äù edit people feel bad for him. These past few seasons he‚Äôs been such a hypocrite. Is Devin a hypocrite? Yes. But the difference is that Johnny has YEARS of bad history and has shown very little redeeming qualities OR change for as long as he‚Äôs been on the show. Devin can have his time to learn and grow, Jonny has had his time and shown very little growth. 


Johnny has said before that he thinks of himself as a producer of the show because he knows what footage to give them. He is *without a doubt* finessing this victim edit and giving them what they need for it...and people are falling for it. The ‚Äúhe was pushed to his breaking point‚Äù bullshit makes me sick. There have been worse situations on the show where people NEVER went that low or low at all. Johnny is weak and can never take what he dished out, period. 

I do believe he actually thinks he‚Äôs been the victim these past few seasons, but he‚Äôs just getting a taste of his own medicine. Johnny basically opened the door for the type of behavior Devin and TYBs displayed in last night‚Äôs episode. I think Devin and Johnny are both ‚Äúdirty‚Äù players, but they‚Äôre different morally which is why they‚Äôll never get along. I don‚Äôt think a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person would think to *actually* bring up someone‚Äôs late father FOUR weeks after they‚Äôve passed away. He could‚Äôve said so many other things about/to Devin..and that‚Äôs where he went? If the tables were turned, I don‚Äôt think Devin would‚Äôve ever went that low. Not only that, but Devin has been on the right side of a lot of wrong situations on the show, including ones where Johnny was on the opposing side.

"When the right wing starts losing control again you can bet your ass there is going to be more violence. With individuals already so far gone that they will resort to violence at mere accusations against democrats from their daily propaganda sources there will be much more of it once they think that a coup is taking place just because votes aren't in their favor anymore. There are so many powder kegs waiting to go off and many that have just barely been averted that there will be lots of blood on the streets before they settle down again. They're already 'marching' on the streets in their tacticool gear to show off guns, threaten their peers, call for and celebrate violence against minorities and the overall cult-like mentality is straight out of a textbook. A lot of people would benefit from watching either the 1981 film The Wave, the 2008 film of the same name (or Die Welle in the original german) or the book by the same name, all of which were inspired by the 1967 experiment [""The Third Wave""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Wave_(experiment))

There's so many parallels with 1930s Germany that unless there's a drastic shift soon it's inevitable for attacks against immigrants to ramp up as they've been selected as the 21st century replacement for jews as scapegoats.

"The second set is definitely more situational, depending on your deck. For example, as Ironclad you sometimes can afford to take Coffee Dripper (heal from Burning Blood and if you have good block or Reaper) or Velvet Choker (You probably aren't playing more than 6 cards in a turn unless you're playing a Dropkick deck).

Fusion Hammer and Philosopher's Stone I'll only take if I'm dying for an energy relic, especially after Act 2 boss. I'm surprised you lumped in Busted Crown and Runic Dome. The former seems to have a minor downside but it prevents you from having options to build your deck. If you have a good deck/archetype already, Busted Crown is viable, but that's not often by Act 1 boss. Runic Dome is very ""skill-testing"" if you go against enemies with set patterns (Head, Nemesis) but I feel it increases your risk of dying because you have to guess whether or not to play defensively or offensively a turn. Will Chosen Hex on turn 1, or will you get hit for 18? Which of the three Darklings will attack, if any?"

"&gt; And a majority of the world is still religious. Heck, the Netherlands is the first European country that, less than a month ago, has 50% of its population self-identify as non-religious.

"C'mon man telling me to go back to a game from a past generation of gaming consoles was a bit silly and many would call that passive aggressive. Lol. I'm still enjoying this game I just think that a lot of these RPG mechanics seem forced or half thought out and not ""at home"" in a game like this. I get that you enjoy the game the way it is and think it's fine, I also enjoy the game the way it is, but I think certain aspects were bad design choices. That's all there is to it. 

My build is honestly probably really good for my level. I do tons of side quests and optional things to help my character. I upgrade my best stuff every other time I level up. 

I guess what I am trying to say is that I honestly would prefer it if I could kill all enemies in 3-10 hits but I could die in 1-3 hits myself. The game would be a LOT harder like that but then I wouldn't have to spam a dozen combos to kill every enemy that has a name above their head. Fights would be more tense too. I tried hard mode hoping it would be like that but hard mode doesn't increase your damage, it just increases the damage you take. The AI doesn't seem to change either, the damage just goes up. Feels lazy. Like they just changed a few parameters and that's it.

I just don't like overly tanky enemies in RPGs and I personally think that even the basic enemies are too tanky in this game. The only time I can kill enemies in a way I would say looks or feels realistic is when they are 5 levels or more beneath me. Those times look awesome though because all of a sudden your weapons handle realistically when normally they seem to be made of wood.

The game isn't bad or anything I'm just stating my reasons why I think I will forget about it within the next few months... and with red dead redemption coming out in less than 2 days I am starting to doubt I will even finish this new A.C. game at all. As a longtime fan of the series I'm starting to care less because they don't have a clear vision for the game series mechanics. Changing it this much in the span of a few releases bothers me. Of course things have to change and update in order to innovate but to me it feels like they just made assassin's creed into a clone of the witcher series and are losing the things I loved about the past entries. This isn't the old assassin's creed in many ways. Both good and bad.  

You're right i should have researched the game more, but I was excited to get it on release because I missed the past few assassin's creed games and now I'm realizing the game has changed into a totally different game than it used to be. I guess next time I'll wait til after release and watch some more reviews before I buy. The main issue is that I'm finding I disagree with many of the current reviews giving it 8s and 9s and even 10s. I give it a solid 7 or 7.5. It's not bad but I can't think of anything that makes this game great. 

What are the best parts of the game in your opinion? What do you like the most? Is there anything you dislike?

"**Is this true?** I asked my Thai friend how the Thais really feel about Malays. I want the honest answer and told him he doesn't need to be polite nor worry I may get offended.

He said a bulk of Thai people actually look down on the Malays, in parts due to the southern insurgency, and that many see Malays as less progressive. In most of Siam's histories, Siam was more powerful than the Malay states in today's West Malaysia.

On the other hands, the Thai people have deep admiration for the Chinese. The Chinese operate a lot of businesses, are fair-skinned, and Buddhists just like most Thais. They control over 80% of Thai economy. Most of the richest people in Thailand are ethnic Chinese. Most past Thai prime ministers were Chinese or mixed Chinese. The Thais look at them as an inspiration or model, to the extent Chinese only made up 15% of Thailand population but another 35% of Thais claim they have mixed Chinese ancestry. 

The same admiration is extended to the Japanese and Koreans. The Thais also have fascination for farangs (Caucasians from North America and Europe)."

I think the middle ground we need is team-based matching in regular comp, like how overwatch does it. 4 stacks match 4 stacks, solos match solos. It would boost the population as it would attract way more solos and duos. And 4 stacks can still sweat other 4 stacks, or choose to play solo. "

That doesn't solve the border issue.

The DUP will collapse the government if the Government tries to pass an Irish Sea border.  And the EU will never sign a deal installing a hard land border in violation of a highly successful 20 year peace treaty.  

The red lines violate one another.  There is no squaring of them.  There are earth shattering disincentives against either side to capitulating on this issue.  It's why negotiations broke down last week.

As yet, no deal has even been proposed that might possibly pass both the HoC and EU.  Time is rapidly running down.  Within a month or so, there will be no more time to negotiate and enact a scheme.  The only choices will be ""No Deal"" or Remain."

"Ultimate Hunter is significantly more useful for Karthus now that you can stack it on kill instead of on ult cast.

But wouldn't Aerys be better for teamfighting? Especially since the secondary runes from Sorcery are, in general, more useful for Karthus than the Domination secondary runes.

I am speaking that because, for example, nothing from the first row is remotely useful for Karthus, the second row isn't useless but isn't that good either, the third row is really good though and contains Ultimate Hunter and even Ravenous Hunter, that said, you can just get it by picking Domination secondary.

The same doesn't apply to Sorcery, however. First row has Manaflow Band which is amazing for Karthus, add even more mana which synergizes with Archangel's Staff. Nullfying Orb also gives him a situtional rune to use against powerful APs. Second row gives him Transcendence, which gives him even more CDR. It also has Celerity if he prefers movement speed instead. The third row has Gathering Storm, which makes Karthus even more powerful late game."

The Vostok capsule did not have a landing system (The cosmonaut ejected and used a personal parachute), and swimming in a spacesuit is nearly impossible.

If the US did get to him before he drowned, they would certainly have interrogated him/encouraged him to defect. They ultimately would likely have returned him to the USSR. 

The Vostok capsule itself would have sunk immediately. Depending on the depth of the ocean at that location, it may have been irrecoverable. Not that it would have been very interesting to US engineers anyway. The Mercury capsule was much more advanced at this point. "

Kept playing and now still playing partly because of DB love and a way to stay in that universe and whatnot, but more so because I love him to death and it's one of our many nerdy bonds that give us tons of conversation topics and connections as I've been at college away from him for a lot of the past 3-4 years.

"pala recipes il ninnum prajodhanam kondu undakkiyatha.. pratyekichu oru recipe use cheythilla.  measurements onnum ennodu chodikkaruthu.. I was eyeballing everything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Beef - around 2 kg

Onion - 2

Green chili - 3

Ginger(minced)- 3x2 inches piece :D

Garlic(minced) - 8ish cloves

curry leaves - keesha keerillankil veettil ullathellam eduthu idaam.

Chilli powder - 2 tablespoons

Coriander powder - 5 tablespoons

Chicken/Meat masala - 3-4 teaspoons

salt

&amp;#x200B;

**For kaduku vara:**

Coconut oil - enough to fry the onions

Mustard seeds- enough to kaduku vara

Onion - 1

Shallots (kochulli) - 5-6

garlic - 3 cloves

Coconut pieces - as much as you want

curry leaves

Fennel seed powder - 1 teaspoon

Pepper powder - 2 teaspoons

&amp;#x200B;

Again, these measurements aren't 100% accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Pressure cook the beef, salt, ginger, 2 Onions, garlic , green chillies, chilli powder, coriander powder, meat masala and some kariveppila. DO NOT add any water, the beef releases a shit ton of water while cooking. Cook for 3 whistles.

\- In a separate pan, heat some oil, add the mustard seeds, let it splutter, add the shallots and onion, after the onion has browned a bit, add the garlic. You don't want to burn the garlic. Keep browning the onion, then add the coconut pieces and curry leaves. keep stirring until the coconut pieces turn golden.  add the fennel powder and pepper powder. Stir for a few seconds then add the cooked beef.

\- you're going to cook until it turns almost black. It took me 35 minutes to get that color.

Edit :
Adding this here since so many have asked for it. I mostly post my work on IG and talk about my processes and show step by steps there. Just search Suzannemoseley.fineart

One of the questions asked a lot is how long this took : about 16-20 hours over just shy of 3 weeks. I work on multiple projects at once and have a day job that I love so I spread out the work a little bit. The way I work is through several thin layers. This allows the transparency of the oils to shine and gives more depth to the colors. It also means that it's dry to the touch by the next afternoon so I can work very quickly when I need to. 

The other most common question is size : this is 9x12"" panel. The eyes are about the size of a dime each, and the background panting is slightly smaller than a business card for comparison! I used a lot of veery small brushes. :) 

Thank you for the wonderful responses. You guys made me cry! I never expected this much interest. For those that have asked but I haven't responded to you yet, bear with me and I will, it's just after 3AM and I sleep now. 

Also, just gotta share : it's my husbands and my 13 year anniversary today! Woo-hoo! Love you, handsome!

A portion of the right has spent 8 years in this incredibly unfounded, and laughably stupid, idea that Obama, Hillary, and their DNC pals were all apart of this weird/perplexing communist conspiracy. It was a smear campaign all over Fox News, and other strange conservative media heads during the Obama years. Tucker Carlson even called Jeff Bezos and Bernie Sanders of the same ideology, that is how blatantly stupid these people are. 


Imagine what would happen if somehow this progressive movement within the Democratic party picks up steam? Imagine if these people actually were represented, or even lead, by actual progressives, and not establishment DNC neoliberal/corporate shills. The patriot movement created a standing army of gun enthusiasts disillusioned by the weird communist/anti American conspiracies of Obama, with even more sympathetic to their cause.  


To us, it seems stupid. But to them, we are all sheep being herded by the DNC. We will be the target when right wing terrorism becomes common place. Why? Because we embody all of their fears of the Democrats; we are socialists and communists.

"This is awesome! Is it because I asked you to post a Piccolo deck for DAD? Whatever the reason you chose it I'm so happy to see this!

My main deck is this leader and my current build is similar to this. I also lean on the large number of 2 drops that can be grabbed with Planet Namek for 1 energy to fill the board with critical/barrier Piccolos (Jr Driven to Fight and Speed Attack Jr). By turn 4 I've used Namek to get rare King Piccolo in the drop and To Save a Hopeful Future and Kami's Power Piccolo and/or the Strategist in my hand. I play Future to bring out King Piccolo, swing with leader to pump him to 30 000 and swing at my opponent twice with him. Then I activate his Main to put him back in the drop and play Kami's Power (most of the time) or Strategist from my hand. 

If you don't beat your opponent with that you can do it again the next turn because King Piccolo put himself back in the drop.

I haven't seen that Shenron card in detail yet, can it summon anything higher than 2 drop from the discard?"

"I'm genuinely starting to worry it won't even break a million.

For reference, SCIV sold 2 million and was still considered a failure by Bamco, and then SCV only managed to sell 1 million. It still managed to outsell Tekken Tag 2, though, which only really proves how bad *that* game flopped.

And considering how Okubo said that this would be the last game in the series if it didn't sell well...I'm genuinely worried we could soon see Project Soul get closed down sometime soon.

That being said, this could still be chalked up to physical sales across the board taking a bit of a slump, with even AC and COD selling 25% and 50% less physical units at launch respectively compared to last year. So maybe the reality is that 70-90% of the people who did buy into this game went digital, like myself. I mean, the Steam all-time peak player count for SCVI is already higher than SFV, so...there's that."

"I don't think trying to attend to the breath while doing something else is a good idea. If I'm performing a task, then my attention needs to be on the task. If I try to keep my attention on the breath at the same time then my attention will alternate, which is something that happens normally but meditation is supposed to temporarily reduce and eventually eliminate it. So it seems that purposefully strengthening the habit of having alternating attention would be counterproductive. It would also reduce task performance, with possible consequences ranging from annoying to deadly (depending on whether I'm washing the dishes or driving a car).

I think it's better to just do whatever you're doing and intend to maintain introspective awareness throughout the day as best as you can. And if you're doing something monotonous that would normally lead to spacing out, you can try making it into meditation with the activity as the object."

"Hey there, it sounds like your players were lacking some kind of motivation to act. Perhaps you hadn't found a way to 'hook' them into an adventure yet, or they really are the passive 'audience member/spectator' type of players: people who want cool stuff to happen, and to just go along for the ride. It sucks that the one player doesn't want to play anymore. He may find a better experience at another campaign, or he may rejoin yours at some point.
Right now, you are running the campaign for the remaining players, so focus on them. 

You may get somewhere by... well, shaking things up a bit. Make things happen to the environment they're in, or to them, which they almost have to react to:

* The town they're in is invaded by a neighboring kingdom, and the guards either fight to the death or flee... what will happen to the prisoners? Do the PC's want to join up with the new pillaging horde as mercenaries, reaping the loot of the kingdom's villages and fighting the 'noble'  nights of the region? 
* The captain of the guard offers the condemned prisoners a Suicide Squad type pact, allowing them to escape the gallows so long as they perform a deadly task. A high-ish level cleric can put them under a Geas spell to comply, or die (suffer extreme psychic damage) in x days.
* The PCs break their buddy out of jail, but their faces are known. They'll have to lie low, at least for a while, but their possessions and wealth have largely been impounded. They'll have to venture out to a dungeon somewhere to gain new treasure, or perhaps break in to the guardhouse and reclaim what's theirs.

Also, here's some fairly 'expert' advice, specific to running Evil campaigns:

[Running an evil campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFBKCvD5D3o)

Start this one at 15 mins or so: [on being an evil character](https://youtu.be/kVuF4fkRD2c?t=917)


Anyways, all that being said, your question was about how to see this coming, and how to avoid it. Honestly, a lot of that is just adhering to the above: make sure they have a common goal, something that motivates all of them to work together. It's especially hard in evil campaigns, i've been a player in one where the DM did not know how to give the players a reason to work together, and it took a bit work to get some of my other friends at the table to join up with the party... they had some thoughts on their own motivations, and they didn't match up with the story the DM was trying to tell. 

That sucks, but... well, the player shave to meet you half way. If they create a character that cares about nothing, and doesn't want to adventure, just being selfish, what are you supposed to do? Talk with your players about what they want, specifically, what their characters actually want - motivations and goals. Not every campaign story works for every character, so be willing to adapt your story... or dont allow certain (types of) characters."

Mm... close. A little thinner but close. 
"Apologies for the late post - lines were all available at time of posting. Some of my thoughts:

Minnesota - this is a huge number to me. I had these teams about even in the preseason. VanVleet out for Toronto I think matters. If you look at Toronto's best lineups from last season almost all of them included him. On the flip side I think the Wiggins injury is actually beneficial for Minnesota. Tiny sample size but the wolves are 15 pts/100 poss better defensively without him this season (approx 400 possessions on and off for comparison). He has consistently been a negative player in terms of BPM and net rating.

Miami - My numbers have this closer to 10. I think there has been a little bit of an overreaction to how these teams have played so far this season (Knicks actually have a positive net rating on CtG). I think Miami dominates the glass and wins by double digits - I also think the extra couple of days off helps a little.

Chicago - Charlotte's positive net rating is a mirage - they have been well below league average in all of the 4 factors except for turnovers on both sides of the ball. Turnovers are carrying this team. My preseason numbers had Charlotte as a 1-2 point favorite and I think the market has overreacted.

Philadelphia - I understand the rest angle and that Milwaukee has been awesome, but 6 points is way too many. The fact that Griffin dropped 50, Philly shot poorly from 3, didn't have Simmons and still found a way to almost win the game was impressive to me. Getting Simmons back tonight is huge, and to me negates the back-to-back disadvantage a little bit, along with the fact that it is very early in the season - I'll take the points."

"Character I commissioned for a future ToA campaign.



Zelva has a thousand stories, though few of them are his own. Born on an island in the Cauldron Bay to the Tarat tribe, Zelva had an auspicious trait that sealed his fate among his people: Albinism. He was, from the moment of his birth, raised to become a Canvas. 



Albinos are seen to have a special connection to the Queen of Empty Shells, a god that looks over the transition from life to death. A bone-white Canvas represents the inevitability of death, but is also tasked with giving meaning to the lives of their tribesmen. When a Tarat tortle nears the end of its life, the Canvas is summoned. Their magic extends the lifespan of the tortle long enough for them to relay their life stories, which can last from hours to weeks. During this time the Canvas uses special inks and needles to inscribe their own skin. The first mark is made at the beginning of the story, and the last thing the dying see is the completed image: A whole life, thousands of words, distilled to a single tattoo on the Canvas. 



Zelva began this journey as a child: He was taught to listen deeply and seldom speak. He sought out exotic inks and dyes for his craft. He was a valuable and respected member of the community. Like death, he was not feared nor revered. He lived over 80 years of this quiet life. 



Ten years ago another Canvas named Kamol was born. Zelva was content that he would soon give his own story to his successor and pass to the Queen of Empty Shells. But in old age, Zelva is finding newfound vigor: His bones feel stronger, his eyes more alert than they have been in decades. With this comes a wanderlust unfamiliar to him or the rest of his tribe. These stories are bigger than the Tarats. They should be shared with the world.

The ongoing repressive violence that directly resulted from that right wing regime is what is now forcing many Hondurans to flee their beloved home for safety.

But what does the stochastic POS terrorist in the WH and his brain-dead cult of zombies do - hold out a helping hand?

"I have this monitor. First you need to know that the state of hdr on PC, while it has improved quote a bit from a year ago even, is still largely a mess. The seamless hdr experience you get from an Xbox x or PS4 pro just isn't present on PC.

On the PC side, some games have their own hdr settings where you can toggle it on and off in the in-game menu. Other games rely on the hdr setting within windows 10 itself. It's inconsistent between different games. That could be part of your problem.

So first, what games are you trying to play?

For example, Forza horizon 4 is a UWP ""app"" essentially, so it relies on the Windows 10 hdr being turned on in Windows display settings. Shadow of the tomb raider is the same. However, for assassin's Creed origins or Odyssey, you don't need to toggle hdr in Windows. These games have their own hdr setting in the game menu.

For scaling, 100% scaling would be native 1:1 4k signal. 4k on a 27"" panel is really small. Windows by default will scale to 150%, which is about what a 1440p signal would look like on a 27"" monitor. Note that this is just for desktop and other apps, games will ignore this scaling."

"I am by no means an expert on policing but if a suspect is running from a crime scene and a police men believes that they are a danger to any other person they have the right to use lethal force. In a sense it is better use a dog than a gun. If you don't want to get bitten, don't run. There's a reason cops tell you to stop. It's the suspects decision to run and it's their fault they get bitten.  However, I do see the point that police training is horrible and from my experience with the people who handle them. They are kept in nice homes with loving families. Most police dogs are just dogs trained to do a job and will act like a regular dog when they are in a safe environment. I'm not here to start anything but I just wanted to get some info out there."

As an example, when you moved Dalinar's flashbacks from book 5 to book 3, did you re-outlined book 3 narrative to make it a better match, or you already had both Dalinar's narratives for books 3 and 5 present day and merely decided where flashbacks play the best counterpoint to what Dalinar is doing in the main timeline?

2.Do you choose cover arts for your books yourself or you give your artist to choose. As for Oathbringer, why that particular moment with Jasnah was chosen? I like the cover, but I guess I wanted the see Dalinar , who would be more appropriate for this book."

Whether it was an extreme right terrorist, a false flag, or foreign interference, I think it benefits everyone of all political views to wake up and realize just because today it wasn't ""your guy"" responsible, there's no telling if it will be tomorrow. I personally think two of those are more probably than the other, but the fact that our inept presidents toxic attitude needs to be put in check doesn't change regardless of what was the true cause. Assigning blame to a political side before we identify the person responsible gets people defensive and we end up not figuring out whether we still have common ground or not."

"That's all fine but it seemed like you were saying that Mic researches his videos and his accomplishments were 'remarkable'

He rarely steps out of that comfort zone, but when he does he gets things so, so wrong. Ever see his video on vitamin A conversion? He tries to calculate how many carrots someone with beta-carotene-to-retinol impaired genes (69% impairment to conversion) needs to eat for reaching the RDA, so he just takes the daily value and reduces it by 69%. That math is wrong! You need to use the conversion rates for each particular food, from carrot to sweet potato to cantaloupe they are all different. The conversion for carrots is 15IU beta carotene to 1IU retinol. If you do the math right, you get \~4 cups of carrot vs his 1 cup. But his whole premise is flawed anyway, as RDA isn't meant to be conversion/bioavailability but just content in foods. So he set himself up to fail, and then did the math wrong as a bonus. Guess this is what happens when he doesn't wait for Greger to cover something accurately. "

"The point of the article was to explain that the way tests are worded and the way the answers were, reflected the white suburban middle class. This meant that the questions would be harder for people of poorer backgrounds to answer and stated that Latinx and Black people are at a default disadvantage. If the Asian narrative was added (where a large proportion are either poor or not) it would completely throw off the narrative that minorities are targeted by the test. Is it unfair? Yes.

"I would never consider my pet as a baby or call myself a mum to them and I do intend to have children one day. I love my cats because each one is different. They do not give unconditional love. They give love on the condition that it's on their terms and when they want to.

The most rewarding thing about cats is how intelligent they are and how they've learned things independently. One of my cats learned how to chew open a box of biscuits and use a paw to fish out one or two biscuits from the box they opened with a cupped paw. This method was then ""taught"" to my other cat.

The other cat learned to slide a hallway door by pressing a paw and pushing a few times until there was a gap big enough to push through. Previously he would try to push his head or paw through to open it or give up. 

I treasure the love they give me. It's so rewarding to be greeted with a hook in the tail and knowing they just want to be with me. That love isn't unconditional though. I've spent all their life caring for them. Feeding, cleaning, patting and spending time with them. That's what is rewarding, caring for them and giving them what they need. I've spent their whole life trying to understand some of their behaviour so I know when to and not to approach them and gain their trust. "
"Cool! I love how God opens our understanding of the Bible as we walk in faith with Him. 

OP, also remember that the full meaning of Revelation has been sealed to the understanding of humanity until an appointed time, if I am correct in remembering this - it has been a while since I studied it. So while we may be given partial understanding, if the time hasn‚Äôt come yet, then we just won‚Äôt know until we know, if you get my meaning. 

I also think that Jesus gives us the best take home message about Revelation, that is, when we start to see the prophecies come to pass, we should take it as a sign that His return is near. Therefore, we should take hope in what we observe in the world, rather than feeling doomed."

"The fact that the Imperium yet stands is a victory against the vile agressors be they ancient as necron or eldar, primal as chaos or ork, or ideological as tau and rebels. Every moment Terra stands in her whole glory it is a show of mankind's spirit in persevering over all the evil the universe wishes to throw upon it."
That's not what happening here.. Just a messed up indicator. Besides external blocking regulates any attacks outside who you're targeting to one angle so cross ups aka soft feints would do nothing unless they come from who you're locked on to. So again an indicator bug is not a cross up.

"He was a good receiver with us for two years. Had good hands and always seemed to be getting open on deep routes even though he wasn‚Äôt very fast. Ran decent routes and made some contested catches. Probably the best receiver we had in awhile but that‚Äôs not saying much considering how horrible our receivers have been throughout the years. Seemed like a good mentor for our younger receivers. He always thought people were out to get him. Though he never exhibited his ‚Äúme first and screw everybody else‚Äù diva attitude until this year it seems like. He got hurt and had to have surgery, if I‚Äôm remembering correctly. After he came back, he looked overweight, slower than ever, couldn‚Äôt get open on his routes, or catch any balls thrown his way. We weren‚Äôt playing him much because we wanted him to learn the playback and bring him into a first year offense slowly due to his injury. When he wasn‚Äôt playing or getting thrown the ball, he grew impatient and asked to be released, despite negotiating a new contract without an agent a couple months prior. 

TLDR: was a good, reliable receiver for us. Then he wasn‚Äôt good anymore and unleashed his A+ diva attitude and asked to be released so we cut ties with him. 

My prediction for you guys: he‚Äôs washed up and unless he‚Äôs thrown the ball at least 10 times a game, he will whine and complain even though he‚Äôs dropping balls and is nowhere near open.  "

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The idea is that there are lots of weird ways that accountants can fiddle with expenses to make a company look profitable by not recognizing expenses now but instead push them out into the future. This makes sense if you are buying a machine for big money now that will be used to make a lot of stuff in the future but companies have taken it too far in the past so now there are generally accepted principles for when and how to recognize revenue and costs. And in this case Tesla is emphasizing it to show that they aren't playing any tricks to push expenses from today out into the future to make things seem better than they are.

"I disagree. They are not the same and order does matter. 

1 | 1 1 -5 3 produces the auxiliary eq'n r^(2) + 2r -3 and factoring produces (r+3)(r-1) = 0. Synthetically dividing again,  -3| 1 2 -3, we get (r-1) = 0. So, ""combining the zeros"" gives us (r+3)(r-1)(r-1) = 0.  These are the correct zeros and multiplicity. 

However, if I choose the order of -3| 1 1 -5 3 the resulting auxiliary eq'n is r^(2) -2r + 1 and factoring it results in (r-1)(r-1) = 0. Synthetically dividing again,  1| 1 -2 1, we get (r-1) = 0. So, ""combining the zeros"" gives us (r-1)(r-1)(r-1) = 0.  However, these are not the correct zeros.

"Like...Do people -read-? OP says in OP that the girlfriend has BFA. So here is what used to be - I cannot attest to any current situation: Say for example I have a (and I did mind you) an Alliance character that has exalted highmountain rep...I then create a CLASS trial on the horde side (Did mine with orge cause hearth is set to main city) - Get in - Hearth...go Talk to Syl - Pick up quest and unlock the allied race.

&amp;#x200B;

Only thing I can think of is for the lightforged make sure she has the Exalted Rep and -all- of the required achievements/story plots done - She may have to do them on the class trial character as these quests are not tied into the war campaign quests for BFA

"It‚Äôs been exactly a week since I got PRK. Had my bandage contacts removed yesterday. Aside from suffering from blurry/ghosting vision still (to be expected), this morning I woke up with super dry eyes especially my left eye. Had to fumble around to get my preservative-free drops and while I was trying to drip some into my left eye, I missed which caused me to blink real hard as a reflex. That hard blink brought back a familiar sensation of shooting pain- that dry drag. It reminded me a lot of my 2nd day post PRK pain whenever I tried to sleep but would always get woken up by the same shooting pain every half an hour from dry eyes. Doc did say yesterday that my eyes would feel a little gritty after removing the contacts but I didn‚Äôt expect things to be this bad. Thanks to what happened this morning, now my eyes feel even more scratchy. Felt like the dry friction of my eyelids blinking probably scratched off some of the healing epithelial cells. Are you experiencing any dryness/pain anywhere close to this? I‚Äôm getting a little concerned if this is what I may possibly have to deal with for the rest of my life- the cycle of waking up every morning with dry eyes, some healing eye cells get scratched off, and nothing ever fully heals."

"I do understand that some people are obligate carnivores beacuse of genetic mutations. This is one thing that vegans need to grasp (I'm not vegan, btw. I love me some meats). 

But to say that humans are carnivores on a species-wide level seems disingenuous, imo (not saying you said that, but it's a common theme in this sub). The vast majority of people can survive solely on plant foods for a long time. That puts us well out of carnivore territory and firmly into omnivore territory. Omnivores can already eat meat should they come across it, so there is no need, imo, to evoke the 'carnivore' label at all. It's already covered. 

Cats are carnivores because they cannot survive on plant foods...at all. The same cannot be said for humans at the species level. Organ meats are the best source of several nutrients, imo, but most people can synthesize vitamins from precursors found in plant foods if they have to. It's that kind of metabolic flexibility that makes us omnivores. 

&gt; After I‚Äôve seen dozens and dozens of people successfully eating zerocarb for years and feeling and functioning the best they‚Äôve ever had, not to mention solving severe diseases that were supposed to be incurable... Well, to me that left a pretty strong impression. Convincing enough to try it for myself and at least be certain that I‚Äôm not going to die or do any irreparable damage from lack of vegetables or vitamin deficiencies in just a few months, but those several months could be enough to see if it works or not.

They are doing an elimination diet. If they were eating something plant-based that was causing them irritation and/or a chronic condition, of course eliminating all plant foods would help them resolve it. But that doesn't mean that all plant foods are bad. They could also just start reintroducing some foods up to the point where they become symptomatic again. 
Eventually they would know which type of plant food is causing them harm. 


&gt;zerocarb

My fear with zerocarb over the long term is gut health. It's pretty clear, imo, that we're supposed to consume at least some fiber. My concern with zerocarb over the long term is that it will increase the risk of colon cancer. Fiber helps push things along by providing more surface area for gnarly things to cling to. There are things in there (including potential carcinogens from cooked plants and animals) that you don't want clinging to the inner lining of your intestines for a long time. 

I suspect that a very low fiber diet allows things to do just that. 

One great reason to use soap is that it breaks the bond between microbes and your skin, allowing the soap to carry them away. The same principle applies here. The intestinal wall is a vast (from a microbe or a molecule's perspective) 3D surface that they are happy to cling to. Water or soft stool passing by isn't really going to do much.

"That is not true.  If I remember correctly it was suggested by Fallon that it would become part of an amended agreement that they would have, but that was prior to judge AS‚Äôs original dismissal.

Of course we found out later Fallon tried to warn AS about the impending amendment, tipping her off so she could hurry up and rule on the original brief.  

KZ new he would do that and so she sent AS a letter first, post marked it before Fallon  got his out.

On some level sure your argument is similar but the major difference is generally Mario games are not miniature raves. nor do they have same non consistent map design, or require loot to do everything, Mario if you miss a coin it won't slow you down much and you could go back for it later if you really need it.

I don't find picking up resources or mods in warframe fun, simply because I need so much of it and they are all just pretty nondescript laying on the floor.

Minimum wage ensures all the basic necessities and then some.

If you're trying to live like the ""1%"" on minimum wage, you're living far outside your means.  That means, no, you can't afford a 67'000 dollar truck (3x your yearly income after tax); yet for some reason, many people think it's possible.

&gt; A Saudi airstrike has claimed the lives of at least 20 Yemeni civilians and 10 others sustained injuries in province of Hudaydah as the regime in Riyadh continues its atrocious campaign against its crisis-hit southern neighbor.

&gt; According to Yemen&amp;#039;s al-Masirah television network, the casualties were caused after Saudi warplanes targeted a group of farmers in a vegetables market in Masoudi area of Bayt al-Faqih district of the western province on Wednesday.

&gt; On October 13, the Saudi planes targeted two buses that were carrying civilians fleeing the port city of Hudaydah, killing at least 17 civilians and wounding 20 others.

The reason shotguns are used so much is largely due to the fact that the maps are designed with so much short range sightlines and cover within 10 or so meters of an objective.  

Look at Gambit, shotguns are run way less there, because the maps are more open and sightlines are way longer.  "

You know that Trudeau may as well respond with,

&gt; *The non-existant Ford tax on pollution will force more Canadian babies to die of cancer, it will ensure our seniors die more often in the streets from black lung and that our children grow up to live in an unviable and desolate wasteland of a better Canada.*

I hate politician who use intense hyperbole to win ""hearts and minds"".

The warranty is worth it for me. Having a used car is difficult when something goes wrong and you have to end up at the mechanic time after time. The cost really adds up if it‚Äôs $200 here and there. Also living in a new city I don‚Äôt have anyone to rely on if my car breaks down.

"I've lived a promiscuous life. I think casual sex has given me a breadth of experiences while committed sex has given me a depth of experience. I value them both for different reasons and wouldn't want to erase one or the other if I had a time machine as they've both contributed to who I am today and both have had good and bad times involved.

I think the most important thing is to try your best to find partners who respect you both in what you do and don't want to do sexually - not everyone will like the same things as you in bed, but they shouldn't put you down for your likes. They also shouldn't pressure you into doing something if you're hesitant. Use protection, condoms are way more comfortable than pregnancy and several STDs, I promise you, and you can quote me on that if anyone (or your own brain) tries to tell you it'll feel better without one.

Most importantly, you don't owe anyone sex. If you're naked and right about to smoosh bodies together and they say or do something that makes you really uncomfortable, get up and put your clothes on and end the encounter. There's no point in sex where you are obligated to trudge through it instead of backing out. You can stop bad sex right in the middle of it and leave if they aren't listening to you and taking your feedback into account. They'll get over it. It doesn't make you a bad person to leave them horny and wanting more if they can't show you respect during sex.

For that matter, as a general rule I wouldn't have sex with someone I'm not comfortable saying no to. It's more likely to end in hurt feelings or even physical damage if you're too worried about hurting their feelings or pissing them off to say ""I'm not feeling into that tonight."""

"&gt;  If you buy 2 sets of numbers, you still have better odds of winning

That's true. But it's so statistically negligible that it hardly even matters, even though intuitively everybody feels like it does. If I said somebody in America holds a combination to a safe that contains 1.5 billion dollars, and all you have to do is guess the right man, woman or child who has it, do you really think that two guesses are really that much better than one?

&gt; That guy that spent $6,000+ on the MM, he could have very well had hit the jackpot, he didn't, but it could have been his day. 

Again, intuitively it may feel that that's the case. But ask any actuary if the guy's odds were much better than the guy who only bought only 1 ticket, and he'll tell you that statistically they had an almost equal chance of being losers when it came to the main jackpot. 

&gt;  So whether you buy 1 or 1,000 tickets, nobody should be criticizing that because in the end it doesn't even matter.

It doesn't matter if you have the disposable income, and you understand that it's not helping your odds practically at all. If it's fun for you and you can afford it, then do it. "

"Have you used the Steam VR performance overlay to see what's happening?  It's under the graphics tab.  Click on Advanced Frame Timing.  A window will pop up showing your CPU and GPU performance.  Pull the slider all the way to 2000 frames and then check ""show in headset"".  Now the performance graph should be visible on your right hand (it's one dimensional so rotate it if you don't see it).

See if you're getting any reprojection/late starts (red on graph, and line above the 12 ms mark).  If you're seeing stuff in the top half then it's the CPU that's struggling.  If it's down below it's the GPU, or a combination of both if you also see problems in the top half.

The thing about AMD cards is they have terrible performance in UE4 games.  I blame Epic for crap optimization, rather than AMD, but regardless it's a big problem because a lot of VR games are UE4 (Budget Cuts isn't one of them, so that isn't specifically why it's running bad).  So, unfortunately Nvidia cards are really a more reliable choice for VR.  I started out using a Fury, but I had to switch to Nvidia due to bad performance in some games.  For those reasons a Vega 56 may not be the best choice, although it will be fine in most non-UE4 games.  

Someone created an application to send the graphics output from an Nvidia card to an AMD card to enable Freesync, so if you do buy an Nvidia card you could hold on to your RX480 and use it that way.  Kind of a clunky work around of course.  [https://github.com/pinumbernumber/SetGPU](https://github.com/pinumbernumber/SetGPU)"

"&gt; randomly 

This isn't random. It was telegraphed throughout the story.

In literary terms, it is a fairly direct example of what Joseph Campbell called [""apotheosis""](http://changingminds.org/disciplines/storytelling/plots/hero_journey/apotheosis.htm) - or the moment in a story when a character overcomes tragedy and trauma to unlock their full creative/destructive power. Diana is a great example of what Campbell was talking about because - as Zeus' secret daughter - she's literally discovering her divine potential and true identity as a goddess. *Lots* of super hero movies resolve around these moments.

"As a seasoned painter:

* Make sure to use primer specifically designed for miniatures. Often I find paint primer like krylon has a tendency to go on super thick and you lose a lot of detail on your models.

* As with all things, make sure your primer coat is thin. Don't hose down the mini but also make sure you get enough coverage on the model to prime the whole thing. My suggestion is to hold the model on a box or something else about a foot away from the nozzle of the primer and spray the model in short bursts on each side. So, spray, spray, spray, rotate, repeat until model is covered.

* I would recommend the Citadel Paint app as that will allow you to look up what color you want to paint your models and it will break down specifically what paints in the Citadel paint line to use. This makes it super easy to know what to go out and pick up from your LGS.

* Get yourself a decent selection of brushes. At bare minimum, snag a detail and basecoat brush as those will be doing your heavy lifting, painting-wise. As a newer painter, you may wanna just get yourself some cheaper brushes. I find that Army Painter makes solid beginner brushes that are relatively inexpensive. Just keep the paint out of the ferrule and keep the bristles clean and they'll last you a while.

* I am a huge fan of the [Silicoil Brush Cleaning Tank](https://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newton-Silicoil-Brush-Cleaning/dp/B0027ACEI2) for keeping your brushes paint-free as using a cup or bowl will have too many flat surfaces and cause you to splay your bristles too much while trying to get paint off of your brush.

* I mentioned this earlier but it bears repeating: *keep your paint thinned*. Acrylic paint is water-based so you can thin your paints before applying them to the mini with water and you always want to do that as thick paint on a mini will always look rough and have brush streaks in it when it dries. My recommendation is to go out and get a gallon of distilled water and an eye dropper so you can add water directly to the paint pots.

Hope that helps! Hit me up if you have any other questions!"

"Well what kinds of things would threaten the livelihood or happiness of members of a university of magic. Did they previously have a lot of political clout within their country because they provided warmages and now technology like say siege weapons make it easier and less expensive than they are? Are their egos' threatened by a ruler that looks more to the religious leaders of the realm for advice? Are they having their students stolen away by a rival university? Are the professors being afflicted by some degenerative disease that they can find no solution for? Think about life. What kind of things can happen that upset the balance in your life that you might turn to extraordinary means to solve. 

Then from there think what lengths would a person go to in order to save themselves. Do they have families that rely on them for money or are they driven by ego? What ties to others can your druid pull on that would bring these guys into following him? Money, power, saving your family, blackmail? It might be different for different people and maybe someone who is being blackmailed into submission can be persuaded to help the party versus someone driven purely by power needs to just be captured/killed."

"&gt;  There is usually a 3 year change over period where people get issued the new uniform while the old uniform is phased out.

Or longer.  The British military started phasing in their current ""MTP"" uniform back in late 2008, with the official ""change-over"" point being some time in 2012.  However, some units didn't get rid of their last '95 pattern (i.e. Woodland DPM) uniforms until the back end of 2016! That's 8 years to do a full change over and that isn't including individuals who still used their old stuff in situations where rules weren't so tightly enforced (training exercises or working away from their unit etc).
Hell, the MTP stuff was being experimented with even back in 2005, with a lot of a transitional uniform being brought in, which was the old '95 pattern uniform but in the new MTP cloth and colours that was also authorised to be worn side by side with either the old '95 or the newer MTP.

It's possible that the whole early ds9/Voyager uniform was actually just a variant that was being experimented with, which eventually lead to the TNG film/late ds9 uniform."

"I'd always been curious about sharing my wife with someone. She was open to the idea so we posted on a singers website. We chatted to a guy and arranged for him to come to our house one afternoon. After some chat he popped to the toilet, I checked if she was happy, she wanted to go ahead, so she went to get ready. She came back a few minutes later in a corset and suspenders ready for both of us. I struggled to get hard due to nerves, so proceeded to watch them fuck for hours. Hottest part was when she ordered me to fetch the lube, then climbed on top and rode him anally. I loved going to the toilet and hearing them fuck together without me. When done I saw him out and thanked him, then reclaimed her on the sofa. I knew then it was the lifestyle for me. "

"Oh, my, you've really bought into the talking points, haven't you?"
"I can understand what you're saying, but I disagree. I think in a perfect world where everyone is equal, and with no racism, sexism, or discrimination, people wouldn't feel the need to have parades because they're already being treated the way they want to -- like everyone else. Women used to march on Washington for the right to vote, but once they gained that right, the marches for voting rights stopped for obvious reasons.

But the problem is, there still *is* discrimination, sexism, and racism, and I've been on this Earth long enough to know that these problems don't fix themselves just by pretending they don't exist. So, in the meantime, in my opinion it is important for these people to become more visible. 

Additionally, from personal experience (I myself am gay), it can be lonely and isolating especially during your teenage years when you may not know many gay other people. Seeing pride parades happening all over the country in the summertime was one of the things that helped me feel less alone. 

&gt;the more we fixate on it.. the more we feed into the perception of ""differences"".. and the further we get away from ""equality"".

This is simply untrue. LGBTQ+ people have gained *so* much ground over the past few decades (both legally and in the realm of public opinion), and probably the biggest reason for that is their increased visibility in our culture.  Tim Cook himself said that young gay people look up to him, especially now that he's out.  Finally, I don't personally buy into the idea that getting rid of a perception of ""differences"" will make things better. Some people have dark skin, and some people have light skin, and no matter how much you say you're ""colorblind,"" you know damn well what color skin someone has. The problem isn't that we perceive differences, the problem is that we see these differences and *then* proceed to prejudice people based on those differences. As Tim Cook says, I'm proud to be gay, and I don't want you to have to just blindly forget about that part of me in order to see me on the same level as you. I want you to see me as a gay person, accept that's part of my identity, and continue to see me on the same level as you.

Does that all make sense?

"If a women gets pregnant, and she doesn't want it, she can put the child up for adoption. I am a strong believer as well that there should be increased programs for single mothers, especially those who had unexpected pregnancies, so that they can support and raise their child if need be.

If a woman has consensual sex, and she gets pregnant from said consensual sex, that is a direct result of her choice. That action has a consequence, and the consequence is pregnancy and eventual childbirth. Of course, men ought to have skin in the game too, and should be on the hook for financial support. The whole thing gets a lot easier when sex is kept inside of marriage, which helps to provide the child with two loving parents, but I understand that not everyone does that."

"I was referring to Mono's support of running .NET Framework *.exe files as-is and not Mono as a whole.  

&gt;  products like Unity.

Unity or Xamarin do not really use Mono for emulating .NET Framework or for console apps. They use it as a .NET runtime that runs on devices that .NET Core does not run on.   




&gt; except it's not unsupported and unpopular?

With .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Core, there is literally no reason to use either .NET Framework or Mono for cross platform console applications in 2018. 

Mono is already losing popularity on platforms where .NET Core is supported and .NET Framework will lose popularity as soon as .NET Core 3 matures, hence unpopular.  
Unsupported because Mono documentation is mostly outdated and .NET Core has replaced it for console apps on Linux. Mono can run .NET Core apps and that'll probably become more popular for the rare non-desktop platforms that .NET Core doesn't support.  

And as another commenter pointed out, it does not work well with non-trivial applications.

"Mexico officials became concerned about attitudes among the Anglo-Americans in Tejas, for instance their insistence on bringing slaves into the territory. The legislature passed the Law of April 6, 1830 that prohibited further immigration by U.S. citizens. The government established several new presidios in the region to monitor immigration and customs practices. Angry colonists held a convention in 1832 to demand that U.S. citizens be allowed to immigrate to Tejas. At a convention the following year, colonists proposed that Texas become a separate Mexican state. Although Mexico implemented several measures to appease the colonists, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's measures to transform Mexico from a federalist to a centralist state appeared to be the catalyst for the Anglo-Texan colonists to revolt.

The first violent incident occurred on June 26, 1832, at the Battle of Velasco. On March 2, 1836, Texians declared their independence from Mexico. The Texas Revolution ended on April 21, 1836, when Santa Anna was taken prisoner by Texians following the Battle of San Jacinto. Although Texas declared its independence as the Republic of Texas, Mexico refused to recognize it.

&gt; U.S. spy agencies have determined that Russia and China are eavesdropping on &amp;#039;s personal phone calls in order to gain information that they can use to influence American policy, according to a New York Times report.

&gt; Two of those people who Beijing has identified as frequent Trump contacts are Stephen Schwartzman and Steve Wynn, businessmen and friends who Trump speaks with regularly, the Times reported.

Most guys are towards the middle, and most guys do just fine with women. I only think when you start getting too far to the end of the spectrum, it might cause problems. 


Even the guy that I mentioned who deepened his voice, when he showed the sample of his before voice, yes, it was higher pitched, but he actually had a really nice voice, it was kind of smooth and soothing and seductive, lol, so I don't even know why he thought his voice was so bad.

"Typically getting towers is always better if the players know what to do after securing the tower. They have to move around the map and catch waves.

When I watch lower elo players play after getting an early tower...they usually continue laning or they ARAM. If bottom gets their tower in under 8 minutes they either keep returning to lane or they ARAM with their mid laner. This creates several problems: 

* Bottom lanes waves don't get manage it they ARAM

* If they keep laning they over push and are killed by the enemy collapsing, losing their lead

* They are sharing XP and gold with their mid laner

* They are letting the enemy catch up with XP and gold

Basically, if the laners don't know what to do after taking a very early tower, they can inadvertently put their teammates behind via grouping. Better players know to get the dragon, lane swap, rotate to the lower HP tower, secure rift etc. However, when I see silver players take a tower at 7 or 8 minutes...they usually don't do any of those things and then they fall behind from sharing XP and CS. They also don't pressure the other lanes. In these instances continuing to lane until ALL the towers are ripe to take might be better than taking a tower at 6 minutes or something."

"&gt; No new talent row/capstone ability at max level.

That is part of the reason I didn't go back. I left Legion during 7.3 for FFXIV because I was bored.

I thought about going back for the expansion, but noticed that one of the major classes I played (Ele Shaman) was crap and there was nothing that really changed your play style as you levelled. At least in Legion you had the artifact traits which affected your play as you unlocked them. Only a handful of the Azerite traits seem to do that.

That's even aside from the whole RNG gear system."
"A scheduled network upgrade that caused an hour+ (iirc) of downtime. You can check the do status page for each data center to see how often they have problems like that. 

The performance of their storage solution, Spaces, was inconsistent and sometimes horrible. Replaced it with azure which was OK but not quite. Finally went to S3 which has been the best. But that‚Äôs how bad spaces is - I can get my data from NYC3 to amazon in NoVA faster than DO can get it to a disk in the same data center. 

Their load balancer solution has a let‚Äôs encrypt support built-in (nice!).  For some reason it failed to renew my certificate. I got exactly one email notification about it a month ago which I missed. Their system does not attempt to notify you again as the expiration gets closer (fail!)

My certificate expired last weekend and my site effectively was down. It took over 8 hours for their support to even respond, but only after I called them out on Twitter (the only way to get a half way fast response by the way). 

Support was never able to determine why my certificate wouldn‚Äôt renew or why I can‚Äôt even create a new certificate (still no follow up from them after almost a week).  

I ended up just buying a certificate when they still hadn‚Äôt fixed it 9 hours after I opened the ticket and I won‚Äôt be relying on their let‚Äôs encrypt feature anymore. 

A smaller issue - their droplets are far from standardized. You may buy a certain size droplet with the impression you‚Äôre getting a certain size box, but the underlying hardware could be vastly different. 

I had one node in my cluster that I noticed had much higher error rates and one day it just crashed. It turns out that it had a very small amount of cache ~~on the motherboard~~ compared to the others. I had to destroy it and get a new one which luckily looked ok, and has worked much better 

Tl;dr flaky, half-baked and unreliable with horrible support. However, very easy to use when things work, and cheap. 

They do purport to have better quality support available  but only if your monthly spend is over $500/mo which is way more than I currently need. 

Edit: commenters reminded me that L3 cache hasn‚Äôt been located directly on the motherboard since c. 1999"

I want to believe 'people' have been breeding them to have more elongated snouts.  But when people tote around and brag about being an AKC approved breeder, all I see is that fucked up little disaster that the AKC proudly displays 'as the standard' for the breed.

Somehow, I got a burst of inspiration last night for one of my fanfics, which I haven't updated since January. But I started to write from four-year-old Harry Potter's POV, and while I sort of know how kids that age act, since I worked at a preschool, writing from the actual point of view of a 4 year old is really challenging. Usually in that fic, I just write Bucky/the Winter Soldier's POV.

Results:

- A bit of redness especially after applying the toner pero nawawala din in a few minutes.
- The toner stings for a few mins as well! Is it normal?
- I have a few tiny pinkish pimples that grew around my cheeks, which I don‚Äôt even break out there normally, it‚Äôs toooo tiny so kebs lang. Also, ganun ba talaga lumabas pimples on the first week?

"It's a little painful to see another thread like this when there is a overflowing bounty of useful information that can help you, but here we are.

That said, here is how I've learned to improve my game.  

1:  Watch pro matches.  A lot of them.  And just pay attention to when they push, when they rotate, what angles to they hold, call outs, etc.  

2:   Play training maps.  I can't stress this enough.  On a daily basis I do the aimbotz 1minute 90 degree challenge and log my score for the m4, and the ak.  Daily, I do the betway challenge with the ak and m4 and log my times.  Daily, I do black bar training to make sure the muscle memory for headshots is never leaving me.  Weekly I pick a map and do peek training via the workshop.  ANd I'm just now going to start adding smoke training to all of this.  Personally, I think the peek training maps are so crucial. It will teach you meta in a way you will not get anywhere outside of watching pro matches, but you have your hands on it.  My total daily commitment to training can be rushed through at like 20 minutes.  But since I'm unemployed I'm spending an hour or two every single day to train and train alone. I also spend a lot of time doing 128 tick pistols only DM.  Only using usp and glock.  But now that I have those down to where I feel super competent with them I'm moving on to other pistols like the 250, 5.7, Tec9, etc.   

Also, I stay the fuck away from stuff like arms race and deathmatch.  I find it makes me sloppy when I go back to casual and MM.  And I do play a lot of casual even though it's a mixed bag with lobbies.  Lot of hackers, lot of garbage, no real team play, but I have a core of friends that we all use it to practice for MM and it works out.

Hopefully this helps."

Just a note on this--you said that Tyler can understand the code. Is there something that implies that? I feel as though referencing ones and zeroes could imply that he doesn't. If he's morphed into someone else, he could be stepping away from himself and looking at the information in his mind from a distance. Since he's not using the same operating system, so to speak, he could be struggling to make sense of the things in his mind, only seeing ones and zeroes. 

People with depression sometimes describe a feeling of losing themselves, and it could be a reference to that. Of course, I'm sure there's likely a deeper meaning behind his intent of using that metaphor to connect to the bigger picture."

"This makes sense to me.  I guess ""failover"" isn't the proper term I should have used.  ""Forwarder"" would be the correct one, in that I want a dual-layered system.  In that system I want to be able to resolve local hosts, and I want to block unwanted domains.  I guess it doesn't matter either way.  Both routes will eventually lead to a local resolve, and blocked domains from the pihole.  The only thing that separates the two for me is I haven't used pihole yet, and am wondering if it's easier to setup my bind server to point to the pihole as a forward vs the other way around.  

Edit: After reading the article posted by /u/Connir, I think I might actually opt for your route.  If a client on the internal network asks for a unwanted domain resolve, the bind DNS server is going to try and cache the result that comes back from the upstream DNS server.  If I added a pihole upstream as the next DNS server to forward to, the pihole will block it, and the bind server would be ""confused"" as to why it couldn't cache the result(?).   If I were to add a pihole in between the clients and the bind instance and use it as a forwarding DNS server, the pihole won't even attempt to cache the bad domain, and the bind server can perform the upstream recursive resolving.

&gt; U.S. spy agencies have determined that Russia and China are eavesdropping on &amp;#039;s personal phone calls in order to gain information that they can use to influence American policy, according to a New York Times report.

&gt; Two of those people who Beijing has identified as frequent Trump contacts are Stephen Schwartzman and Steve Wynn, businessmen and friends who Trump speaks with regularly, the Times reported.

&gt; Trump aides told the Times that they hope he does not share confidential information during those phone calls with friends, due to Chinese and Russian spies likely listening in.

"&gt;That's the point. You gotta fight for democracy.

WTF does that even mean in this context? How is democracy going change who owns private property? By voting for a government big and powerful enough to steal it? I've got news for you sunshine: Once a government gets that big and powerful, YOU most certainly aren't the one who's going to be reaping the profits of the stolen goods. That's how you wind up with the Soviet Union.

&gt;Oh so Bezos built his warehouses?

No, he built up his business big enough to pay other people who agreed to build the warehouses in exchange for an agreed upon amount of money. Welcome to how the world works. It's like talking to a 3 year old; even the simplest concepts are wondrous!

&gt;But now he is massively exploiting his workers to the point of needing an ambulance parked outside warehouses. 

Nobody is forcing anybody to work at Amazon. Unemployment is at an all time low and there are several times more job openings than people to fill them. If they were really that unhappy, they would quit and find a different job.

&gt;The two worst? US capitalism alone has resulted in 200 million deaths in just a century. 

Define ""resulted in"". Is the government breaking down their door and shooting them in the head because they dared to question the country's leaders? I think we can agree that is a death that came as a result of the political system. Or, is the government simply failing to provide certain protections/regulations that likely would have prevented the death of a particular person *by a third party*? Capitalist governments of past did not kill people, they just happened to be in power while people died in workplace accidents or poverty. That is a massive, massive difference that your idiotic article doesn't acknowledge. People die that way in every political system.

Oh, and it counts war too? Yes, we all know that war is strictly a capitalist construct right? Jesus fucking Christ.

&gt;Theres also the 80 million Fascism killed in just 6 years.

...Wtf does that have to do with anything?

"I think what you're missing here is that in cases like Tropic Thunder Robert Downey Jr isn't actually playing a black character, he's playing a method actor who believes it to be acceptable to do blackface and play a role on stereotypes. If anything the humour here is from how offensive blackface really is.

It would 110% be offensive if he was simply playing a black character.

In regards to the OP  with things such as halloween costumes - these kinds of things will definitely not be treated with the level of nuance in Tropic Thunder. It's not an incredible stretch of the imagination to see how people blacked up playing black characters offensively as 'just a joke' can be deeply reminiscent of blackface, and how it's simply disregarding the personhood of black people in the context of modern racial society.

It's purely a cost issue. A carbon sequestration device must be built in a factory. A tree builds itself by you sticking a seed in the ground.

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

If you want black to be shiny like those other letters underbase it with a grey. Underbasing a black causes it to be glossy rather than the matte sunken into shirt look.

"I don't think that the attachment is the same regardless of what they look like.

The dynamic is entirely different, you're a human talking to a human, or a human talking to a robot which mimics certain human traits but not all and fundamentally isn't human. The characters are of course written with this in mind, interactions with the various Mr Handys in fo4 are very different to the interactions with humans for example, and our relationships with them are different as a result. 

You're saying it doesn't matter who or what npcs are or what they look like, the fact that they are there is enough and you will grow attached to them or not regardless, but I just don't think that's true.

"&gt; Can someone explain to me why I should vote for proportional? I'd like someone to change my mind.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) explains the problems with First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) system, our current system.

**Summary:**

* **Minority Rule**: A candidate representing 20% of the population could win while the other 80% get no representation. Could be worse a % ratio with more candidate running.
* **Two-Party system**: Given enough time FPTP will unavoidably lead to a Two-Party system, both of which could be the minority of the actual population as stated above
* **FPTP is susceptible to Gerrymandering**: Voters are divided up to blocks to vote, whoever draws up the lines can manipulate who wins
* **Spoiler effect**: Since FPTP leads to a Two-Party system, a 3rd party will take votes away from one of the Two-Parties who they are most similar with, thus only causing the other of the Two-Parties to win. Therefore once in a Two-Party system it's very difficult to get out of such.

Additional problems with FPTP:

* **Forces people to vote strategically**: People don't vote for who they really want, they vote against who they don't want if their preference is not one of the Two-Parties.
* **Voter votes are ""wasted""**: if not voting for one of the Two-Parties, they didn't actually get a say because their 3rd party wasn't really a contender. Some PR systems allow less wasted votes because candidates are ranked, so non-contenders are eliminated as if they never ran and their voters actually get a say on which of the two-parties they prefer due to ranked voting.

Typically Proportional Representation systems minimizes or eliminates the above many problems with FPTP.

"Mack's are washable in some way. The silicon putty should be washable, provided you don't destroy it by abrasion or tearing it apart.

No such thing as permanent foam earplugs (anecdote). But if I were you, pick the pack of earplugs from them and alternate as much as possible, one for a readily available dry earplug and another that you just cleaned, waiting for drying. You can wash it but do not use soap. Soap is bad for foams most especially the rubbery ones. If you really need to, use wet wipes, or alcohol.

Back when I was only using 1 pair of foam earplugs (the one in ACE hardware), I keep on using it and replace it after 3 months with very frequent use in the office (my officemates are loud). With a pair, I believe you can extend their lifetimes because you put lesser stress on them.

PS: I replaced my earplugs not because they're ruined. But because animal proteins, dust, sweat, moisture, earwax, oils and stains will build up eventually. That's not a limitation of Mack's, it's' a limitation of foam."

"That's a huge part of the problem.  They're competing with a huge market, that does what they're trying to do better.  People told them this was a bad idea, but CCP knows best...all of their past weird business decisions have worked out great!"
Oops! All Republican Captain Crunch
L
"&gt;where all employees collectively owned the companies they worked for and made corporate decisions collectively.

How would this work? Let's take a business like a hydropower station, that has a very high capital cost and needs very few workers. If the people working at the power station own the company, do they take on massive debts to pay for the labour of the people who built the power station? What happens if they make business decisions that result in those debts not being repaid? 

How about say a farm which wants to hire seasonal staff, say students, and students who want to work there briefly, but have no long term interests in fruit picking or what not, so long-term interests in investing in the farm's ongoing productivity doesn't matter to them? 

&gt;In general, the entire idea of a regulatory framework governing the economy - which includes things like warning labels on Q-tips, but also things like contract law and outlawing slavery - is just a huge series of patches designed to identify all of the billion big and little ways that the economy can go off the rails or hurt people more than it helps them or get into bad Nashe equlibria or be exploited or etc., and try to resolve them while doing as little collateral damage as possible. 

That's the idea. The reality is that there's a billion big and little ways that governments can go off the rails and hurt people more than it helps them.

&gt;This is a tricky business and the implementation is far from perfect, but on net it's better than the alternative.

That's a controversial claim. If government regulations are better than the alternative, why has zoning stuffed up house prices so much? Why do healthcare and education costs keep rising so much for so little overall benefit? Why are governments still subsidising fishing? 

&gt;However, many people use the term 'capitalism' as synonymous with 'free markets'. I don't like this because it makes the two words redundant and leaves us without a commonly used term referring to the the thing I call 'capitalism,' but it's a very common understanding of the phrase (in my mind, because Capitalists realized that free markets are great and co-opted the term to improve their own image).

Actually, Adam Smith was praising free markets in the 18th century, while the first known use of ""capitalism"" [was not until 1833](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism). Early free-market fans were mostly critics of existing countries for their departure from free market principles, the pro-capitalism came when socialists kept calling countries like the UK and the USA capitalist.

"One of the saddest things I‚Äôve read about that monster Ariel Castro, who kidnapped 3 women and kept them in his basement, was how he would taunt Michelle Knight.

Gina de Jesus‚Äô Mom made huge efforts to find her and was on the news a lot. Castro would tell Michelle how it meant she was so worthless because no one was even looking for her.

When they were rescued, Michelle‚Äôs mom showed up at the hospital and Michelle refused to even see her. I don‚Äôt blame her one bit.  Sadly, Gina‚Äôs mom died before they escaped."

"Using bandaid with some polysporin on it overnight is the best thing I've found for those days when I've done a number on some bad spots. The bandaid and ointment offer some protection from infection and the bandaid will also help stop the triggering effects of seeing the spot. I also recommend mixing just a little bit of sensitive skin sunscreen into your make-up (if you wear it). This will help prevent sun damage which can make dry skin and other blemishes worse (plus sunscreen tends to contain moisturizers too). Finally, for really bad cases, I will sometimes use a bit of hydrogen peroxide. Be warned, in general this is not a good treatment for your skin BUT I find that when I am having a really hard time leaving a spot alone, the peroxide does dry most blemishes out and helps me feel like I have ""cleaned"" the spot. 

As an aside, because we all pick sometimes no matter how hard we try not to, it is important to make sure you keep your fingers (or tools if you use them) sanitary. It's amazing the difference that just having clean hands can make when it comes to a disorder like ours where we're constantly opening wounds up to the possibility of infection. I hope that helps and just remember, everyone here totally gets what you're going through."

"&gt; I said in my title that *Fallout 76* makes me sad, and that's true. It's¬†a painful experience because I *really* enjoy the *Fallout* series and this *badly* makes me want to play a real *Fallout* game. Not‚Ä¶whatever this is. This doesn‚Äôt feel like an unfinished game, per se, it‚Äôs plenty big and there‚Äôs a lot to do. But it feels hollow, like an experiment no one was asking for, removing core components of the game (VATS, saving, NPCs) for the sake of something that does not seem like it was worth the trade (multiplayer PvE and PvP). Why have we come to this point where a game that's been ultra successful in the single player genre feels the need to shift so dramatically¬†to multiplayer? Is this the era of *GTA Online* at work? Whatever the case, I don't like it, and wish this game was able to get back what it's clearly lost in this exchange. 

Ah yes, clearly unemotional and unbiased reporting here. He's missing the whole point, just like everyone else shitting on the game. This game has never once been intended to be the next step. It's a spin off. A side bar. A branch in the tree. Removing VATS/saving/NPCs for multiplayer obviously won't seem worth it if you're expecting a single player game. Which it's not. 

He wants it to go back to what it lost. If it weren't a multiplayer game, it wouldn't exist. that's the problem. People think this game means we're missing out on a potential single player fallout. Which just isn't true. It was made by a spin-off studio, with a little help from the main team, who are hard at work on Starfield, ES6, and potentially FO5, which I'm as excited about as anybody. But I also like other things, and I'm excited to see what the Fallout world is like in a multiplayer setting. Especially being able to play with an IRL friend. Elder Scrolls Online didn't ruin the ES franchise or become the go-to. It's the same thing. A spin off. 

Don't assume that because I used the most obvious example (the title) to prove my point means i didn't read the article. 

Are you trying to call my personality a meme? You don't have much room to talk with your phony upbeat thing going on. Can't tell you the amount of times I've seen tools on reddit use that to be condescending. 

All that being said, yes, the writer offers up legitimate concerns. But he doesn't do it in a detached manner. He does it in the clear perspective of a fallout fan who is unable/unwilling to try something new within the franchise. There's nothing wrong with that, but this game is clearly not intended for you if you're not a fan of multiplayer games. That's okay, but that doesn't make it a bad game. 

For what it attempts to do, it does it pretty damn well. The people who don't like it are using a Bethesda Singleplayer grading system on it. Like I said, if you judge NBA 2k on its merits as a shooter, you're gonna come off like an idiot. Same thing here."

"Incompetent by purposeful design..., just like Democrats who would rather lose an election than win with a genuine Progressive like Bernie Sanders.

Immediately after 9/11 several Congress Critters got envelopes with anthrax in them, and a couple of USPS workers died as a result.  As far as I am aware, the perpetrator was never caught.  I always thought that was a good way to force Dems to back the fucking Patriot Act and acquiesce to the demands that Congress pass the unconstitutional and illegal AUMF so Dumbya &amp; Dickie could ultimately order the detour from Afghanistan to invade Iraq, an action that is a war crime....  The Patriot Act was written and ready to go before election day 2000, and people aware of the fact Dumbya was lying at the ""debates"" knew he lied when he said he wouldn't do any regime changes in other countries.  That was the instant I knew he wanted to invade Iraq to finish his daddy's war (junior always did have daddy issues).  I journaled that night that if he were elected he'd start a war with Iraq and we'd go into a recession..., but I didn't see how anyone would be dumb enough to vote for anyone that stupid.

"I think it's high time women stop putting up with porn in relationships. Of course, some women truly don't care and that's fine. But the majority of women (from my experience at least) really hate it and are scared to say anything because they know men will lash out and accuse them of being insecure. 

Let's look at the facts here (these can all be verified as scientific facts with a simple google search): 1. Porn rewires the brain 2. Men find their partners less sexually interesting after being exposed to porn, and 3. The brain doesn't know the difference between watching porn and actually having sex with all those women.

Porn is really just normalized cheating. And not only does porn rob women in relationships of actually having a loyal man, but it screws over the pornstars as well. They are regularly pressured into acts they don't want to do, mistreated  by society, and HIGHLY underpaid. For a multi-billion dollar industry, these women are only paid an average of $1000 (sometimes less, occasionally more) per video. Not to mention that many of them are coerced into it fresh out of high school. Many of the most famous adult stars were pressured at age 18 or 19 from douchebags promising them the world. I don't think porn should even be legal to act in until the decision-making part of your brain is done developing. This industry screws over women in every way possible, and we're trash talked if we speak out against it. "
"Something interesting is that while a few of the leaks are totally blocking certain characters, namely the Mii fighters, other confirmed characters have been shifted around a bit; Jifflypuff is next to Ivysaur in the official art, but the leak has her moved up next to Young Link and Ness, while Olimar has been shifted to the left to make room for &gt;!Isaac !&lt;and Daisy to make room for &gt;!Banjo!&lt;. I know not to underestimate the amount of effort someone will put into a leak after the Rayman CS screens, but still, that's an extra little detail that you wouldn't normally expect from a fake."

"I‚Äôve worn my sample today and so far I like it! I think it‚Äôs a little too light but nothing too drastic. I anticipate losing my tan since it‚Äôs getting cooler so it‚Äôll probably match better then. I have a lot of other samples to try like MUFE hd y245, y325, y335, and tarte light medium sand. My color on Sephora‚Äôs color chart was 3y07 and it gave me foundations that were very dark and orange like Nars Punjab. The girl kept matching me to darker foundations too. 

The only other foundations that work right now are tarte Amazonian clay in light neutral (it is a little too light but I can make it work. The light golden looks like a better undertone match) and IT CC in light. Others that have worked before my tan have been a IT CC in fair, MUFE Y225, and L‚ÄôOr√©al true match in W2. I was matched to MAC NC25 but it is straight up orange but I‚Äôm around that ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù I guess you can say.

"I am trying to find how Wirex works, but (again) there are no details on their site and FAQ.

It seems that you get an account ostensibly denominated in BTC, into which you first deposit your bitcoins.  Later, when you want to ""spend your bitcoins"" you transfer **those virtual bitcoins that are already in your Wirex BTC account** to your Wirex USD account, at the current market price.  Is that so?

If that is correct, then they don't necessarily keep your bitcoins.  Since the price is falling, they should sell them as soon as you deposit them.  They keep only USD, but tell you that you still have """"xx BTC"" in your account. 

That is the only way I can think of that they can ""convert"" your BTC to USD in minutes.  "

"It's funny but I got the same feeling watching the tournament. The top teams from China and Korea both played similar picks and even similar styles, in the case of RNG. I don't think China is a less aggressive region than Europe and North America - LPL has the highest kills per minute of any region. But they had surprisingly similar priorities coming into groups and play offs. It's like they prepared only with LCK teams, and for LCK teams. They used strategies that worked for them throughout the year against LCK, without paying any attention to Western teams.

This is probably partially a consequence of LCK coaches being common in LPL. It's not just a few LCK coaches here and there, like in North America and Europe, but almost every LPL team has a LCK coach, and these coaches are obviously still participating in their old social circles, sharing ideas and strategies, etc. They brought the LCK understanding of the game to LPL, and that helped LPL defeat LCK, as they're both on the same page. But at the same time, it made them vulnerable to the same weaknesses, such that once you figured out one of them, you figured out both of them.

Thus, the fate of LPL and LCK are now tied together, because of the movement of coaches. When LCK is strong, LPL is also strong - potentially more strong, due to having access to both LCK and LPL talent. But when LCK is weak, LPL also gets brought down.  

Think about it this way: had the West not showed up this world, LPL would likely have won after they took down Korea's number one team in a best of five last week. It would likely be RNG against Invictus Gaming in the final, as RNG would have swept one side while Invictus Gaming would've swept the other. Then people would be saying China &gt; Korea &gt; All, just as predicted. But instead, they both got caught with their pants down against the West, so now we have a situation where West &gt; China &gt; Korea &gt; All.

This also explains the fate of LMS, and in retrospect, how badly they performed should've been a hint that not all is right with LPL and LCK, since traditionally, LMS was competitive with the West, while this year, they just looked lost."

"Opposing dictators generally hate each other because they see each other as competition.  That's what religion is when you break it down: Competing stories.

"If I had to guess, they're probably still in the early stages of development where the vast, vast majority of Rockstar staff are working on RDR 2, and there is a relatively small crew planning out GTA 6. In that case, his comments would still make sense because they don't need to worry about the specifics of the game like satire and political commentary. But really who knows. All we can do is speculate for now."
I think it‚Äôs fair to expect this kind of thing to happen when they‚Äôre making a transition like this. This is a pretty significant change.

&gt;Reputable breeders don't breed to make money. 

Anyone who has ever told you that is a liar. 

&gt;Are you performing all OFA tests required for Poodles on all of your breeding dogs?

Yes. All our pups are have multiple vet visits before they go home. We do all vaccinations in house. 

&gt;Do you sell your dogs on a contract with a right of first refusal clause?

If a customer is unhappy with the puppy upon personal delivery, they will be refunded everything but the deposit. But that rarely happens with us. 

&gt;Do you participate in showing and/or other dog sports to prove the dogs you're breeding are the best examples of their breed? 

Many of our studs are from champion bloodlines, as well as our moms. 

&gt;Are you breeding for the love of the breed and involved in your local breed club so that you can learn the latest research on how to produce healthy, sound dogs, both physically and temperamentally?

I'm in every doodle/poodle breeder facebook group/subreddit in existence. We want what is best for our dogs health. We aren't backyard breeders.  

&gt;Do you wait until dogs are at least 2 years old to breed and wait until puppies are at least 8 weeks old before sending them home? 

We don't breed girls until their second heat cycle. Anyone who does send a puppy to their new home before 8 weeks is a backyard breeder. 

&gt;Do your buyers have to go through an application and interview process in which you turn down perspective buyers who you  believe won't be a good fit for your dogs?

Honestly, when someone is paying $1000+ before they get the pup, its not likely that pup will end up abused. 

&gt;Do you research how to properly socialize your puppies before they go to their forever homes and do so?

All pups are socialized before they go home. Its not hard to find people to play with our pups. Lol but yes, we do more than let them play with friends and fam. 

&gt;Unless you do all of these things and more, you are not reputable. 

I honestly believe we are a reputable source of responsibly bred doods n poods.

"When priests talk of it, they don't separate those two points. Every time I've heard it discussed in those words, it has been criticism of wealthy lifestyles (such as having lots of money and using it) and as a criticism of obsessing over ways to maximize wealth (donations solely as a writeoff instead of out of a true sense of charity). 

I can only really speak for what I've seen in twenty years as a parishioner in the Catholic church (though in a relatively wealthy county of Maryland), but the clergymen I met and talked with were humble and preached humility and charity, and criticized those who hoard their wealth instead of using it to help others. I cannot speak to your own experiences, but I think if you talked to other Catholics on reddit you'd hear similar stories to the one I have to tell. "

Just because you recognize your own dysphoria doesn't mean you accept social norms of gender. There are masculine trans women and feminine trans men, but they are still women and men."

2. Having a good split between Roth and Traditional lets you play all sorts of tax bracket optimization games in retirement.  It's a reasonable way to increase your total returns compared to only ever using traditional."

"Meanwhile, I‚Äôve had two stolen in North Carolina ‚Äî both of them a few thousand dollars. The first time, it was pulled between my house‚Äôs wall near my bedroom window (not visible from the road) and a bush with the wheel-well locked. The second time, it was pulled into another townhome‚Äôs fenced-in patio and chained to a fence post.

The first time, the cops said there‚Äôd been a rash of people pulling up pickups into people‚Äôs yards during thunderstorms at night and lifting power sports equipment like ATVs and scooters into the beds, when no one would see or hear anything. The second time, they‚Äôd opened the gate when I was at work and tried to cut the really thick chain, but failed, so they sawed through the fence post. Must have carried the thing, since the chain was linked through the wheels.

The first time I figured oh well, should have locked it up. People are predators, they‚Äôll take advantage of an easy opportunity. The second time, I just felt really hurt and violated. Someone came into my living space, after apparently scouting it out or hearing about it from a neighbor, during a time when they knew I wouldn‚Äôt be around and took it from me. I didn‚Äôt have a car that time, so it was my only means of transportation and I was left with $2000 on the financing when I was already really down on my luck; recently divorced, in a dumpy take-what-I-can-get apartment with my ex taking my car, down and out financially. 

For whatever reason, that made me really feel like a victim... I was just disappointed in people, that someone would put me in such a shitty situation when things were already so bad for me. It genuinely took me a couple of months to stop feeling bad about that. "

Antifa isn't an organized group and only ever organizes by twitter posts of right wing events in the interest of counter-protest. Or maybe topple a confederate statue or two. The American anti-imperialism are usually r/chapotraphouse listeners or likewise podcasts and political activists who lean left wing. Your average member of the 45 million registered Democrat voters isn't really demonstrating and trying to raise awareness in imperialism.

Are you kidding...?

The gas Fusion Titanium STARTS at **$35k**.

The Fusion Sport starts at **$40k**.

It's also disingenuous to compare the 25 mile Fusion Energi to the 200+ mile Tesla. You're actually going to be spending significantly more over the life of the vehicle in a Fusion vs the Tesla. And Tesla rightfully points this out.

"""I explained to her that it doesnt make sense that she would be depressed when her life is so much better than most others, especially mine, and that she has to focus on the positive.""

I somehow missed this line until u/crystalzelda quoted it. Wow. You need to educate yourself about depression, OP. Sometimes depression is situational - someone is depressed ""about"" something, or their life circumstances are depressing, and once the situation is resolved, the depression often lifts. But most depression is BRAIN CHEMISTRY. Most people aren't depressed ""about"" something. They are depressed because they have a problem with their brain chemistry. You basically told her to snap out of it, and that's condescending and ignorant as fuck. No wonder she doesn't like you. PLEASE do some reading about depression instead of going around trying to ""help"" people with bad brain chemistry by telling them they shouldn't be the way they are. FFS! What you did is like telling someone have a seizure to just think steady thoughts and they'll quit flailing around so much, and they shouldn't be having seizures because they have so much going for them.

&gt; The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge is seen from Hong Kong on Monday, a day before it opened.

&gt; China on Tuesday opened the world&amp;#039;s longest sea-crossing bridge linking Hong Kong to the mainland, a feat of engineering carrying immense economic and political significance.

&gt; Chinese President Xi Jinping presided over a ceremony in Zhuhai to open the 55-kilometre Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which links the city to the semi-autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau.

3 years later I am down to 182. I eat healthier, have a great workout routine, and compete in triathlons. Our marriage is still great and our sex life is awesome. I regularly send her pics of my progress in the gym and she loves it.

Obviously everyone is different and the impact this could have on someone‚Äôs metal health varies. The key is my wife made sure, I knew she came from a place of love and trying to improve our marriage.

&gt; China on Tuesday opened the world&amp;#039;s longest sea-crossing bridge linking Hong Kong to the mainland, a feat of engineering carrying immense economic and political significance.

&gt; Chinese President Xi Jinping presided over a ceremony in Zhuhai to open the 55-kilometre Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which links the city to the semi-autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau.

"There actually are many reasons, depending on the player. Not all players want narrative, some want an organic world to relate to and that's a fine approach if they want so. Remember them they are still a person in a world, andthat the patron might bite them back someday, and if they ignore you let them do. It's fine tor ecognize what kind of experience a player wants, but remember that you are the one leading the story.

However, there is also the problem where you want to make a thing but it gets underpaid by something else that does the same or better, so the feeling of playing something unique or cool gets underpaid by thinking of being gimped. While i am largely narrative player i felt the same when i compared a warlock and a cleric after level 10 so to speak.

I don't find it terribly important, but sometimes especially with homebrews or some high-perform subclasses like some in the xanathar there is some feeling of discrepancy that gets in the way of roleplaying."

"(fwiw I'm in gold and main support, so take this advice with a grain of salt, I still have a lot to work on myself).

I agree on the sleeps.  I watched the first match, and there were several times the Rein was either charging or ulting where you could have thrown sleep out on an animation locked target.

I think you could have won the 1v1 with soldier if you only got closer to him.  Great nade - now you could have gotten point blank to get an easy 70hp shot + melee and you would have eliminated him.  Don't bother healing an ejecting dva.  I'm sure you're aware that it's useless but it's a bad habit.

In second match, remember that your nano burst heals for 300hp.  I think at the point A fight around 2:15 you could have used it on one of your tanks so you could have focused on the other and maybe kept them both up.

In retrospect this worked out because you nano'd reaper and you won the fight, but IMO I would have nano'd one of your tanks earlier.

At 0:18 of point A when you died: you should have kept going around the back of the door, but I think you knew this.

Some good nades in this second match.

When your Orisa got tired I would have naded her just like before for that 300hp burst heal.  It worked out for you again because of the reaper ult, so maybe that was for the best, but I would have played it differently.

On attack, I think you could have naded Brig a few times - throw it to the side of her if she's facing you.  You can see how effective it is at the beginning of point B.

Really good comms."

"I got Gold 5 towards the end of season 6 after 800 games of being hardstuck in silver and got placed Bronze 1 in season 7 but climbed to gold3 within 160-170 games. Took a year break and in season 8 got placed s2 and demoted to s4 almost s5 but climbed back to g5. i experience these as well. it‚Äôs not only in bronze. however, i don‚Äôt main top so i can‚Äôt talk much about that part. but i do notice (from my experience) that when a top laner or jg is split pushing, teams (me included) usually have difficulty knowing when to disengage, when to pressure other lanes, capitalize on objectives, etc. which is why i said macro and playing around your team is crucial.

from my point of view, low elo in solo queue depends heavily on team fighting &amp; knowing how to abuse your lead as well. it‚Äôs either carry (you literally have to have the 1v9 mindset &amp; cant depend on your team to pull their weight), get carried (which you can‚Äôt depend on), or lose. if i go 3/0 during laning phase, i‚Äôm going to try my best to utilize this and impact other lanes whether it be a lane swap, roaming, helping out the jg with objectives or invading while also trying not to lose my lead &amp; not give up shut down gold. i haven‚Äôt mastered this yet + my micro isn‚Äôt great for my elo or else i‚Äôd be able to hard carry but that isn‚Äôt the case. keep in mind this is coming from an adc main so idk if you can apply all this to top lane. my main goals for each game are to get at least 50%+ KP and try to get a lead during laning phase through CS or CS &amp; kills. 

also, if you‚Äôre going against higher elo players, shouldn‚Äôt you be losing less LP? "

No proof of that. Reportedly this was taken from a video on Snapchat but we have no proof of that. All we have is one blurry photo. Pretty easy to slap a fake picture in there.

Where this leak one ups Artsy Omni seven-fold, it would have only taken half the work. We can't tell if these even match the poster's art style since it's so blurry. Hell, they might not even be completely new renders. The Banjo has the same pose and dimensions as Omni's Banjo, with Kazooie being different.

Idk I still feel that matching Smash 4's art style, creating a render that matches that art style, and making an actual video of you selecting that render on the select screen felt way more convincing than 7 blurry profiles and the Grinch."

Other than that, we get together with my family on Xmas Eve (because it's been consistent and done since I was a baby) with the cousins, and extended family..But, this is only done because it's local and doesn't interfer with Xmas day. We would NOT do it if we had to travel and wear the kids out before our Xmas day. 

We agreed that any family Xmas that inconveniences the actual day, we skip. So if we celebrate with his family, it would be the weekend before. Usually more of a get together like family bowling rather than a formal dinner. But if it was even a formal dinner, it would need to be a week before or one of the days after. If Xmas Eve gets to be more work than enjoyment, then we'll skip. As of now the kids are little, so we do Xmas Eve with my family as long as we can take off at a reasonable hour for bedtime routine without guilt."

And worse, if the kids are being rude to their parents, their parents quickly give in. If the kids are being rude to everyone else (loud, inappropriate language, running everywhere on a crowded street without looking up or forward) then parents encourage them by giggling with and smiling at them. You can't tell me that Koreans growing up understanding consequences, because the first time anyone tells them ""no"" is when they get to high school and they have to hear ""your scores aren't good enough to move forward,"" at which point they internalize shit, bully other students, and become suicidal because no one ever taught them healthy ways to manage their feelings of conflict.

If you think two years of working under entitled assholes who pull rank, surrounded by other entitled boys who fuck off their duties every time the CO's back is turned actually rip out the sense of entitlement from Korean males and replace it with a sense of duty and responsibility, you're fucking mad. If anything, it teaches them how to pawn off their fuckups on other people, a skill they will no doubt take with them into the workforce."

&gt; # [Defining Diplomacy Down | Council on Foreign Relations](https://cfrd8-files.cfr.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_xl/public/image/2018/10/TrumpKimRH.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; Some 25 years ago, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Harvard professor who in the course of his career served as United States ambassador to the United Nations and a US senator from New York, coined the phrase ‚ÄúDefining Deviancy Down.‚Äù The phrase was meant to describe a social trend in which behavioral standards declined over time to the point that what was once intolerable became broadly acceptable.
&gt; 
&gt; More From Our Experts
&gt; 
&gt; I am reminded of Moynihan‚Äôs phrase when I consider the state of diplomacy aimed at bringing about North Korea‚Äôs denuclearization. Increasingly, the parties involved, including the United States and South Korea, appear to be relaxing their requirements for what is expected of North Korea. Call it ‚ÄúDefining Diplomacy Down.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; More on:
&gt; 
&gt;  [North Korea](https://www.cfr.org/asia/north-korea)
&gt; 
&gt;  [South Korea](https://www.cfr.org/asia/south-korea)
&gt; 
&gt;  [U.S. Foreign Policy and Diplomacy](https://www.cfr.org/search?keyword=U.S.+Foreign+Policy+and+Diplomacy)
&gt; 
&gt; All this has taken on more than a little urgency, because it is now more than four months since the Singapore summit and there is talk that President Donald Trump and North Korea‚Äôs Kim Jong-un will meet again soon.
&gt; 
&gt; As is always the case with diplomacy, the question arises as to how to define success. Peace is one possible answer. And to be sure, peace is well worth preserving on the Korean Peninsula, given the enormous human and economic costs that any war would entail.
&gt; 
&gt; But if avoiding war takes precedence over all else, there is the danger that other important interests could well be compromised. There is the danger, too, of arrangements that would lessen tensions over the short-term but threaten peace over the long-term by requiring real compromises and constraints in exchange for promises and possibilities.
&gt; 
&gt; More From Our Experts
&gt; 
&gt; Already there is evidence that neither South Korea nor the US is anxious to demand from North Korea a full accounting of all its nuclear materials and weapons, without which real denuclearization cannot be carried out and verified. The concern appears to be that North Korea would balk at such a request, causing a crisis.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead, South Korea has suggested that it ought to be enough for the time being if North Korea simply destroys one or another nuclear facility. The US, for its part, is counseling patience and advising skeptics not to demand too much of North Korea too soon. In both cases, what we are seeing is a reluctance to give North Korea a test that it might fail.
&gt; 
&gt; More on:
&gt; 
&gt;  [North Korea](https://www.cfr.org/asia/north-korea)
&gt; 
&gt;  [South Korea](https://www.cfr.org/asia/south-korea)
&gt; 
&gt;  [U.S. Foreign Policy and Diplomacy](https://www.cfr.org/search?keyword=U.S.+Foreign+Policy+and+Diplomacy)
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time, the ‚Äúmaximum pressure‚Äù campaign has effectively ended, with calls to relax sanctions and a reluctance to enforce fully those on the books. The US and South Korea have also canceled military exercises and relaxed their force posture, respectively, easing the pressure on the Kim regime. This is what defining diplomacy down is all about.
&gt; 
&gt; This reluctance to press North Korea, however, points to the danger that Kim‚Äôs regime will be allowed not just to keep but to increase its nuclear arsenal. Indeed, North Korea could close or destroy facilities yet never denuclearize if it continues to build capacity at the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; North Korea will perhaps understandably resist a negotiation in which it is asked to do everything before it receives anything. It will demand compensation, most likely in the form of relaxing economic sanctions, if it were to eliminate any nuclear capacity. China and Russia would surely support such a request. But rewarding North Korea generously for partial measures reduces its incentive to take additional steps, much less complete the process of denuclearization.
&gt; 
&gt; The Kim regime is also certain to want to avoid being forced to choose between giving up its nuclear and missile programs, which it sees as essential for its security, and improving its economy, which is essential for social and political stability. It wants to have its cake and eat it: both continued security and greater prosperity.
&gt; 
&gt; North Korea has been pressing for a declaration of the end of war, an aspirational statement that would signal a common desire to replace the armistice that has existed since the Korean War ended 65 years ago with a formal peace treaty. Again, the question arises as to what North Korea would require in return. Already, its suspension of nuclear and missile testing has brought about an end to large US-South Korea military exercises. At some point, North Korea is likely to ask for a reduction in US troop levels in South Korea.
&gt; 
&gt; This risk is related to the focus on denuclearization. Achieving it is an understandable priority for the US, but South Korea must worry as much, if not more, about North Korea‚Äôs non-nuclear or conventional military forces that threaten Seoul, home to roughly 20% of South Koreans. The danger is that differing priorities drive a wedge between the two allies, benefiting North Korea.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite Trump‚Äôs tweets and statements, denuclearization is neither a fact nor a certainty. On the contrary, it remains a distant and unlikely goal. The challenge for the US and South Korea is to bring the goal closer without growing apart.
&gt; 
&gt; The best way to achieve this is through close consultation, a commitment to avoid surprising each another or entering into separate deals, and the forging of a comprehensive agreement on what diplomacy must achieve and what it would require in return. Existing military exercises and economic sanctions should be sustained, until there are significant changes that reduce the North Korean threat. Think of it as defining diplomacy up.

This isn't a beta, its a demo. The demo that shipped with your PCGamer back in 2004. 

A BETA behind a Pre-Order bonus is not to help the dev team, or judge servers. It's to milk pre-orders.

A TRUE TRUE TRUE BETA / Alpha, is closed sign ups, with DxDiag info uploaded, and strict testing times (aka during work hours) for when the devs can see live results and or take part themselves. 

Few few fewwwwww companies are left that do this. First one off top of my head, is Tripwire who make Killing Floor and RO. They still do it the old fashion way of what a true Alpha nd Beta means.

"Not exactly. It all depends who you are, purpose of the purchase and what your true intentions are. I have heavy experience in this field and if you're just buying drugs for your own use obv yes it is still illegal but the punishments (depending on country, there's too many variables) are going to be far less rather buying massive amounts of MDMA for distribution and selling purposes. If you protect yourself enough and follow common sense you should be fine but if you're going to be doing illegal things online be prepared to lose. Its a cat and mouse game with the LE and war on drugs. Simple things like not accessing personal stuff on your mac virtualization or not you need to keep legal activities and illegal separate in every aspect. Using different wifi's, wireless cards to access the wifi because mac addresses and serial numbers will get you caught and especially ordering drugs from another country. Keep it domestic and even with some wrong moves you'll still get away with 2-3 purchases. I guess the point is be creative because if you're following others advice the LE/GOV won't be far behind you. I know the LE/RCMP whatever are more concerned with the drugs reaching children and high school kids. That's the case where I live so if you do get caught the punishments won't be as severe. Lawyer up and keep your mouth shut. Any lawyer will tell you that when you get arrested anyways so really you don't need one when you get arrestrd just shut up."

sex with a new partner, especially one you're romantically involved with, shouldn't be boring. it's about trust, communication, and furthering your relationship. there's usually a steep learning curve, too. just sit her down, be open with her about how it makes you feel, and listen to her input."

"For a lot of people, the ""evidence"" isn't on a grand scale but on a smaller, more personal scale. The proof for them is more subjective and emotional, things that non-believers would chalk up to coincidence or rationalize as confirmation bias. It's amorphous and tenacious, sort of like the belief that you (as an individual) are special or unique, that your life has intrinsic meaning, and that things will ultimately turn out well for you; there's loads of evidence to the contrary of that commonly held belief, but most people hold on to it, both because they can't shake it on an emotional level, and because if they did shake it, it would make day-to-day existence feel impossibly meaningless."

"It is all about state-based actions. Whenever an action is completed, all state-based actions are evaluated at the same time. Two of the most common ones are:

- Is a player has 0 or less life loses the game
- If a creature has been dealt damage equal or above its toughness, destroy the creature

When the game says ""two things happen at the same time"", what it is saying is that state based actions are not evaluated in-between. Best example is creature damage. Only after all creatures have done damage state based actions are evaluated, that is why a creature with lifelink can ""keep you alive"" (life gained through lifelink does not go to the stack). However, an effect like ""whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player you gain 2 life"" will not save you, as that is an ability that triggers after the combat damage, you will lose the game before it resolves."

&gt;  Another way to harm Dash would be to support the negative projects and label anyone that has an actual criticism as a troll. 

Right, this could also be a useful tactic, although much harder to pull off. Due to the nature and makeup of our coin, most people in the Dash community wouldn't label anyone a troll, let alone someone offering actual criticism. That's why I find it necessary to remind people that we have enemies at the gate and within. Concern trolls, trolls with masternodes. Like all scammers they operate best in low visibility, with plausible deniability of their actions. Its much easier for them to lie about our successes than to attack someone using the truth like a valid criticism would be."

"Absolutely. Physical attraction is a vital part of a relationship. 

Also it can totally depend on how the situation is brought up. When my husband and I started dating, he mentioned one time, ‚Äúyou know It‚Äôs kinda a turn off when you wear ____.‚Äù  He definitely didn‚Äôt mean to be hurtful (we were so young) but I was crushed. Just the phrasing of ‚ÄúI prefer or love it when you wear ____‚Äù would have totally changed that situation. I feel like the same definitely applies with a pact like this. 

Sensitive topic, definitely. But necessary and manageable the right way. "

"&gt;DnD would not be DnD without the combat because its so integral.

So what did I run last Friday? Because I sure thought it was D&amp;D, but there wasn't any combat. 

&gt;All RP and story comes from the negative space aka Emergent Storytelling. 

Negative space isn't a lack of something; it's the space around the something. For artistic purposes (because it's is an artist's term), *negative space* is [just as important as the positive space, and sometimes even more so.](https://www.creativebloq.com/art/art-negative-space-8133765) 

Wikipedia says this:

&gt;Emergent gameplay refers to complex situations in video games, board games, or table top role-playing games that emerge from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics.

So your comment doesn't make much sense. You seem to be thinking of roleplaying as what's left over when the combat is extracted, but neither the phrase negative space nor the phrase emergent storytelling support that. 

&gt;Older editions exemplify this because RP was an afterthought.

I've been playing since 2e, so I can tell you that no, that's not the case. Folks like Gygax may have pushed the combat and antagonistic GM vs. Players mentality, and yeah, there's always been lots of D&amp;D players who never cared about the roleplaying, but ever since the very beginning there were people who got deeply into roleplaying. If you read through the old Dragon Magazines, you'll find hundreds of articles written throughout the years, all the way back to 1e, on tips and guidelines for roleplaying.

&gt;but if you aren't liking DnD's combat 

I never said that, or even hinted at that. All I said is that combat is one aspect of D&amp;D but not the only aspect. "

2. Been a raptors fan for about 8 years now (which is also when I started following the NBA and got into basketball in general) but started following this sub about 10 months ago as I've only been on Reddit for a year and a half. I think I'd be a good addition to the mod team as I'm a dedicated raps fan, I check this sub quite often during the day as I live for any and all kind of raptors news I can get (especially with the excitement of this season), I can differentiate between posts that may be solid criticism of a certain subject vs. what is a complete troll or inappropriate post, and I can hold back my own biases when looking at things from a strict moderation point of view. 
3. This sub is honestly in quite good shape with how the current mods handle things around here, but if I were to change something, it would be to filter out duplicate posts a bit more strictly. I often see after a good game or performance by a certain player that multiple posts of similar content are being put up and due to the recent hype they both would get upvoted quite a bit. Nothing wrong in that, but to keep the discussion maybe focused in one area rather than split into different posts would be nice. It would also stop people from easy karma farming. And of course, more memes would be a welcome change, can never have too many memes on this sub :). 
4. I have quite a few great memories: Masai saying in this years media day ""Put some respek on our name"", DeRozan throwing it down last season to get the lead in the Detroit game, Us winning 2 games to the eventual championship cavs team in 2016 playoffs, Cocked that joint back and banged on em, and when Kawhi Leonard resigned with in 2019 Free Agency after bring us a title.

""" cpu-frame-timing goes above 11 ms? ""

&amp;#x200B;

The motion smoothing turns on, if the frame timing is above 11ms.

&amp;#x200B;

for a frame to render, the CPU needs to prepare the frame and then send it to the GPU to render. CPU and GPU both combined are not allowed to take longer than 11ms. if you have a 11ms CPU timing, the CPU consumed ALL the time, the frame was allowed to take.

&amp;#x200B;

The value in the GPU slider is the final (combined) value. (Seems so to me). So lets say the CPU says 3ms and the GPU says 8ms, then 8ms was CPU and GPU combined. Means the GPU worked 3ms and the GPU worked 5ms on the frame.

To be fair it's easy for me to pick and choose all the times he calls for unity and civility and just ignore the often nonsensical BS, but saying it's ""laughably false"" that he never calls for unity just shows how little people actually know about Trump.

There was hardly any valid argument to counter in the first place.

They certainly didn't make much of an impact if it wasn't under-reported. While it's only a guess, I can say confidently that we'll be hearing about pipe bombs till the elections. Not that we shouldn't hear about them, but Trump officials getting ricin in the mail barely got mentioned outside the 1-2 days it might have been featured and the vandals throwing boulders through the Congressman's window didn't even merit their own article from the NY Times, who merely reposted the AP's brief report that only mentions a ""break-in"" in the headline, let alone mentioned anywhere else on their site. Same goes for the Washington Post."

&gt; The FBI says it&amp;#039;s possible that more packages were mailed and is urging the public not to handle any suspicious packages.

&gt; The Secret Service said the package addressed to Clinton was flagged as suspicious late Tuesday in Westchester County, N.Y. Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, have a residence in Chappaqua, N.Y. A second package, addressed to the Washington, D.C., residence of Obama, was intercepted on Wednesday morning.

`there was an old lady who swallowed a fly`

`I don't know why she swallowed that fly...`

`...`

 There's a beat while she sees these kids of all ages who are bald or wearing wigs, who know this song, who know what line is coming next who are living in anxiety because they don't know how long they have left who are starting to tear up...

`Do /you/ know why?`

"While it's really not that hard to praise technological achievements even when coming from Nazis, I don't get this whole narrative of 3rd Reich being superior in the field of technology.

Sure they were leaders at certain areas such as jet engines, rockets, guided bombs, but at the same time US had advanced bombsights, gyro sights for fighters, stabilized cannons on tanks, radio-fuzzed AA rounds. American troops had semiautomatic rifles while German troops were armed mostly with bolt-action rifles until the end of the war. Heck even Russians used a ton of automatic weapons.

As for German Nuclear program they didn't even had a bomb program since their scientist didn't come upon the idea of enrichment of Uranium. They were working on creating nuclear reactors which would be ready log after the war was over. So this whole idea of Germans being one step away from nuclear weapon is just another fantasy."

"You have stated only 1/2 the formula here.  Based on what you wrote there are 2 possibilities

Possibility #1:  $1 match for every $1 you contribute on the first 6% of compensation = you put in $1, they put in an additional $1 for a total of $2 dollars (likely). 

Possibility #2: $2 match for every $1 you contribute on the first 6% of compensation = you put in $1, they put in an additional $2 for a total of $3 dollars (unlikely, but hey ... some companies are generous)

They stop at the 3%/6%(?) based on your post, as they need to limit the match contribution amount to something they think they can afford.

"&gt; people in Poland use diffrent criteria in electing local politicians and electing parliment. 

That's such a weak argument. What you're saying sounds true, but local elections have always been strongly correlated with the popularity of a party. You're never gonna see a 50% party only win 25% in locals or the other way around, if 35% of people support X party, that party is probably going to win around 35% in local elections. I've never seen any elections where this doesn't hold true. On an individual level, you're right that some 2% party could win against the governing party's candidate, but on average, in the whole country? Yeah, no. 

Also, saying they won more seats than in 2014 is a good thing for them is wrong for the exact same reason. It's true that they did, but back then they were still on an upward path, they only reached their peak like 2 years later, the fact that their percentages were worse than 2 years ago and that they performed worse than expected, combined with the fact that the turnout was very high, which usually indicates a desire of the people for change, pretty clearly indicates that PiS is passed their peak and are now on a **downwards** path. Which is definitely not good news for them, no matter how you spin it.

I mean if you had 40% popular support at one point, and then only end up with 30% a couple of years later, you wouldn't call that a win just because you were at 20% 4 years earlier. Is what I'm saying. Governing is eroding PiS's popularity. Which is pretty normal in any democracy. That's why parties don't usually rule for more than 4-8 years at a time."

The hive reddit mind makes me furious because it's aversion to hard work and dedication every time the topic of how to lose real weight comes up. 70 pounds overweight is A LOT. Going for a light walk after dinner... that ain't doing anything. 

Why do people act like women are not strong? Women can handle a football coming out of them AND THEN LOOK FORWARD TO DOING IT AGAIN. Women are super tough mentally and physically and if you are in a loving relationship I promise you that she will love and respect you more for being open and honest about it. 

If she ""feels hurt"" because you were honest with her, that is entirely her problem, also, problems ARE NOT BAD. Problems = Progress. 70 pounds is a lot of weight, and if you need to make this progress then there will be some problems that will lead up to it. You can't make the omelet without breaking some eggs my dude. Good luck.

"In addition, even when the reporter has a master's degree in science journalism they may work for an editor who's incompetent at science and mucks up the facts before publication. The editor is in the business of selling eyeballs to advertisers.

Private firms have also been known to circulate press releases that tout preliminary findings which haven't been peer reviewed. Lazy journalism reports those findings uncritically if it has a catchy headline and a good hook. That press coverage boosts the stock price and/or impresses the venture capitalists.

Most of what's going on there is still science if one rummages around for sourcing and reads with a critical eye, yet those informational checks and balances are weak enough that outright frauds have been perpetrated on a grand scale.

The sign is a clean metal plate that is freshly installed, but it is placed on top of a marked wall with a variety of wear on it which rules out a mall or an office building.  The plate is independently produced which is common to most buildings, but the inclusion of English means that it is in a place where they expect foreigners. However the spelling means that English is expected, but not used often enough to warrant or provoke a correction so it would likely be out of the way enough to have it. "

"""What you dismiss as merely _stress_, my lord, I bore witness to with mine own eyes. Stress does not drive a man to hallucinate,"" Gwen countered, a frown plainly evident upon her features.

His nonchalant attitude to her words caused a disquiet in the woman's heart near as great as the scene of the king himself had left her distraught. More and more it was sounding as though the Hand were the wrong man to have approached.

Maybe she needed her father after all.

A hard crack resounded throughout the audience chamber, the sound of Gwen's hand smacking itself across the albino's face.

""How dare you,"" she hissed, rising to her feet and with emerald eyes full of fury. The food was left forgotten, utterly unimportant with how much anger that question caused to course through the woman's body, coiling itself like a lioness prepared to pounce.

""How _dare_ you ask me that. Even if I were willing to betray this family that accepted me when I was but nine years old, it would have remained an abominably _stupid_ idea. I came to you, Lord Brynden, because I believed that we needed to _protect_ the king. Now I see that my time was wasted. I will not sit here and accept an insult like this.""

&gt; Saudi Arabia&amp;#039;s $6 billion assistance package of loans and deferred payments to Pakistan will immediately relieve pressure on the cash-strapped government and improve its negotiating position during the tough bailout negotiations with the IMF, media reports said today.

&gt; In the deal announced on Tuesday after Prime Minister Imran Khan called on Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz, Riyadh said it will give Pakistan $3 billion in foreign currency support for a year and a further loan worth up to $3 billion in deferred payments for oil imports.

&gt; Saudi Arabia will place $3 billion cash deposits with the State Bank of Pakistan, in addition to providing a one-year deferred payment facility for the import of oil, worth up to $3 billion, according to the Pakistan Foreign Office.

"Hey Guys ! Need some advice here on how to manage my resources !

Basically; i'm f2p so i usually save my resources for units i really like (i was gonna spend some on tifa and sieghart next)

...Then the Halloween Banner came around and i saw Lucius's TMR which seems to BiS for Tifa. And i also quite like Lillith, so she would be a good consolation prize in case i wouldn't get Lucius. Since they're limited and i figured i could possibly get Tifa down the road somewhere if im drained for her banner i decided do the first 3 rounds of the Step-Up on the new Halloween banner.

I got two Lillith's and have the last two laps on the step up left. I have 6500 Lapis remaining so with the new Story Update tomorrow i could probably get to 10.000 Lapis until next week to do the full lap and get one guaranted Rainbow.

Now, since i already have a 7-Star Lillith i'm contemplating whether i should just be happy with what i got and save for Tifa/Sieghard or continue and hope to pull a Lucius for the TMR.

I would be pretty disappointed if i continue and Lucius doesn't show up, then again, i really want his TMR.

What would you guys do ? Be happy with 7*Lillith and stop here or go all the way and hope to pull one, possibly two Lucius from the last two laps ?"

&gt;It‚Äôs funny how guilters actually debate the prosecution story and agree that the exact scenario theorized by the state might be flawed, however, truthers eat up every single word zellner says as gospel. It‚Äôs truly mind boggling, the cult that has developed around her.

The guilters are able to debate the prosecution because its set in stone.  Truthers don't have the burden of crafting an alternative theory "

As shown in figure 2, fatalities resulting from attacks by far right wing violet extremists have exceeded those caused by radical Islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 years, and were the same in 3 of the years since September 12, 2001. Of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since September 12, 2001, far right wing violent extremist groups were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while radical Islamist violent extremists were responsible for 23 (27 percent). The total number of fatalities is about the same for far right wing violent extremists and radical Islamist violent extremists over the approximately 15-year period (106 and 119, respectively). However, 41 percent of the deaths attributable to radical Islamist violent extremists occurred in a single event‚Äîan attack at an Orlando, Florida night club in 2016 (see fig. 2).

"And you think that this iteration of the Gwent will be different? 

You will see soon enough, once the meta will establish that this game has the same issues it had but in a new shell - the tech cards are too expensive to run and are way below the power curve for people to even bother with them, you have limited options and no way to shut the opponent's strategy once he starts rolling, which in the end will turn into trying not to outplay your opponent, but outgenerate his points. Which we've seen before.

The moment when you don't even see G:Igni in the play is a massive warning sign, the card that can reliably land every match is not even played because it's simply not generating enough points on it's own while eating a good chunk of your rations. And this is a case with most situational cards, there's not enough room in the decks to include cards that are not the part of the strategy and cannot generate points on their own. Which we've seen before.

You don't have to believe me now, but there's a lot of red flags saying we are back on the path of both sides playing their own game with very little interaction between them, and we will be seeing again decks that are the best at generating points sitting at 70% win rate and played everywhere because even though the Homecoming brought a lot of cool concepts is not answering the issues the game had.  It's the same core in a new shell.

Not to mention that there's so many cards that are extremely hard to balance and with the slightest change they'll go from broken to trash. Which we've seen before, but this game won't survive another Midwinter patch which was trying to address that.

And that's not even everything, just lets just hope that I'm wrong."

Put in the most that they will match. Match means they put in what you do. It‚Äôs referring to you gross pay...pre tax. So if you make 100k you would be putting in 6k and they would be putting in 6k the best part is that the money taken out before you‚Äôre taxed on it so you don‚Äôt feel the hit as much.  Always take the match it‚Äôs free money.
"&gt; It's your entire philosophy. ""You need to do something about it! **That's how you'll escape your loneliness.**""

Yeah, see, that's the part I never say. Because unlike you, I don't pretend to know that any particular person *will* or *won't* escape based on their current circumstances. What I do is tell them what others (like me) have done to improve their chances of escaping. In the reply that you jumped on, I wasn't even telling OP that those things *would* help him. I *asked* him whether or not he thinks they could. To gain more information about his circumstances and tailor any further suggestions I might have.

&gt; Rest assured I'm actively working to maximize my prospects in life.

Oh. So...you're just a hypocrite. You're doing the exact thing I'm encouraging others to do, while discouraging others from doing them. Nice.

&gt; If you're a 5'1 male Indian janitor in the US with acne scars, an asymmetric face, hooked nose, and a lazy eye, you're fucking doomed to a life of romantic loneliness. 

Except for the ones who do eventually find someone. I don't know how old you are or how much you're been out in the world, but there's a reason why there's a prevailing belief that ""there's someone out there for everyone."" Whatever combination of physical and mental defects you can come up with that supposedly dooms someone to a live without love/happiness, chances are that someone out there has them and lives a fairly happy, love-filled life. 

Might it be unlikely? Sure. But it's not ""impossible,"" so long as effort is being made. And that's the truth you can't seem to accept. That the hope isn't false. That the onus is on you to seek it. But that you can fail all the same. You can call it cruel all you want, but that's an appeal to emotion and doesn't it make the reality any less true."

"If you want a cheap starter option, I've gotten a lash serum with biotinoyl tripeptide-1 from my local Marshall's for $7! They usually have a few different brands, all with similar formulas and the same peptide ingredient. I bought one to wean myself off Rapidlash, which is expensive, and so far my lashes have maintained their Rapidlash length (there was never much change in volume or lash count -- my lashes just got a lot longer) and even seem to have improved in length and curl at the outer corners. 

I would NOT recommend Rapidlash because I think they've reformulated recently. I've purchased 2 tubes, and upon switching to the second tube after tube 1 ran out, my lashes got shorter -- still much longer than they naturally are, but shorter than they were on tube 1. IMO they reformulated somewhere between the 2 tubes. They used to contain isopropyl cloprostenate, which is the prostaglandin analogue similar to Latisse, but on tube 2 they didn't list IC as an ingredient.

Right now I'm looking at a brand on Amazon called Glamor Lashes that goes for $25. They have isopropyl cloprostenate listed in the ingredients, so I'm hoping it'll be good. Haven't bit the bullet yet but I want to use the Marshalls serum for a bit longer before I do. "

"The Cato Institute is a right-wing think tank. I listed it over the other specifically because even right-wing sources support that right-wing terrorists commit the vast majority of terrorist attacks.

&gt; And perhaps the leadership doesn't recognize Charlottesville because THAT PROTEST DID NOT REPRESENT ANYTHING THEY STAND FOR. Nationalism does not equal white supremacy. Populist politics does not equal fascism. 

'fine people on both sides' Trump literally supported it. Everyone not living in your fantasy bubble knows that. By the way, not condemning people who go around committing murder in your name is tantamount to support.

&gt; A Gulf War veteran, McVeigh sought revenge against the federal government for the 1993 Waco siege, which ended in the deaths of 86 people‚Äîmany of whom were children‚Äîexactly two years before the bombing; the 1992 Ruby Ridge incident; and the United States' foreign policy. He hoped to inspire a revolt against the federal government, and defended the bombing as a legitimate tactic against what he saw as a tyrannical federal government.[5] He was arrested shortly after the bombing and indicted for eleven federal offenses, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction. He was found guilty on all counts in 1997 and sentenced to death.[6]

McVeigh was literally the sovcit type of terrorist we see a lot. *He didn't have the same political motivations of right-wingers now, however. That is an important distinction. A lot of it was drawn from Ruby Ridge/Waco type stuff. Analogous to the 'obummer's coming for our guns' type and the Oregon terrorists."

"I think you're a decently good looking dude. You have a good foundation of nice eyes, solid eyebrows, good hair, nice skin. Your prescription glasses look really good with your face shape (not a fan of the sunglasses- a bit dated).        

While I think you look good with a beard, I don't think it's doing you a huge favor with how it's currently groomed. When you have a thin beard, it looks fuller when it's longer, but in a scraggly sort of way. The mustache especially is long enough that I don't want to kiss it.        

I'd suggest going to a nice barber and getting it trimmed up. Once you see how it can look, you could probably manage maintaining it yourself at home. While you're at the barber, I think it would be worthwhile to get a nice haircut as well. If you went shorter on the sides and left it long on top, it would make you more stylish and put together looking. It would also give a better transition between your beard and head hair [like this](https://i1.wp.com/grooming-heroes.ar26ri6.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Style_Thin_Beard_Cover_700x350.jpg?resize=698%2C349) (but maybe not quiteee that short on the sides).

Though in this case it would be considered necessary, wouldn't it? Circumcision is especially nasty because it's optional pain. This operation is done to safe the childs life or at least vastly improve its quality. 

If its sufficiently unlikely the pain will have lasting effects it seems the safest option may be the most cruel. Now that will likely not hold up/be this simple in a realistic scenario but  in a contained thought experiement I find the implications of that conclusion interesting."

It's generally just a fad diet like anything else - it works by eating fewer calories and the massive results you see in the first month is mostly water weight. You can disagree and have your own success story, but you can't lose weight unless you eat fewer calories than you burn, that's just how it works.

The ""eat better, not less"" mantra is still valid, though. Eating better foods with protein and fiber will keep you full for longer, causing you to eat less. And you'll also be healthier!"

"&gt;  They did bad because of backlash against the ACA, rightly or wrongly. 

That's oversimplifying. I think the poor performance in 2010 can very well be attributed to Obama not helping to campaign for Democrats, as well as backlash to the ACA, as well as midterms consistently going poorly for the president's party with rare exceptions (1998 and 2002 are the only real ones, and that was a time when the political differences between the two parties were vanishingly small), as well as congressional Democrats running away from Obama in a time when he was still somewhat popular (his real doldrums were closer to 2014). If Obama and congressional Democrats instead embraced each other, it probably would have gone a lot better, and if the ACA had been politically smarter (*cough* Medicare For All *cough*) it would have gone a lot better. I still think they would have lost seats because the Democrats were inordinately popular in 2008 with an extremely high number of legislative seats, and some return to the mean should be expected, but it might not have been such an unmitigated disaster."

I get not wanting to spend 2 hours a day cooking, prepping, eating, cleaning up. But if you're just wanting nibbles you can spend literally spend 1hr a week, if that, weighing/portioning out items into baggies or containers for easy grabbing and nibbling while working. Plenty of healthy low-cal things that you won't even need to cook. 

Can you get grocery delivery, or order online and pickup? That can help you choose healthy items without having the mozz sticks in your face, and save time as well. 

Lots of vegetables you can get pre-washed and/or chopped at the store. Both party tray setups and ones intended for cooking. Even if it's in a package that says fajita vegetables, it doesn't mean you can't eat your bell pepper strips raw with some hummus. 

I eat pre-made snack packs with cheese, nuts, fresh fruit, deli meat, raisins or dried cranberries, crackers, etc. Both the pre-made ones and the ones I make it home are in the 180 to 200 calorie range.

"One of the things that Liz still did not know at the time is that Red had been the one to hire Tom.

Tom did not now who his first employer was until he was fired, married Liz and Berlin found him likely by following Red to that wedding and from there arriving at the Major.

Certainly there is a lot more to the issue of who is Scottie to Liz:

1. Rostov goes for Halcyon Aegis among all the other contractors.  

2. Scottie said SHE took the job as a matter of survival, and this is not about money, so this is about information.  The connection seems to be on the Katarina's side, because Scottie's instinctive name for Liz is Masha.

3. It seems Howard did not know about the job.   I have no confirmation, but I always through that the person in that room with a minder in Scottie house in DC was a drugged Howard, kept away until the operation was completed.   Since in Redemption Howard had found Tom circa 2015 about the time when Tom had come back from the Dresden assignment, Howard would have prevented the violence against everyone else.

4. Red tells Scottie ""people like us"", implying that whatever Red is, Scottie is.  And this is not about a criminal as Scottie is not, so likely Scottie is a covert agent, like Red.  Like Red, staying for a long time on the mission. The assumed identity becoming who they are.

5. As u/jen5225 says there is a photo in Scottie's study in the house of a [dark haired woman with a girl blowing bubbles](https://tessabltheorist.tumblr.com/private/179397639612/tumblr_ph4kwrGpjV1uh8h84).  It is in a wall where there are 2 personal pictures, not of Scottie with clients or celebrities, a golden retriever dog, and that picture, and on a table, the picture of Tom with her and Howard the year he vanished.

6. Liz and Scottie share a middle name.  Liz was Elizabeth Scott Milhoan before marrying Tom.   So we know that Liz did not come by that middle name as her maiden last name.  She could have as her mother maiden name, or as her third ""father"" last name, because one thing we MUST remember is that Liz, as Constantin daughter was Masha Rostova, or maybe Maria Rostova, complete with a birth certificate, real or fake.   Probably not a real one, and the way that Masha Rostova was rumors only.     But did she also had a real or fake birth certificate as this third man's daughter?  This man who KNOWS her as Elizabeth.   So either Katarina's name or one of her names is Katarina Scott or this third father's last name is Scott.

7.  Susan on the other hand could also have the name as her maiden name, generally.    So we can probably say that Scottie's name before marrying Howard was Susan Scott.

8. **The fact that Constantin Rostov would be going in and out of the USSR with his real name BEFORE the dissolution of the USSR, but later on he assumes this name when people already know him as Constantin Rostov**.  This speaks to that name, which affords him protection after Katarina dragged his name through mud and manure by abandoning things and be branded a traitor.  And to be able to do this it would mean that the Russians knew the name Alexander Kirk but not the face.  So it would seem that Alexander Kirk was a codename used by someone helpful to the Russians and Rostov took it because it afforded him protection.

9. Point number 7 implies that Scottie Hargrave is either a sister or cousin of Liz's third father, or a sister or cousin of Katarina.  Or was posing as a sister to the identity Katarina Rostova when Katarina was sducing Constantin. A relationship she needs to keep secret.  Certainly it opens up the possibility that at the very least Tom and Liz knew each other as children.

I do not think that they are half siblings, as we know Tom is Howard child (he had a DNA test in his clue wall) and Scottie says she had a feeling of closeness and that Tom reminded him of Howard.  So we can be sure that Tom is Howard and Scottie's son.  Liz is the daughter of Katarina and Red, or for those who do not believe this, of Katarina and this third man, and in this case they are first cousins.  

But if Katarina and Scottie are cousins or sisters, then they are first or second cousins.

And for those who are getting uncomfortable first cousins share between 7.31%  and 13.8%, and second cousins share 2.85% - 5.04%.  In most countries where laws had been updated to modern genealogy, first cousins marrying do not even need genetic counseling . the chance of 2 first cousins having a child with genetic trouble is quite small:

&gt;In the general population, the risk that a child will be born with a serious problem like spina bifida or cystic fibrosis is 3 percent to 4 percent; to that background risk, first cousins must add another 1.7 to 2.8 percentage points, the report said. NYT

So **if Liz came by the name out of her third father real name** we have that likely Scottie and this man were siblings or cousins, and Tom and Liz are first or second cousins.   And in that case the name Alexander Kirk will have  a very interesting  connotation of Star Trek: Scott &amp; Kirk   

is **Liz came by the name Rostov as her mother's maiden name** we would have to distinguish between the identity being her real name or one of her assumed named.  

If it is an assumed name, then it probably only mean that Katarina and Scottie posed as sisters or cousins and Scottie kept the identity. Like Tom Keen and Craig Keen (whose real names were Christopher Hargrave and Christopher Maly by the way (thanks to someone who mention this and I cannot remember who)). 

or they are real cousins or sisters, and Liz was given the name Scott to create a link to her mother's real identity.

If they are relatives, be sisters or cousins, then Scottie could be the other reason Dom had to walk out the door, because I have always believed that when Dom said the baby he was deflecting.   I felt that  Dom had still family he was estranged from.

But what it seems is that unless the Scott name was an identity, meaning nothing, Scottie is Liz's biological aunt, or was the sister of the third ""father""

But the connection of a name Scott and a name Kirk cannot be ignored."

"I think that most people feel that it was a hoax.  This may never really be proven.  We have to recognize a couple of things.  One is that there may be mental health issues involved here.  Another is a lot of police time and resources would have to be used to definitively show that it was a hoax or something that Sherri and others concocted and carried out.  And such actions would be counter to the idea that it was a waste of time to begin with. What I mean is that it would be like asking asking police to continue to investigate the killings that nearly everyone believes were done by OJ Simpson.

&amp;#x200B;

My guess is that this was some weird hoax.  The motivations of those involved in would likely be  sordid, perverted, and strange if we could somehow know them.

The best hope of a full understanding here would be a confession by the hoaxers.  And that's not likely to happen soon.  But if their marriage ends, or if a witness decides to come forward, or possibly a death bed confession, then we might know the truth one day."

"It really doesn't matter as the notion that your life will improve by upgrading your neighbourhood is an illusion. Olympic Village is very trendy but I agree being near Skytrain is wise, I would aim for 5 min walk of a station that goes in various directions, like Waterfront station. Being near the Seabus is an advantage to avoid Lions Gate traffic nightmare, as well as the views from the seabus.
But easy access to all 3 skytrain routes as well as the 99 along broadway is def smart. Notice how restaurants and other businesses become the priority for some. These are often the people who don't/can't cook for themselves. They need restaurants and cafes to feed them their injections of caffeine, sugar, oil, pot and liquor. This shows our materialism and obsession with products. We are a really commercialized consumer driven people. We move to neighbourhoods because of restaurants and cafes. lol. 
And when I hear of the guy excited by the lifestyle upgrade I just laugh, do you really mean it? Please come back and report on how excited you are in a month about your new neighbourhood. Well you tell us the truth about how much your lifestyle has upgraded since you left Surrey in the dust for Mount Pleasant. Now, the West End is a saturated, dense area full of 20 somethings who don't really talk to anyone outside their various cliques. It's also trendy, and transient, and probably not a very close-nit community. But, where you going to find that in a big city? In Mount Pleasant? But I do agree it's better than West Side or Kits (these places are has been places that are barely hanging on). They only have their reputations to go on, and many have left due to the increasingly cringy vibe down by the beach. East Van probably has ""real"" people who are not always putting on a show or a face for others, like they do in downtown, especially when you first meet someone, my God, what a bunch of phonies we are when we go to downtown. At least in East Van, a few have realized the pretension and have opted out by creating their own sub-culture, however it is still vile and immoral, but at least it isn't as fake or phony. Now this post is the truth: Marpole has Quiet and safe neighborhoods with pretty spacious apartment but I found myself quite depressed living there. There is nowhere to walk to except Safeway, the liquor store, and of course let's not forget the dollar store! Now, that's the reality of most of our lives. A depressing walk to the grocery, to pick up coffee, and then liquor and finish it off with a dispensary or just order it online to avoid people. That is the modern age of the average person living in Vancouver. Also the person who said Vancouver people are too stuck up thinking they are better than everyone else is right on the money. But as you can see people still come here. That's the power of marketing and advertising. Even when it's not that great, people still come expecting greatness. Take them to the DTES. And to the person who thinks by critiquing Vancouver as being pretentious then that somehow automatically implies that he himself thinks he's better than everyone in Vancouver is just beyond me. He made a remark about the city in general and its population in general. It's a generalization, and you turned it around to make it seem like an attack on everyone in Vancouver.

&gt;So if having gone through recent hardships is the mark - how long is that?

Slavery due to skin color into the 1800s is recent enough. Getting put in internment camps during WWII is recent enough. I'd say getting your clubs stormed by violent cops due to being havens for LGBT+ people within the last 50 years is recent enough. Having gay sex being illegal in some states into the 21st century is recent enough. Getting killed by cops on the basis of skin color continuing into present times is probably recent enough.

Having a distant ancestor just be a fucking peasant in the 5th century is most definitely NOT recent enough."

However, CCM has really managed to carve out its place in recent years. Where it used to be a fairly distant second to Bauer in terms of popularity, and pros using CCM sticks, gloves, helmets, and other protective- that gap has closed immensely.

"Thanks for your reply as well. To be honest, I think it's odd that more people don't talk about the fact that none of us knows anything for certain. Probably because it's an unsettling thought.

To clarify, I don't think any behavior is acceptable or that genocide and charity are morally equal. But I recognize that my morality is my own, and there's nothing that makes it better than someone else's. An example of this relativism: certain cultures used to engage in human ritual sacrifice. I don't think that cultures who engaged in that in the past were wrong in an objective sense, because I can't impose my morality on them. If I lived in that culture, I would likely consider ritual sacrifice to be morally acceptable as well.

If there are people today who want to practice ritual sacrifice, I don't think they are objectively wrong either. But as you might imagine, I do not personally want that practice to take root in my culture, and if I thought it were at risk of becoming a cultural norm today, I would be angry and would fight against it.

This is where clashes in different religions happen. Something like ""be kind to others"" is fairly universal among most religions, but as soon as you get more specific, people start to feel that their beliefs are right because their God is the one who possesses the objective truth. And since you can't arrange a showdown for all the different Gods, I think it's arrogant for anyone to claim that theirs is the correct one. I am not anti-religion‚ÄîI think everyone, including atheists, needs to be humble about claiming exclusive access to objective morality."

REPACK in scene terms is more or less the same as above

REPACK can mean something different in gaming downloading terms.

Not always the case though so make sure to read the repacks description."

"I did some research on this.

|  | LWL | Eversource |
|--|--|--|
| Energy Charge $/kwh | $0.00 | $0.09412
| Wholesale Energy $/kwh | $0.06951 | $0.00 |
| Distribution Energy $/kwh | $0.02024 | $0.04141
| Transmission Energy $/kwh | $0.01393 | $0.02039 |
| Stranded Cost Recovery Charge $/kwh | $0.00 | $0.02067 |
| System Benefits Charge $/kwh | $0.00 | $0.00455 |
| NH State Tax $/kwh | $0.00055 | $0.00055 |
| Customer Charge $/Month | $7.00 | $12.69 |
|  |  |  |

[Some explanation of the charges](https://www.oca.nh.gov/Understanding%20Your%20Electric%20Bill.htm)

I'm guessing LWL's ""wholesale energy"" is equivalent to Eversource's ""Energy Charge"" but I left them as separate items since they appear under different names.

LWL adds up to $0.10423/kwh, Eversource is $0.18169/kwh, plus a slightly higher customer charge.

LWL rates are current rates from their website, looking at my old bills the same charges are there, I just listed the current rates. Eversource rates are from my latest bill.

Assuming 500kwh usage for one month the bill from LWL would be $59.12, Eversource $103.54.

So it is significantly cheaper."

"US politics are, on average, rightwing, and have been for over 20 years (since Bill Clinton moved the Democratic party to the political center as part of cosying up to corporate donors, allowing the Republicans to move even further to the right-wing fringes).

There are ***a very few*** extreme ***left-wing*** ideas out there, virtually none of which are elected politicians, nearly all of what Republicans call ""extreme leftists"" are actually center-left politically (compared to definitions and the rest of the world).

However there are a significant number of fairly extreme right-wing ideas out there, many of which are coming from current politicians (and the President).

The challenge is that the whole US political spectrum has drifted so far to the right over the last 40 years amid a barrage of propaganda that they can't even agree what left/right actually are any more."

Only wash with shampoo every other day; your natural oils are a good thing.

At the end of the day, every doctor will say, ""You are on testosterone blockers, you don't need Finasteride or Rogaine or XYZ because you don't have testosterone."" I have yet to find a patient who agrees with that; even if you have female range T, that little bit can still make DHT which is a big culprit along side genetics. And frankly, all of this is cheaper than an insured Orchi., the only way you are going to get your T down to almost zero.

You obviously won't judge yourself, so try saying things more animatedly/casually to build up confidence and style. Try taking your work presentations or other prewritten content and making them sound more casual or conversational, like you were explaining them to friends rather than a meeting.

Finally, make mistakes and do not erase your accent. Part of why my French comes off so stilted is because I always use the first word that I'm sure I know correctly, and if I can't immediately think of something, I pause for a long time - making it so my vocabulary and phrasing has no variation. Don't be afraid to stutter, look for words, mispronounce, make minor grammatical errors even if it comes at the expense of the precise rules you have learned. When speaking casually, you want to prioritize the flow and tone of conversation over any impression you want to make or rigid rules you need to follow."

"&gt;Do you have an expectation that all males should be able to lift extreme weights, fight in wars, or run industrial vessels by themselves.

Last time I checked, men who are unfit for these things don't demand inclusion and representation, don't promise to give parity in return, and don't blame their shortcomings on prejudices and disdain from people who have been dead for a couple centuries. I have a coworker who has only one eye. I'll feel disdain the moment he gets a grandiose delusion that he's, somewhere deep in his heart, a master archer (archery requires perception of depth). Not earlier.

My shallow dive into medieval literature led to me discovering elaborate descriptions of female-run businesses, drug shops with abortive herbs, women travelling by sea and even occasionally volunteering to serve as ship's crew members. While this literature occasionally just as elaborately described the enormous submission of a wife to his husband, the only four other men that she considered fundamentally above herself - were her father, her priest, her king, and Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Entire chapters are dedicated to pure virtues of womanhood. Simone de Beauvoir herself admitted that Europe had especially strong cult of virgin Mary. If all of this is nothing but fantasies made for artistic effect, then so is Jus Primae Noctis, supposed ""right"" of the husband to kill his wife for infidelity, and supposed ""right"" of men to marry women against those women's will.

My dive into literature and culture of Central Asia has shown that their families are essentially matriarchal. The easiest way to get violently beaten to death by a traditionalist Central Asian man in a fit of rage - is to imply that his mom is a slut. Basically, up until today. To these men, mother is essentially the second most important person in the world after the Prophet. The situation isn't much different in India.

OP's post about supposed historical disdain for femininity boils down to **""Fuck The Nuance""**. Fuck the nuance that single women of Britain, Ireland and France enjoyed the same economic status as men. Fuck the nuance that Spain's majorat laws allowed the oldest heir to inherit the fee tail and the title regardless of gender, and Spanish empire instituted co-ed schools back in 15th century or so. Fuck the nuance that Italy hired women **as lecturers** into universities starting in [13th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bettisia_Gozzadini). Fuck the nuance that, since Seven Sisters colleges exist up until today and don't allow male applicants, women's ""fight for the right to education"" was essentially about (successfully!) destroying male universities, even private ones. Fuck the nuance that according to OP's own source, early medieval Ireland had functional ban on capital punishment of female murderers. Because apparently, supposed disdain from men who have been dead for centuries - justifies everything.

&gt;How do you compare women who have not done none of those three things with men who have not done those things?

Simple - **I'm indifferent towards those who did not promise and did not deliver; I respect those who promised and delivered when given the chance; I feel disdain for those who promised and did not deliver even after several chances.**

One example to be brief. By the start of World War 2, 5 out of 9 Axis nations have given women the right to vote for at least 10 years. Women promised that giving them the right to vote will end all wars.

Sorry for not being too brief after all; I tried."

"Homebrew is easy, but you do want to do some strong ground work to start with. Hash out the basic narrative and then a few branches based on the most likely directions they can interpret the breadcrumbs leading to (use session 0 to get an idea of what kind of players you're dealing with.)

Assemble a bestiary for reasonable creatures and NPCs the party can encounter in the region - if they're gonna be in a forested area, you might have wolves, bandits, hunters, druids, spiders and ettercaps, etc. These will be used to assemble and throw random encounters at the party - as long as the creatures/NPCs make sense for the region, you don't need to think too hard about it so you can use the relatively simple combat to buy time to think about where the narrative leads if they threw a curveball at you.

When you make set-piece encounters with custom monsters and NPCs, try to design them so that they could be used more or less as-is for different branches with only minor stat adjustments (the evil Necromancer with mooks could be swapped into a good Wizard and footmen sent to hunt down the murderous party, for example.)

I find that most of the work is in setting up that initial pool of creatures to use, and putting play areas together. The rest isn't too bad.

I do agree it's a lot more work than Savage Worlds (the other system I play and have recently begun looking into DMing for.)"

"Lately, a couple friends and I decided that we wanted to start breeding cats.

What we typically do is combine them with corrupted mod runs.  We typically do capture.  First, someone gets the capture target ASAP and we all split off and start searching.

Now, one thing to note about taking pictures of cats is that they spawn either containing genetic code or not, and have roughly a 15% chance to spawn with it.

When someone finds a cat, they scan it, if it contained genetic code, they waypoint it.  If not, they kill it.

Then, after all is done, open the vault and extract.

This probably isn't the quickest way, but it's what we're doing.

"SSL Certificate- Secure Socket Layer Certificate.

So when you key in your info like credit cards, or other confidential info you don't want others to see, you need this cert.  What it does is it ensure the info is being sent to the correct recipient, and the info you're getting is also from the correct reference.

Example of transaction without SSL.  Carousell.

You can buy things there just by transferring money to a person.  Let's say the seller's name is Brad Pitt.  When you go to Brad Pitt's page, and buy something, he can reply just send this to my bank account, here's the bank account number.  Then you transfer money. He replied, ok i received.  And you wait for the items to arrive.  What if that is not the real Brad Pitt?  What if that's the real Brad Pitt but the the reply was from someone else?  

The SSL cert will help you clear that doubt.  It ensures that you're dealing with the real Brad Pitt.  How to get the certificate?  Well the real Brad Pitt must buy it from the Cert Authority, and put it on their domain."

If you think that it's just a meme thing used for emphasis, and you do it yourself, no harm no foul. If someone points out to you that it's being used by literal Nazis to further fascism, and you *continue* to use it, that's where you cross the line into being, at the very least, someone doing a shitty thing with little regard to the consequences of your actions."

"They werent really given prime position in the Rumble. The Rumble is all about surprise spots and exciting moments. Nearly every woman in some way got a prime position. The women who actually show up (ie are not injured) like Sasha were rewarded by spending the record amount of time in there, and recieving lots of praise for it. Becky also had lots of time, and got to eliminate Lita. Everyone was positioned in places for a reason, to pace the match and get reactions. They all had cool placements. Nikki is an easy choice because she has buzz, and gets the right type of heat. There was no angle to be spun into, because the whole point of the rumble match was that the winner was going to feud with Charlotte, the champ. If WWE did want to spin an angle, they would have? Like they obviously didnt, because they didnt. 

It doesnt happen often, but then again its not often a WWE womens wrestler is as injured as Nikki has been, and yet still willing to put her body on the line, and still as relevant and getting as much buzz as she has.

She absolutely did work a full time schedule when she returned in 2016 after a broken neck. As I already said, in all your comments youre mentioning time away as if she is not obligated to do so because she literally BROKE her neck wrestling. She physically CANNOT, as much as she wants to, do a full time schedule anymore.No she wasnt just at the ones Cena is at.
Even most people who dislike them dont bring that up for Brie, because it literally does not make one jot of sense. And she really isnt getting any opportunities, apart from being a sidekick to Nikki and briefly Bryan.
Its Nikki that gets the shine, and thats because its Nikki who is adaptable as a wrestler, brings the attention in feuds, as appeared on shows like Dancing with the Stars, etc. "

"Well, I stuck my dick in crazy. Like they always tell you not to. The sex was ridiculously good. And I was hooked. But she was also really clingy, I was fine with it because I said to myself how bad could it really be. The first time we had sex, she told me she loved me and that I was such a good guy, and to never break her heart. Later that week I took a nap during the day, and I woke up to 14 missed calls in 30 minutes. I let it go because I found she was drinking and maybe that was it. But nope, she did it again, but this time suspected me of cheating on her, I had a test and wasn't texting for a couple of hours. I had 51 missed calls in one hour. I broke up with her because it was too much. And I also found out she was the one cheating, (she hooked up with one of my acquaintances the night she was drinking, and the guy fessed up to me), she would never admit it. But that was obviously not the end of it. Because she told me she had a new bf, my friend who was a virgin. He was pretty bad with women, I warned him, but he wanted this. She would send me pics of them having sex, send me messages saying she loved me, and to take her back. All in just a san of two months with her she turned my life upside down. She would stalk me when I got out of class, and tell me she loved me and to take her back. She would grab my hand, and try to place it on her boobs, to show me how much I would love it. It was insane. I had to deal with this for another 6 months, and legit watch out for her when I walked out on campus. She continued to harass me and send me provocative messages, and after a year it finally stopped. Never stick your dick in crazy."

"There are several apps which uses the proximity sensor to turn on the screen. The main use case for it is when you take the phone out of the pocket, the screen automatically turns on. When it's on the table (for example), I just wave my hand over the sensor and the screen turns on. Maybe this will work for you.

As for locking the screen, I use Nova Launcher Prime and there's a double-tap shortcut which can be configured to lock the screen. Note that due to the way things work (for whatever reason), if the screen / phone is set to immediately lock, you'll need to enter the pin / pattern and the finger print unlock will not be available. You'll need to set a 5 second timeout (under Nova launcher advanced settings) in order to work around that."

I will admit that those last two topics could and should have stats included in them, but it is so early in the season that they need context in the form of individual game statlines and an actual description of how they played. Obviously highlight videos usually take care of this for especially for great performances and guys like lebron, Curry etc. who will always have their highlights put up. But if someone wants to talk about someone‚Äôs statline at this point in this season, they should explain how they played or link a video. That‚Äôs what we should post"

"Yeah, Kurds and Assyrians don't go well together. The Kurds in general don't play nice with minorities in their own territories, and the Assyrians are a glaring example of that.

The Kurdish-Assyrian tensions go back pretty far, too. Like you've mentioned, there's attempts to appropriate Assyrian history, as well as an effort to erase the Assyrian identity by portraying them as 'Christian Kurds' (note how similar that is to how the Turks tried to erase the Kurdish identity by portraying the Kurds as 'mountain Turks'). 

But there's also other factors, like land theft; corrupt Kurdish officials trying to take advantage of the relatively isolated Assyrian community; tribal fueds that can go back as far as the days of the Ottoman empire; and of course, prejudice and hostility from Muslims against non-Muslims.

On a side note: the major Kurdish political cliques in Iraq are far less secular than the PKK or the dominant Kurdish factions in northern Syria. And even though they're a diverse bunch, Iraqi Kurds do tend to be pretty conservative and religious in my experience.

One particular problem that Iraq's non-Muslim communities are facing is that they are commonly perceived as a foreign element. And this is especially true for the Mountian Assyrians and the country's other Christian communities - they get derided and dismissed as ""western"", even though these communities have existed in Iraq since before Islam even existed at all. 

The communities that are neither Muslim nor Christian (mainly Mandaeans and Yazidis, as well as a few small groups that have significant Islamic influence but aren't unambiguously Muslim) are at least not as explicitly associated with the West - but in practice, this doesn't help them much.

On that note: the position of the Yazidis has become quite similar to that of the Mountain Assyrians, and they're facing largely the same problems. In both cases, the Kurdish authorities in Iraq are trying to control them (occasionally through violence and intimidation), but when push comes to shove, they care nothing for what happens to either community. Just look at how the peshmerga did nothing when IS invaded the Sinjar area or the Nineveh Plain.

The Turkmen communities in northern Iraq have also gotten a lot of shit from the Kurds. But they're still in a much better position, because they're Muslim and because they're openly protected and supported by Turkey.

"I understand what you are trying to say. You are asking how to recover during a debate when you have to give ground on a premise that is not fatal to your overall argument. Meaning you have made a statement that has shown to be false but the main premise of your argument remains intact.

Its possible to recover from something like this but what is more important is too not let the debate stray from your main premise too far. In fact, derailing an opponent's argument towards something they might be less prepared to defend is a common tactic people use. You have to ignore attempts by others to shift the topic and keep bringing it back to what you are trying to prove, restating it if necessary. In other words you need to become less flexible, not more.  

Here is an example.....

&gt;Person 1: ""Our current immigration policy is bad for the economy""  
&gt;  
&gt;Person 2: ""Denying immigrants entry is racist""  
&gt;  
&gt;Person 1: ""Its not racist to think critically about immigration policy""

Do you see the problem here, the first person has prepared an argument about the economy but ends up debating about whether or not his stance is racist. A better response would be...

&gt;Person 1:  ""No doubt some people oppose immigration for racist reasons, but I am arguing about its economic impacts""

You have to bring it back to your original premise **in every statement you make**. Make your opponent deal directly with your argument and refuse to entertain anything else.

"It's hard to do. I wanted to be a teacher ever since I was a little kid because they were the only stable adults in my life. I was definitely a handful as a student. I had teachers who had no sympathy (sometimes did, sometimes didn't know about) for my home life.

I always promised myself I would be sympathetic and treat all students with respect and leniency, and you know what? It's still hard. Little Billy with undiagnosed ADHD constantly kicking tapping his pen against his desk is still annoying. Emma constantly ""forgetting"" her homework on her desk every night is still frustrating.

We all want our students to do well and we can't know everything going on in their lives all the time. I try to focus on myself.

 I do meditation, leave room in my lesson plans for differentiation, and just try my best to just help the kids that's in front of me without getting bogged down with the ""why"". While it's important to listen to and get to know your kids, I disagree that this is the reason why. If Billy has a formal ADHD diagnosis, or never gets one, I still have to get used to the fact that he taps his pen.

I think the more important take away is what you said at the start : we don't know what's going on in their lives. And you never truly can know everything. You just have to do the best you can with what's in front of you.t"

"I owned a pair of revas and I think you‚Äôre spot on.

"Pretty much the dust unless you find it's effect fun or you are hurting for a dragon synergy deck.  

The one reason you might not want to dust a Classic legendary is there is a chance you can open him again after.  With a limited set you know when you will stop opening packs (or get a couple from rewards over the next 2 years).  Classic will keep you opening packs quite often. (1x per week from Tavern Brawl, random quests, and Blizzard rewards like HCT)"

Yes the match makes a big difference, go read my first post here when I say that not abiding to the stipulations of a retirement match is what tarnishes a legacy (not returning from a retirement caused from injury/illness).  


So Edge announcing he as retiring due to injury is the same thing as Foley losing a retirement match? Well no...one career ended in a retirement stipulation and the other didn't.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

I miscalculated my budget for the month, and will be late on rent. Which I cannot be late for for the third time in a row. Forgot about payments for my tires, and did not want them to come repo them from my car. Payment from my job is.... Weird. I'm commission sales, and the bigger check doesn't come till the middle of the month. (paid 1st and the 15th, but I get direct deposit a day early) I also receive spiffs, which fluctuate and are very sporadic and unpredictable. I mentioned ""on or before"" for that very reason. I should be able to pay this off early. Thanks in advance.

"&gt;You are acting like your average 100 IQ citizen has a clue what peer review even is. Massive theory of mind deficit.

We're talking about the specific subset of people who have strong opinions about global warming, as opposed to people who don't have much interest in the subject. Even if many might not be familiar with the specific idea of ""peer-review"" I would bet most would have some notion of the difference between research papers by scientists for other scientists that have to live up to some kinds of standard of rigor, vs. articles in Newsweek.

&gt;Yep. Why would anyone believe in any of it?

I think you are suffering from a ""theory of mind deficit"" of your own if you think most climate skeptics just make blanket dismissals of all science as fake news, most of them have some sense that science was needed to bring about all the advances in technology in the last 100 years (I doubt most climate skeptics are moon landing deniers for example)."

"No, its not really possible to get a faster divorce due to adultery. Divorce is governed by the Federal Divorce Act and separation was deliberately designed to be the easiest and most accessible ground to obtain a Divorce. We don't want people alleging adultery or cruelty for the purposes of getting a faster divorce, which was a problem back when the ground of separation took longer than adultery/cruelty. 

Everyone just proceeds on the ground of separation regardless of the circumstances. The actual reason you separated could be anything, including adultery.

A divorce on the ground of adultery is lengthier, more costly and more complicated. You have to go through everything a normal divorce demands in addition to proving adultery, which typically means going to trial (at least in Ontario, not sure about BC). Trial isn't common in divorce cases and can cost between $30,000 to $50,000 minimum with a lawyer, and it'll take multiple years to get to trial itself. Simple uncontested divorces are usually a small flat fee with most lawyers since its just basic paperwork (my firm charges $1600.00). 

I'd also suggest going to see a local Family Law attorney for a consultation. What you may consider a simple divorce may not be one. You may want to discuss your (and your spouse's) legal entitlements arising from divorce, as she can respond claiming these things, even if you want to proceed with a simple divorce. The court may also want to see a separation agreement dealing with these issues, particularly if kids are involved. "

My favourite is ""Man attempts to assassinate Trump in Nevada"". This is misleading it seems, [this Vanity Fair article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/trump-secret-service-rushed-off-stage) covers why, mainly by saying that he's a republican against Trump and he wasn't an assassin.

Ignoring the fact that it's Breitbart, the list is a gish gallop fallacy. Nearly all of the things on there are nowhere close to terrorism, unless of course you think ""Marilyn Manson ‚Äúkills‚Äù Trump in music video."" is a 101 ISIS terror tactic.

"&gt; I mean, what you quote on the wiki just sounds like the pro-choice argument to me

Reading it back, you're right, it does a little. However, I think in general, libertarians want the *federal* government out of the issue. That would allow for states to make it either legal or illegal, depending on how that state views the issue. Still other states would likely have a cutoff period in which it goes from being legal to illegal. Personally, I think that's the best our nation can do without one side completely railroading the other side on the issue.

"Nope, Sylvia Lim told the public 1 half of the story and conveniently left out the other half, same issue with CPG and FMSS

AHTC sent AIM a letter telling them they will be developing their own system and won't be using the AIM system on June 10th
https://i.imgur.com/9iCfR3N.jpg &lt;- this one

The letter that Sylvia Lim used to mislead the public was the letter from AIM on 22nd June telling them the termination will take place on Aug 1st
https://i.imgur.com/dlfRnKSl.jpg&lt;- this one

As U know, June 10th comes before June 22nd

During the court case another point was brought up. Sylvia Lim was told that AIM was thinking of terminating use of the system to AHTC &lt;- This took place before June 10th however she heard it from a 3rd party and there was no official word from AIM until the 22nd June letter

Another point that was brought up is WP never intended to use the AIM system anyway. They had already plan on using their own system before Sylvia Lim even heard about the issue that AIM might want to pull out.

So to summarize, the sequence of events went as follows

WP and FMSS started planning a new computer system

Sylvia Lim heard from a guy that AIM might pull out but no official word from AIM

AHTC sent AIM a letter telling them they wont be using the AIM system

AIM send they a letter of termination in response

Aug 1st the day the AIM system was suppose to be terminated, AHTC new system was not ready. AIM system extended

AIM contract was extended a 2nd time in Aug untii end Aug for the new system to be ready

Sept, AHTC new system ready, WP sent AIM a thank you letter

There was never an issue with AIM to begin with. AIM never pulled the system from AHTC until AHTC told them their new system was ready"

You have only known this woman a very short time. When new relationships work they are so full of vitality and energy it is easy to get swept away. As a middle-aged man I am genuinely excited to see my new friend every week, but our relationship is the definition of structured.

There is the possibility that she has been waiting her entire life for your souls to finally meet, and like a butterfly she is just about to waken from a chrysalis and completely change the course of her life.

Or. She is a middle-aged woman who gets frustrated with her husband and is having lots of fun with her new friend.

The fact you call her your soulmate makes me wonder how she would describe things. There is a real chance this relationship means very different things to each of you.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings, and I might suggest you keep writing, perhaps a ""Letter to Diane"", even if one you never show her."

"Yeah I've done this, dialer still says disable airplane mode to make calls. I wonder if different diallers makes a difference.

I never get the VoWiFi icon, but neither does my missus' pixel 2 and her VoWiFi works (is supported by Telstra directly).

Apparently Telstra are rolling it out to support other handsets. So perhaps they are literally blocking it, or using some sort of IMEI registration process..."
But i want onesieeeee
"Man you must be a scrawny little bitch if you think she's massively overweight. Overweight sure but she's about a size 16 at a guess so for a mother that's fairly expected.


You probably look at bloated African baby bellies and think they're not starving too."
"1. A lot of this has already been done. Before each big patch there has been a trailer showcasing whatever new in game content that is coming with the patch. They have also been doing interviews with BSG that have helped promote the game that included concept art as well as WIP photos.
2. They have done different things outside of the game like a book and text RPG. Mini-series cost a lot money for all director, actors, crew, set, props, etc. Best hope is that some players put out some content of their own and BSG gives it some kind of approval, which also happened with a fan made live action video. 
3. In the beginning of closed beta, streamers were giving out everything from EOD to Standard accounts. Built up hype but when people are getting into a game and being one shot by scavs that can see you through bushes, it doesn't help people stick around or bring friends in. I personally didn't try to get anyone i knew to play until the game felt a lot less like I was losing my gear to some game breaking issues. Also there were months when people were just flying around wiping squads literally wearing nothing and only using an AK-74u. Then the anticheat was implemented and there was a huge ban wave that had cheat sites down for months. After that it seemed like a good idea to tell people i knew to jump on. Streamer events would be cool but give them all a pistol, shotguns, or a 50,000 rouble budget and have to upgrade off scavs. Spawns would have to be fixed so one side of the map is playing team deathmatch while the other side is busy running around looting. Again it requires a lot of issues that would need to be fixed.
4. I am completely behind customization to help support the game. I wouldn't mind paying a few dollars to run around in my adidas track suit. No one should cry about it being lootable in game off the scav boss and im pretty sure they will have other non-scav models in game. Unfortunately I think they still want cosmetics to be ""faction based"" so the Killa cosplay might only be a pipe dream :C definitely gonna farm his helmet though. 

They probably have a ton of marketing campaigns planned when the games goes to open beta. If it were me though I would spend much more time focusing on reaching on open beta than attracting more customers into a game that might not be up to par with where I want it to be. I would also be pushing towards that because there are a few other developers that are pushing to have similar ""escape"" style battle royal games coming out. As H1Z1 and PUBG proved, it can kind of kill your growth if someone is able to put out something similar but runs betters. 

tl,dr: They have done a lot of these, spending more money on it wouldn't make sense. Better to have a game run better than to allocate resources into marketing. "

OP, I want to second the recommendation of ""The Tree is My Hat"" and add a recommendation of the novella ""Seven American Nights."" They're both fantastically complex and hint at horrors even beyond what's explicit in the text. 

You can pick up both of those in the collection The Best of Gene Wolfe. That collection also includes one novella from ""The Fifth Head of Cerberus,"" a special favorite of mine, and if you like it, be sure to also check out an edition that includes all three of its related novellas.

"In my life, I have found that God manifests himself in a more tangible way when I most need him. These do tend to be during times of crises, so you're always going to be able to ask ""how are you certain it wasn't just an auditory hallucination or fabricated in your mind?"" During a particularly stressful time in my 20s, the Holy Spirit showed Himself to me in my dorm room. He was there in His role as Comforter. The instant I saw him, I felt the exact same peace I did in the shower decades later. I knew that my situation and my life would work out. There is no way to prove God's existence in the way you are asking for. That is why Hebrew 11:1 tells us that ""faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see."" It truly is a ""leap"" of faith. I Corinthians 2:14-15 reads, ""...the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."" But the greatest wisdom from His Word is, ""For God so love the world, that he gave his only Son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life."" John 3:16. Finally, here is my very sincere prayer for you: ""May the Lord bless you and keep you. May He make His face shine upon you. May He be gracious and merciful to you and give you His peace. Amen."""
"Yes, that is the counter-argument. 

Point is that I don't think that it's always a ""a role for minorities went to X person"". Sometimes the role would just not exist.

Some may feel that it is a good trade-off to lose those roles in order to get casting directors to be more circumspect when casting *other* minority roles, I understand that position. 

I would just say though that I suspect certain roles will always have a disadvantage for hiring ""authentic"" actors vs. not. E.g. : people with certain disabilities. There'll be far more actors who are not blind or deaf than those who are. While the latter may be more ""authentic"" the former can be trained up to do an adequate job and their numbers help them here (in some cases there are other practical concerns). 

When it comes to people who are transitioning from one sex to another, there'll always be more ciswomen actors who can be changed for the camera for that one role than transman actors. 

Someone who is Asian is Asian and will remain Asian, for both obvious and specific cultural reasons you're almost certainly not going to have a white person become Asian on camera . There's a bit more flexibility in these other cases because a woman *can* transition into a transman"

"The paper check my bank will mail looks pretty much like a check straight out of my checkbook, right down to the printed routing and account number of MY account. It offers no security whatsoever beyond what I'd get mailing a paper check myself. I understand that other banks don't necessarily work this way, but assuming that having the bank mail a check is ""better"" may be a false assumption, and it requires checking the details of the service your bank offers.

And as I mentioned, allowing the recipient to opt-in to direct electronic payments requires the recipient to want to do so. The places I talk to who don't do that are usually afraid that giving out their information, even to a bank, is a security risk they don't want to deal with. They want real paper checks that they can process the way they've always processed them. "

I think about this whenever I read comic books about mystical characters.

They are all singular processes that manipulate the world around her in some way like teleporting an enemy to somewhere else or silencing someone.

"This isn't that big of a hassle most of the time.  If you pay with guaranteed funds(Cash or verifiable Cashier Check) the bank should release the title. It is rare for a bank to have a paper title anymore, but typically they will issue you and Affidavit In Lieu of Title.  This document states that the bank is releasing their interest in the vehicle and combined with a release of interest from the registered owner of the vehicle should be enough to establish yourself as the new legal owner.  

USAA is a reputable and consumer friendly bank.  I would suggest calling them and asking them how they handle this.  

Worst case scenario rather than pay cash(if that is your plan) get a loan on the vehicle and then pay it off quickly(make sure there is no pre-payment penalties!).  Bank/Credit Unions trade titles all the time for refinances so this is normal for them.  You might have to pay some additional title fees(to add/remove the bank/cu) but It would eliminate the risk of the title disappearing as a bank will not fund a loan on a vehicle they do not/will not own.

"I worked in machine learning.  The AI is not that dumb.  You don't just show the AI that 70% of the applicants are men and then the AI would automatically prefer men.  

The machine learning tools picks up very subtle correlations between the data on the applicants and performance metrics for those same people.  If women did better on whatever performance metrics the military chose to measure, the tools would hone in on that and say 'hire more of these people' regardless of their proportion of the original applicant pool.

"Bought W3, played it 6 hours, kinda hated it, thought it was boring and traded it in.

Then years later while randomly browsing reddit I stumbled upon the Witcher subreddit and read this [newcomer‚Äôs guide for the Witcher 3](http://wpc.4d7d.edgecastcdn.net/004D7D/mkt/document/Newcomers-Guide-v1.2.2_Original.pdf). I was instantly intrigued and bought it again. When I made it past the ‚Äúfirst act‚Äù which is basically just an intro, I was consumed. I put over 100 hours into this game like it was nothing. First game I ever played all the extra DLC too and those are just as great as the main story.

Incredible game. 10/10

Edit: I‚Äôm gonna change my rating to 9/10 just because it does have some tiny flaws. It used to crash a lot but I think they fixed that in a recent patch. Also the combat is a little clunky (for example, you can‚Äôt jump when engaged in combat making small obstacles like fences and rocks frustrating).  Overall it doesn‚Äôt really detract much because the combat is still quite fun. Some of the sword finisher animations are so satisfying in a twisted way. Nothing like cutting down some monsters to relieve some stress."
"Grew up in STL, I remember some awkward slopes lawns but I don‚Äôt remember ever seeing this. Although that guy definetly looks like he could be from STL. 

I can just see him an hour after this chilling on his porch listening to a Cards game, drinking a Busch, waiting for his Imos to show up, and complaining about how things were better when Whitey Herzog was still around."
"Just keep playing, it'll even out, especially this early. What do you think my k/d looks like? My 11, 9 and 7 year old play on it."
"I started off as no changes but the more I think about it, they should follow runescape classics model. 

If the game is stale or completely unbalanced (forcing people to only play 4 of the classes..) it will die quicker.

They need to continuously add content in the 'spirit' of the game.

And yes, this might mean 'balancing' some of the broken specs. 

For example, a balance druid should be viable in a raid, but not for its dps. The pure dps classes should be top dps. 

Make them an actual support role - maybe increase boomkins crit buff bonus?  Just like how shadowpriest are brought for their buff.

I also think any new content should be interwoven in the old world. Lets not have a new world like in bc, but instead add content to the world we have. This could be low level 'classic' style quests, new dugeons in empty areas ect.

Classic should never have flying mounts.

I suggest this because the moment bc/wotlk hit vanilla and the old world felt empty.

Also, at most Home Depots, they have a pipe threader in the Plumbing aisle - you can have them cut a 48"" pc of pipe down to the lengths you need- down to about 5 inches. You will save a ton of money with this step. All the cutting and threading is free. Just have your measurements and quantities in hand. "

"No. But it helps. If you're doing a degree in Computer Science, you'll find our quickly that the compulsory math courses you need to take will include some pretty tough math.

At the least you will need algebra and set theory. The basics of these will come up constantly whilst you're programming or working with databases.

Most students studying a degree in computer science struggle with the math portion. It's nothing to be ashamed of, and uni / college level math is on a whole different level to what you learn in high school. Not to mention that theres no longer and handholding; you're going to need to learn how to learn on your own.

This imo is the most important skill a developer needs to take away from his university education: The ability to walk into a previously totally unknown knowledge base, familiarise him / herself with the system, syntax and functionality, and quickly begin applying it to serve their own purposes. Math stands out as a particularly challenging example of this, and thus even if you don't end up using that differential calc, you LEARNED how to do differential calc, and that experience has steeled you for the industry at large.

Good luck!"

In my 5 years of play, I've gained skill and composure so I don't hit walls as hard or as often... but... the racquet still takes a LOT of abuse. If a racquet could have feelings, no racquet would want to be in my hand on the court ;).

I would highly recommend both racquets for durability. Additionally, I have heard similar testimonials touting the durability of racquets from both manufacturers.

"Ah poppinKream, the shareblue operative. Good to see him again.

Look at that first video. It's 95% of Trump saying he personally would want to hypothetically punch someone. 3% making unserious jabs at people who were being hysterical (yelling/screaming/flipping people off) at his rally, and 2% talking about a supporter who suckered punched someone who flipped him off right in front of him.

There was nothing that actually called for political violence. Nothing that said ""hey, go out and attack some random people like ANTIFA does"" or ""see that news Network? Attack them."".

That's what I was looking for, this was just a montage of out of context statements. You can always tell what is likely false by how long the clips of video are. Was he in middle of a sentence/paragraph when these clips cut? 100% of the time. If they showed the full clips it wouldn't be half as bad as it purports it to be."

For the past 144 +/- 27 generations (29 years per generation), they're recieved no genetic inflow from outside the community. The statistical analysis would have picked up even a 1% gene flow from outside per generation, yet it's not seen.

These estimates aren't from Ancient DNA, but admixture analysis of modern populations."

Title: **Awful Property Management**

Original Post: 

&gt; I rent a condominium complex that‚Äôs fully furnished with washer and dryer in unit. My washing machine stopped draining and would not spin 3 weeks ago. I called the emergency line and put in a maintenance request form. After a week someone finally came to drain the disgusting water out of it after I called the emergency line 3 times that night. They said it would be fixed by Monday (this was Thursday). Monday came and I‚Äôve heard nothing. Called and find out they still haven‚Äôt found a replacement unit. Another week and they finally have one and install it. This was yesterday. Came home and tried it and it does not work! The washer will not spin or fill up. I‚Äôm furious. It has been 3 weeks without having a washing machine having to spend money at the Laundromat. Am I able to demand a brand new one? Withhold rent? I feel so stuck.

"From a person who recently became a full denture wearer-

Unless you have multiple serious teeth problems, DON'T DO IT.

You have no idea how much teeth mean to you until they are gone, and a plastic ridge with plastic teeth perched on your gums is all you have to chew with.

I was without teeth for nearly 6 months after they pulled the 17 remaining teeth I had. In that time, I lost 45 pounds, from 220 to 175. I got my dentures q month and a half ago, and have only gained back 10 pounds so far.

Reason is that dentures aren't magical fix alls. Its very difficult to get used to eating, even things like toast are difficult to chew evenly, evenly being key, as if you only chew on one side, it put uneven pressure on your gums and it hurts like hell.

Even though I had an overbite with crooked buck teeth, I still regret getting them pulled, but I was at the point where I didnt have a choice.

You do, don't blow it.

"&gt; You must not understand how God works. And it seems that you are being stubborn. And you are also getting stuck on the Hebrew word for sons of God. Answer me this, when God calls upon the children of Israel, is He referring to Judah, Benjamin, Naphtali, etc. or is He referring to all descendants of Israel?
In God's eyes, you can also be referenced as the son of your grandfather. Now with this view, give me your thoughts on the scriptures I explained.

My view is that the scripture you‚Äôve listed fails to show a link between the phrase beneha‚Äôelohim and humans. My view is the only one which has any passage which definitely refers to angels in using beneha‚Äôelohim. 

Your use of the children (or sons) of Israel fails because it refers to the descendants of Israel, not Isaac. Israel is the son of Isaac, and Adam is the son of God. Therefore, if the sons of Israel refers to his 12 sons and their descendants, then the sons of God refers to Adam and his descendants, including Cain. Therefore your own comment refuted your earlier comment.  For this reason, I still defend my position. Not only have you failed to show that my position is wrong, you‚Äôve discredited your own position. 

&gt; Read verses 10-14. It describes how the Word must be read/studied. Which is was my explanation stated.

Your interpretation of this passage is extremely misguided. It‚Äôs almost the opposite of what the passage actually says. The whole section from verse 1-13 is a rebuke of Israel and specifically states that through this ‚Äúprecept upon precept, line upon line‚Äù way of receiving scripture is backwards ‚Äúthat they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.‚Äù

Normally I would say that this is impertinent to our debate and pointless to discuss, but this misinterpretation succinctly demonstrates the lack of care and attention that you are giving to the scriptures and reflects poorly on all that you‚Äôve presented here. "

https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/NXEN/news/INTIVA-BioPharma-OTCQB-NTVA-Files-a-Listing-Application-with-the-Canadian-Securities-Exchange-CSE?id=201731 ‚ÄúSince Toronto has become the world financial center for cannabis and cannabinoid pharma-related financings, it became clear that a Canadian stock market listing would be beneficial for INTIVA in potentially accessing capital from global investors and developing increased trading activity of the Company's shares.""



Nexien BioPharma (OTC QB: NXEN) has 200,000,000 Authorized Shares and 43,880,896 Outstanding. The float, as of October 24th, 2018 is 1,499,026. That‚Äôs a very, very small float. As of July 27, 2018, NXEN (formerly NTVA) has a Market Cap of only $16.6 million (at 38¬¢). You can check out OTCmarkets.com for more information.
First, INTIVA BioPharma has a nice management¬†and director line-up:
* Alain Bankier / CEO, Chief Strategist¬†‚Äì If you simply Google his name, you‚Äôll see he‚Äôs been a part of various Cannabis industry events ‚Äî like Canna Tech, Cannabis Learn Conference &amp; Expo, and the Cannabis World Congress &amp; Business Exposition in New York. You can watch/listen to an interview he did with PotBotics. Alan Brochstein from New Cannabis Ventures wrote an article in January 2017 where it started with, ‚ÄúWell-known cannabis investor‚Äù. It goes on to talk about his involvement (co-founder) with New York Angels, which has more than $100 million invested in more than 200 ventures. He‚Äôs the Co-Founder and Managing Director of VS Tech Ventures, which was ‚Äúcreated as an¬†innovative program providing legal cannabis companies access to leading professional service providers, to help entrepreneurs build their businesses, in a cash efficient fashion and to help accelerate company traction, while continually increasing shareholder value‚Äù. Mr. Bankier is also an Advisor to New Frontier Data, whose¬†‚Äúmission is to elevate the discussion around the legal cannabis industry globally by providing unbiased vetted information and educating stakeholders to make informed decisions.‚Äù Mr. Bankier owns more than 2.25 million shares of NTVA, according to the S-1 filed/amended on June 19, 2018.
* Kevin McGovern / Advisor, Director ‚Äì¬†Mr. McGovern was a founder of SoBe Beverages, which most of you should recognize ‚Äî they sold to PepsiCo in 2000 to $370 million. Mr. McGovern is the Chairman &amp; CEO of McGovern Capital, which even lists the Intiva logo on their website under Investments.¬†On the McGovern Capital website it mentions that Kevin has co-founded (through McGovern Capital and its affiliates) more than 25 companies ‚Äî 6 of which have become world/category leaders! ‚ÄúMcGovern Capital, LLC‚Äù owns 751,113 shares of NTVA,¬†according to the S-1 filed/amended on June 19, 2018.
* Lindy Snider / Advisor, Director ‚Äì Ms. Snider is the Founder and CEO of ‚ÄòLindi Skin‚Äô, which is Specialty Skin Care for Cancer Patients. Watch her interview with PotBotics, as she discusses Cannabis investments.¬†Ms. Snider is a dedicated philanthropist and she is an active board member of many non-profit organizations: Fox Chase Cancer Foundation, Cancer Forward, The Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation, The Snider Foundation, to name a few. Lindy is the daughter of the late Ed Snider, the owner of the NHL‚Äôs Philadelphia Flyers, who had a net worth of $2.5 billion according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. Ms. Snider is also a Director of Kanativa, a privately-held Canadian corporation which is involved with Alexa‚Äôs Botanicals ‚Äî who has a line of CBD products. Lindy was said to have 440,000 shares as of the S-1 filing.

        Beyond the successful people that are running the show, it‚Äôs important to point out that NTVA¬†does not ‚Äútouch the plant,‚Äù or any derivatives of the plant. They are proceeding with its research and development activities using U.S. Food and Drug Administration (‚ÄúFDA‚Äù) approved protocols, using the synthetic cannabinoid molecules, Dronabinol and Marinol.
NTVA‚Äôs drug development strategy consists of:
* The acute treatment during exposure to organophosphorus nerve agents, including sarin gas. (This could be a big deal for the Middle East, where we hear about ‚ÄòChemical Warfare‚Äò more commonly. Most recently in Syria.)
* The treatment of various symptoms related to myotonic and muscular diseases such as dystrophia diseases.
* The treatment of¬† various symptoms related to lipidosis, which are genetic disorders which are characterized by defects of the digestive system that impair the way the body uses dietary fat.
* The treatment of¬† various symptoms related to lipofuscinosis, in particular neural ceroid lipofuscinosis and macular degeneration associated with lipofuscinosis, which is any disorder associated with the abnormal storage of lipofuscins. Lipofuscins is a yellow to brownish pigment granule found in the muscle, heart, liver, kidney, adrenal, retina and nerve cells undergoing slow regressive changes and accumulating in lysosomes with age.
* The treatment of restless legs syndrome. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) otherwise known as Willis-Ekbom Disease and Wittmaack-Ekbom Syndrome is a term used to describe a neurological sensory disorder that also interferes with sleep and is thus also considered a sleep disorder. RLS may affect up to 8% of the population, according to Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation.
* Sexual health affecting both males and females. Male sexual health issues or dysfunction issues include male erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders, such as premature ejaculation, anorgasmia (inability to achieve orgasm) and desire disorders such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (lack of interest in sex). Female sexual health issues or dysfunction issues can be defined as the difficulty or inability of a woman to find satisfaction in sexual expression.
To catch you up to speed on what was announced in the last month:
* On June 28, 2018, NTVA announced it has filed a utility patent application with the US Patent Office ‚Äúrelating to the use of cannabinoids to treat myotonia, myotonic dystrophy and other related dystrophies‚Äù.
* On July 12, 2018, NTVA announced Germany-based Dr. Benedikt Schoser as an Advisor.¬†Dr. Schoser is said to be one of the world‚Äôs top researchers in both molecular mechanisms of muscle loss and myotonic dystrophy.
* On July 19, 2018, NTVA was upgraded to the OTC QB Venture Market, which the company said ‚Äúis a reflection of our ongoing objective to provide additional visibility and credibility to the investment community,¬†as we continue to build INTIVA BioPharma to advance the science of cannabinoid-based and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-compliant medicine.‚Äù

 I'm not so sure this would be considered a RPG since dialogue is not really branching and there's no ""skill trees"" to choose from to upgrade your character. I do appreciate inclusion if it's done right but I would have to agree with what a lot of others are saying here and that is it would honestly feel shoehorned in. There would be 0 availability for say, sleeping with another male because firstly, prostitutes were all female and secondly if you did have the opportunity to like, make your relationship with a certain character go up, I think they would have said there's an ""affection"" or whatever meter with other characters similar to another game which I can't remember right now fuck..  


Anyways, from my understanding of the game, Arthur isn't exactly *your* Arthur exactly, he's just either good or bad based on if you kill people more or if you help people more, it's all contextual vs having set dialogue options. I just can't see them making him bi. No problems if he is, but I will have a problem if it doesn't further him as a character in the game. Just knowing a fact about someone does nothing for me, having it shown is better than just ""Hey here's a fun fact lol."" Just my thoughts on the matter."

"Not just social media but the internet and online communication in general too, in my opinion.

Being socially isolated is easier and more rewarding than it has ever been because we can stay at home and use the internet and play video games to satisfy and engage ourselves in ways that weren‚Äôt previously available without going outside and socialising.

Because of this I think a larger proportion of young people are growing up never really making friends and never really learning how to communicate and socialise with their peers in real life situations past childhood.

It‚Äôs not that we never had kids who were lonely and felt like outcasts and who struggled to develop social skills in the past, but I think it is becoming more common because if you do find yourself having difficulty with any of those things instead it‚Äôs easier to just check out and only talk to people on the internet than to go through the learning process."

My Ortho can tell by the direction and range of motion what is generally going on, and can give very specific advice on what to do and not to do. I'm not a doctor, but seeing one (if insurance isn't an issue) is worth the visit. My daughter is a dancer and has had multiple injuries and we don't hesitate to take her somewhere because they know immediately hot to first get the pain down, second deal with inflammation, and third know if they should take an image and look for serious damage. She will be far better off than I.

I know $ is an issue, I don't know your co-pay. i have a lot of leeway and now that I'm 50, things don't heal like 20. But at 20, I had tennis and baseball injuries and never saw a doctor. And they just add up, don't heal right.

"&gt; If you pick a ""bad"" fight and you win because of your superior execution and engage tools is it really bad?

I define a bad fight as a fight that would be lost at a higher chance if all participants executed it perfectly. You can obviousl win bad fights, but its obviously the better choice to take mostly advantageous fights, while it kinda seems that many teams basically take almost every fight als long as they can and this is essentially what the LPL has been mocked for several years.

It can obviously be the right thing to pick a bad fight, for example when you are the superior team at executing theses fights, this is what SKT, EDG, TSM or G2 did in the past, when they were superior at teamfighting and won fights despite beeing down in gold and haven't hit their champions powerspikes, or if you are so far behind, that you would most certainly lose if the other team gets baron or elder. 

I can't answer why korean teams weren't able to adapt, I mean, its pretty obvious for Gen.G, cuz it was the polar opposite of their identity, but I actually expected AF to perform way bettern bo5 than in bo1 and they failed to show. I also think that ppl disrespect KT. They, IG and FNC have been the best performing teams so far at worlds imo, followed, by EDG, C9, RNG and G2."

"Good lord this software is shit. 
I'm a sys admin for a small firm, so I wear lots of hats including figuring out why software x from some random one man team in the everglades wont install and making it install anyway.  We have a surprisingly large number of programs that are little one offs, including things from long gone era's like 16 bit software and things that will only run under windows xp etc etc.  

Usually its mundane, the most common is permissions are not set during install to what they need to be to run  for non admin users.  Sometimes its more exciting like figuring out what dependencies the software has that isn't already installed (.net 3.x or .net 4.x).  Can't install from this location, have to run once after install as admin, blah blah blah.  

This bad boy, I've installed, uninstalled, deleted every existing input driver I could find, run as admin even though I am admin, run from safe mode, purge registry of all things logitech, and so on and so forth, and nothing.  

In the worst case it just spins on install and never finishes, on best case it craters right after install with ""Logioptions.exe has stopped working"" round and round and round.

SO I can't get the most out of my shiny new mouse, because logitech like every other damn peripheral company, makes shit software that wouldn't pass a high school programming course, cause they at least require the damn thing run. 

I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful to anyone else that lands here looking for answers, but I can tell you from my side if you're having the same woes as me, none of the following will help.

Clear registry of logitech
safe mode
uninstall of every driver you can think of even non logitech
Uninstall/reinstall
Admin for install even when already an admin
disable all forms of virus protection
entirely disable firewall (yeah thats what you should have to do *eyeroll*) 

Nada zilch nothing.

"It shouldn't. It's been a few years, you didn't call them, and depending on the state, the marajuana could be legal (or going to be), decriminalized, or medical. In those cases, it would be about as taboo as drinking a beer or glass of wine in front of the kid. Perhaps his parents didn't smoke at the time. There's also a lot of false positives. Well, for whatever reason, neglect wasn't found then. But, you are a different person and it's been a few years. He can't exactly claim your using CPS for harassment. Make sure to gather as much evidence as you can, and try to remain calm when speaking with them. I wouldn't necessarily call. I would go, with your evidence.

Get your facts straight and make a list. Days and times if possible. Locations if possible. Even if you can narrow it down to a month. Don't go into anything else but what relates to the child. I understand he may treat his mom like crap, but that doesn't have much to do with the kid. However, the fact that he has custody, but the child is with the mom, that can be a problem. When talking to CPS, feelings and emotions don't mean much. ""He makes me angry when he..."" ""I think he is verbally abusive..."" ""I feel his living in the car is...""

You need examples as specific as possible. ""My son told me in June that his father said..."" ""When I took my son to the doctor in September, my husband irresponsibly cared for him..."" Saying ""My son's exima (sic) is a result of his neglect,"" is not a sign of abuse. You need the doctor to write a report that the exima (sic) is because of something very specific that is being done wrong in the home. Gather screenshots and anything else you have.

Him not paying child support is not abuse or neglect."

"The good thing is that your story sounds, at least decent, especially when compared to some of the couples I know.

Sounds like you and the Mrs. wanted to get married too.  I've feel like most of the married couples I know, did it ""because it was what you did"", not ""because we absolutely loved each other"".  More like it was something to do, so they did it.

Good food for thought about not wanting a baby after 40 - I'm past 30, and I do not want children.  The good news is that if I ever change my mind, I'll make sure I have enough money to adopt.  Still, I haven't really gotten to live how I want to live - I want to be able to go anywhere, and do anything.  I have not had the chance to do that yet.  I haven't even been out of the US except for a small trip to Canada.  Haven't had a chance to wring a whole lot of fun out of life yet, besides playing video games and hoping I get to pursue a whole lot of dreams that, in all honestly, I'm terrified I won't get to chase.  What would've been the point of busting my ass in college, and working on a career, if I don't get the chance to do any of the fun things I want to do?  That's the POINT (in my opinion) of getting a good education/good job."

"From the perspectives of the Religion it is because God said so and no other explanation is required.

If you assume that there are no Gods and religions are just mans way to deal with the pointless futility of life and its unbearable pains, as I do, then it probably comes down to the fact that suicidal feelings are not uncommon in humans and that like many mental health episodes they will fade in and fade out as whatever process is taking place runs it's course. However, unlike the urge to stay in the cave all day, the urge to threw oneself in front of a herd of Mammoths or wander around with your eyes closed down in Tiger Valley might well lead to fatality and an inability to then move into a more positive phase of your life.

So suicide is something people need to protect other people from. Suicidal people can often lead long productive happy lives. Suicidal people can, if they dont suicide, contribute to the community. Suicidal people are often VERY pleased that they were prevented from killing themselves, as least for much of their lives, if not all of it.

So I'd suggest the proscriptions from committing suicide is merely there to help both the individual, their family, and the community itself from losing potentially valuable individuals. Most religions run a set of rules that mimic those required to run stable safe communities and preventing unnecessary loss of life is one of them"

"I have no idea if i have OCD or what but I know that I have ADHD-C (since 3 years old) and I've started noticing I do a lot of things over and over again.

I'll constantly re-lock my car and turn around having walked about 5 metres away just to be VERY sure it's locked and even then as I walk away i'll keep pressing the lock button and checking the lights flash when it locks and making sure that the noise it makes means the door is actually locked.

I HAVE to have my closet doors closed before I go to bed otherwise I feel really uncomfortable. I always have to choose the specific size fork and specific shaped spoon (not the soup spoons) when I eat anything because I don't ""like""' them. 

When I was a lot younger I used to do weird things like turn in a circle a specific amount of times or bend my head at random intervals. Even now I still have tics from when I was younger.

These are small things and by no means rule over my life in any ways (thankfully), but does this sound symptomatic of OCD or is it just a manifestation of ADHD/ADD and being on the spectrum because of it. Never been sure."

Starforce is a similar series to battle network and its even the same universe, but far in the future after battle network, and is also on DS.   

I was able to get a legit copy of battle network 5 for DS through amazon.   Dont know where you could get a copy of the starforce games though.

If you cant find any of these then you could go to gamestops website and buy a gameboy advance (~$80, i bought one a week ago from them) and pick up the battle network games from their website too (i got battle network 3: blue and 4: red sun from them.  Both were less than $10).  They dont have ALL the battle network games (i wanted 4: blue moon but they didnt have it, so i got 4: red sun instead) "

"&gt; Getting to Endgame

&gt;Okay. So I have some bad news on this one. FFXIV is a game where the developers want you to experience the expansions as originally as intended (with the slight exception of the speed with which you level).

&gt;Unfortunately, because the game was designed in certain ways back in the day, those design choices, as limiting as they are, are 100% still present and you 100% have to deal with them. If you want to experience the story from the beginning, you will spend a VERY long time doing the Main Story Quest from the original rerelease (A Realm Reborn). The MSQ starting at level 50 takes a very, very long time and if you actually want to experience the story, you will have to do it. You will likely greatly outlevel the content as a result. But you'll have to do it. Sorry.

It's worth mentioning here that you *can* boost your character, sort of like in wow, but there are a lot of caveats:

* Boosting through the story and boosting your job (class) level are separate purchases. Since you can level all jobs on one character, this does make sense - but it raises the price to catch up by paying.
* If you buy a story boost, you can never go back and experience the story as intended. You will need to roll a fresh character to do so. You can watch cutscenes in video format, but you will miss out on a lot of context for the story once you catch up.
* If you buy one boost without the other, things get weird. Either you'll need to do the entire story as a downscaled level 60 character (weird and not really beneficial), or you'll have to level without doing the story (weird, slow and pointless). If you aren't going to boost both, don't boost either.
* If you boost, you won't be able to immediately join your friends at endgame. Like WoW, you'll need to earn the last ten levels normally. Unlike WoW, you'll also need to do a shitton of story from the expansion and its patches.
* If you don't boost, you can't play with your friends at endgame until you catch up, but they absolutely CAN play with you. Going through the story is a pretty solo affair, but every so often you'll need to do dungeons (4 mans) or trials (8 mans) to progress. Your higher level friends or guildies can help you with those, and their levels will be downscaled so it won't be a total cakewalk. Most of a cakewalk, but not a total one. 
* If you don't have high lvl friends, don't worry - tons of players use the dungeon roulette, so when you use the ""duty finder"" (automated party finder), they'll get thrown in with you. 
* If you do boost, take some time to figure out what features/dungeons/extras don't get automatically unlocked for you. There are [progression unlock guides](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Guide:Progression_and_Level_Locked_Content) you can use to help figure that out. 

I'd personally recommend playing the game as intended. The story is pretty good, especially in Heavensward and beyond. You learn the ropes and unlock things as you go. It's not super confusing. But if you're desperate to catch up with folks, boosting is a nice option to have. And job boosting is a pretty convenient way to level alt jobs - most of learning how to play your class properly happens at max level, anyways."

"In Zak context, Bishop is already top tier with good AoE such as Big Bang.

With level 151 hyper skill, you will get a passive 40 % matk buff and the desperately needed single target capability.

Furthermore, you will get buffed with Adv. Blessing hyper skills and also with infinity. Plus the HS exp buff, Bishop will be upgraded from ""in demand"" to ""saved one slot for BS"" for party play.

Heaven's Door brings in additional utility together with good damage. 

Higher level expeditions (Cygnus) will see Bishop as needed party staple, even if you don't as much DPS compared to NL, Bishop will still be relevant because we play the role of buffing others to a higher height.

Word wise, a bishop is a follower of Christ, and there is no greater joy than giving to others.

"&gt; By '93 she had paid $1200 to rent a phone that was already obsolete when she moved in. My boyfriend at the time was having exactly the same conversation with his parents with exactly as little success.

*edit* 

To explain more fully it was 1980 when I first questioned renting that phone. Had seen a display of telephones for sale and checked out the pricing on the different models. After I realized the lower end models cost half what she was paying annually I brought it to her attention and suggested she make the change. She thought I didn't understand phone jacks. She claimed it would cost $100 to hire an electrician--which was probably a number she pulled out of the air. When I replied that would still pay for itself in a couple of years she first replied about the repair portion of the rental contract, then responded that the wall would have to be patched and repainted after the old phone got taken out. At age twelve I didn't know how much the painting and plastering would cost so I let the matter drop. Hardly anyone owned an answering machine in 1980 and any business you called would have a human being answer the phone. So a rotary phone wasn't at much disadvantage in terms of functionality.

By '93 nearly everyone had an answering machine, it was becoming a chore to call businesses if you couldn't do touch tone dialing, and I was competent at all the relevant handiwork. Also had enough life experience to know that our phone was no fluke: most telephones were reliable without service or maintenance."

"To add onto this, whenever I go to a gig or a bar/pub, I can immediately tell which girls are 18 and under, and which are older.

"What specifically? The point was that The Director had limited information initially because of the lack of tech/cameras in the area.

The Director doesn't have direct control or contact with the travelers. With the limited info The Director kept sending additional travelers in a desperate hope they would succeed knowing the ways that had already failed.

There's a couple answers (they're all NHL hockey players!), but in this case, it's relevant that every single one of them is 35th or higher in the all-time NHL goals list, and every single one of them *never* had a 55 goal season.

&amp;#x200B;

No offense to DeBrincat, who is a good goal scorer, but 55 goals in a single season is an incredibly high bar and in the modern NHL it's an even higher bar than it was in 1997. Like I said in the post you responded to, only 6 times in the last 20 years has a player had 55 or better in a season -- and those six seasons are represented by only four players. Alex Ovechkin has hit 55 *twice*, and he's been by far the best goal scorer in the league for the last ten years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even for the best goal scorers in the league, you need to be having the season of your life to score 55 -- "

"In general, I disagree. And I don‚Äôt think it comes down to the people as much as the politics they advocate for. Progressivism today aims to create a world that is beneficial to all that live in it. It strives for equality, equity, and reparations to societies most mistreated groups. In really simple terms, a lot of leftist ideals are aligned with peace, love, equality, and respect. 

I‚Äôm not saying there aren‚Äôt people on the right that feel this very same way, many do. And that is where disagreements can be had without hating each other. But the reality is, the vast majority of our public (across political lines) are increasingly uneducated, poor, and unequal. That makes it incredibly hard to be a good, well informed virtuous citizen. The left tends to be more educated on average, and seeing the right revert to the politics they are, it‚Äôs obvious many right wing politicians are taking advantage of their base. This polarization is entirely strategy to them, and our foreign adversaries. Their platforms are based on fear, identity, and polarization. They‚Äôve taken control of American democracy and are steamrolling policy that hurts their constituents and benefits those at the top. 

The left and the right are mad at the same thing. I‚Äôm not saying the left is perfect, but their coalition is FAR more under control by its actual voters. Not industry, lobbyists, religions, and foreign powers. The right, who has overwhelming power in Washington right now, uses hate and and fear to drive a wedge between us. Think about it, republicans have a majority in every branch of government. Why are right wing voters still upset? They‚Äôve had an entire year to do nearly whatever they want. What‚Äôs changed? Even if the left is a screaming mob, who cares when if good honest people are in power? 

It‚Äôs not about policy. It‚Äôs not about the people. It‚Äôs about the narrative that our country is in danger from liberal yahoos who want to take away all our rights and freedoms and give them to crime ridden immigrants. It‚Äôs fear. It‚Äôs hate for the ‚Äúother‚Äù the ‚Äúpoliticians.‚Äù Give me a right that debates policy, realistic views on immigration reform, gun control, health care, national debt, etc. Give me a right that doesn‚Äôt revert to hating liberals and offers real solutions that democrats do, then I‚Äôm fine. But that doesn‚Äôt happen. 

Again, the left isn‚Äôt perfect at this either. But they are much better. The left wants change to better everyone. The right wants to stop that change in its tracks. "

"&gt;The bombs ‚Äî like the explosive device that was found Monday in the mailbox of George Soros' home in Bedford, New York ‚Äî were all made with PVC pipe, which X-rays indicated likely contained shrapnel, three senior law enforcement officials with direct knowledge of the matter told NBC News. They included a low explosive or a pyrotechnic, as in fireworks, as well as timers ‚Äî likely digital alarm clocks ‚Äî to set off the detonators, the sources said.
&gt;Multiple senior bomb technicians briefed on the case said the aspiring bomber had all of the components needed to set off a successful explosion.

There was this one job where I was scheduled for a 12 hour shift and then as I was leaving for it, the boss started screaming at me that I can't leave yet. I yelled right back that my scheduled shift was over and left anyway...

*Suddenly the door to the bar opens, and Dennis strides in, a smug look on his face*

**Dennis:** Hello, peasants.

**Dee, Mac, Frank, and Charlie:** Ey [Uninterested].

**Dennis:** Why so unenthused?

**Frank:** We're busy [Not looking up].

**Dennis:** What could you possibly be interested in that's more important than me?

**Dee:** More stuck up than usual today?

**Dennis:** Sorry, gents, but I just made the news.

**Dee:** What, are you the guy who sent those bombs to Obama and Clinton?

**Dennis:** Huh? You heard about that?

**Dee:** Of course I did, it's all over the news. Everywhere.

**Frank:** Someone's standing up to those damned libs with brute force, like we used to in the old days!

**Dee:** How the hell can you defend something like that?

**Frank:** Shut up, bird.

*The rest of the gang laughs*

**Charlie:** Ey, ey, you got her good man! *pats Frank on the back*

**Frank:** *whips out gun* DON'T TOUCH ME! CHARLIE YOU KNOW THIS, DON'T GOD DAMNED TOUCH ME!

**Charlie:** Alright, Alright, I'm sorry man, just sit back down.

**Dennis:** Alright, come one guys, let's not derail the situation.

**Frank:** Why the hell do you care if we stop talking about the bomber guy?

**Dennis:** Well, I was just wondering, what if you got his motive wrong?

**Frank:** Eh?

**Dee:** What the hell are you on about?

**Dennis:** Well, what if he didn't send the bombs to Obama and Clinton because they were Democrats? What if he just wanted to make a statement, to assert his dominance over politics? Would that be so insane?

**Dee:** Why would he just send them to Democrats then?

**Dennis:** Flip of a coin. Just like that. It had to be to one party, and God chose it by chance.

*The gang looks awkwardly at Dennis*

**Dennis:** That's what I think, at least.

"My ex and I bought 2 sugar gliders many, many years ago. When we got home and tried to put them into their cage, both escaped and we kept rearranging furniture trying to capture both of them. Hours spent trying to catch them... Whatever. They were cute. Samson and Delilah, we names them. Shortly after Delilah got pregnant and they wouldn't let is touch either of them because they'd try and bite, scratch, chatter like crazy. She had the baby who we just called Sugar. From then on, we heard nonstop barking and chattering. We couldn't handle them after a couple of weeks. Maybe they just didn't get along anymore or something,  but the barking was so loud from both and eventually Sugar started making the same noises. After a while we gave up and gave them away for free. 

Would never buy them again. Cute little things to look at and them leave."

"Anyone have a link to the book like an Amazon page to buy it (Neuromancer) or such and other recommendations for Cyberpunk style media?

I'm quite new to Cyberpunk; I'm trying to research about how it's portrayed in fictional works as I'm building a world for a heavily modified Dungeons and Dragons campaign focusing on it (technically, Pathfinder, and I'm aware that for Cyberpunk specifically there's probably a better system out there maybe Shadowrun with a little modifications, but I'm sticking with Pathfinder for familiarity and Cyberpunk is only part of the world---the other parts are Steampunk and Magitech, which I'm separately doing research on.).

"The SX8200 comes with an aluminum heatspreader that probably helps a little bit, but is optional. On my EX920 I cooled the controller with a [copper BGA ramsink](http://ssd.borecraft.com/photos/ex920_sink.png) and thermal tape (see photo in link). These controllers are dual-core ARM-based affairs so anything that would work on say, a Raspberry Pi 3, would be fine. Generally there is no need to cool the DRAM or NAND.

Most of these controllers are made to operate up to 70C (they can get much hotter, but this is where they throttle). My SX8200, which is in a PCIe adapter in my 2nd GPU slot beneath my GTX 1080, has reached a maximum temperature of 46C using the aluminum heatspreader. The EX920 is in the M.2 motherboard socket beneath the GTX 1080 so definitely gets warmer; with my heatsink it has hit a maximum temperature of 53C. I've done sustained writes on both past even the SLC cache so these should be realistic values for someone with a full tower and decent air cooling.

Note that aftermarket coolers are often made for single-sided drives and may require modification for dual-sided ones like these. Heatsinks that come with a motherboard should be okay at this point (there was a bit of a fiasco with a MSI in the past). "

"Even given equal treatment, though, trans men are still an absolutely minuscule percentage of the population. And it's not the job of any specific film to sacrifice potential box office and draw in order to promote inclusion. 

&gt;Plus the movie cynic in me thinks most of these roles that go to big names (specifically GitS) aren't exactly challenging roles, and they are in average films. Throwing the unrecognised a bone might help those films actually breakout by giving viewers something new to see and something to talk about.

"How much of it did he agree to pay?  That is, when he went and got the suit, did he say anything that could either be taken as agreeing with the cost, or anything indicating that he couldn't pay/wouldn't pay?

Are there any other *bills* that he had agreed to pay for or contribute money towards?  Not gifts, invitations, dinners, etc.

Ultimately, you would need to sue him for the cost of the suit/accessories in order to get repaid. TN's small claims limit is $25,000, so you should be able to file in small claims. It will probably come down to how much of a verbal contract or agreement you had with him.   It also depends on any arrangements or agreements you had with your ""Suits guy"".  Honestly, there's so many ifs, maybes, dependings, etc, that you may want to run all this by a lawyer first to see if you actually have grounds to sue him.

Literally, I‚Äôm not even trying to argue or anything like that but you have a very skewed opinion on this that is not representative of reality.

"This is why I loved the Mental Hospital angle in 1999.

It was the natural, logical progression of Flair's character.

He wrestled all over the world in the 80s, defeating all challengers, men and women, all while drinking and partying.

The earliest sign of Flair cracking mentally happened in 1990 when he became the Black Scorpion.

In 1994, he became obsessed with destroying Hogan. He dressed in drag to attack Hogan. In the above gif, he's snapped even further, posing as a corpse in an obvious ruse.

In 1997, his friend Curt Hennig betrays him. His best friend retires and is then mocked - by Hogan's crew, no less.

In 1998, his employer attacks him. Sues him. He has a heart attac... no, his boss poisoned his food.

Who can blame the guy for finally cracking in 1999? Him paying off Charles Robinson made sense. He finally screwed over Hogan. His years of hard work and excess crippled him. He cracked."

"I think you're misconstruing or missing my points, which is creating ""a severe misunderstanding.""

1. No, the boxing out player *is* initiating contact by slowing down (see: taking an unavoidable position). By the literal rules, that's a foul. That was my point. 

2. Bumping shoulders is an offsetting foul *every* time if we're being literal, which is also my point.

3. The thrower moves his toe on his initial pivot, which is the only point of contact maintained on the buck, so that is a literal travel.

Regarding discussions, people bandy phrases that are not in rulebook a bunch when making these plays, like any of the adjectives the person who I was responding to originally used about aggression and intent. ""Didn't affect the play"" is what incidental means, that is the USAU rule, but still: the Spirit of the Game that I play and have always played is NOT that all intentional contact regardless of anything else is a foul. But it's played differently around the world and at different skill levels, so there's always wiggle room. Which, again and finally, is my point. The way people use and interpret the rules answers whether something is a foul *moreso* than the letter of the rulebook."

And so when my mother passed away weeks later, there was no surprise - no feeling of betrayal that ‚ÄúDad said it would be okay but it wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù  
Instead I said, ‚ÄúNana passed away today‚Äù.  

And she said ‚ÄúI will miss her, Dad‚Äù.  

And I said, ‚Äúme too, kiddo, me too.‚Äù

Kids need to know that they can trust their parents, man.  Sure giving them hope is fine.  But it‚Äôs also okay to just say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù when we don‚Äôt know.

"It basically means that planet is the head honcho and all other planets answer to it. So the condition of your Pluto and transits to it (and progressions of it) will affect all other planets in your chart. It is a strong position and therefore Plutonian themes will carry on in your life. Pluto is the *final* dispositor, meaning that when you break apart the chain, the one on one relationships between planets also give clues to your character. Maybe on the way to Pluto, your Mars is disposed by Venus--and that would matter. But on a broad scale, Pluto runs the show. It is important when looking to how certain events unfold.

Is your Pluto in Scorpio? I guess that's your only domicile placement. It's a generational aspect so that also gives relevance to how your generation of people will live and impart legacy.

My final dispositor is Saturn--so everything in my life is slow and tempered, done with caution and integrity. Big time anxiety, fear, and depression running the show. Big time restricted and walled off.

I had a reading recently wherein the Astrologer made final dispositor Saturn akin to, like, a rich uncle who has money in offshore bank accounts who will eventually leave an inheritance. The promises of riches or success is there, but I can't touch it or see it right now, so it seems nonexistent. So I often feel like a late bloomer, working hard and long but never achieving a critical mass of success. But after my Saturn Return that'll change. Hoping anyway...

"Call me crazy, and you'll be correct, but I've had a subtle love of parasitic insects for a while. 

Fleas, and lice for that matter, are often very host specific. For example the fleas that infest Foxes Coyotes, Wolves, and Domestic Dogs, all come from the same common ancestor, and all these fleas can feed on any animal they choose, but subtle evolutionary changes means that any of those fleas can only reproduce on its host animals. IE; Wolf fleas can only reproduce on wolves, and not a coyote or domestic dog. 

Anyways, rat fleas carry the plague and while they can bite and live on human hosts they don't reproduce on humans, and human fleas which are their own unique species don't carry said plague. It was certainly the rats, and their fleas that spread the plague. And it's worth considering that one of the reasons it became less prevalent in latter times is that the Black Rat was succeeded by the Norwegian Rat (which doesn't come from Norway) and while both rat (flea) species carries the plague only the Black Rat has frequent contact with humans. 

You're partly correct in that it wasn't necessarily the rats themselves that spread, rat fleas have developed that ability to live in grain stores, sans rats, and spread by the transportation of grain to the awaiting rats at the destination. 

If you've read this far, here's some more cool parasitic insect facts. Body lice evolved ~100,000 years ago, and are certainly a evolutionary ancestor of head lice. They are a difference species from head lice, and require clothing to reproduce so it's about the only evidence we have of when humans started to habitually wear clothes since it doesn't fossilize. Pubic lice (craps) are an ancestor of Gorilla Lice, and started to infect humans through either nest sharing or butchery. It's so specialized that it can only reproduce on human pubic, or eye-brow hair. "

"That's what happened in the story, the opponent looked at his hand and chose a card to be shuffled into the deck. Pretty sure he even said it was a GRV. They couldn't change the top card because the top card had already been drawn, and there was no way for the judge or opponent to determine which card in marshall's hand was not supposed to be there.

&gt;Even though I suppose a shuffle could be better for you with a deck like Miracles

Note that the judge only used that fix because the order of the deck was unknown, so shuffling it restores it to a randomized state, like it was before the illegal action was took. If the deck was not fully randomized (due to a scry, miracles shenanigans, etc.) then the judge would use a different fix."

"You shouldn't depend on spirulina to give you sufficient B12.  Spirulina does not have reliable amounts of B12 unless it is fortified with B12.  

There is no plant source of B12 that we should consider reliable; however, there is a vegan source: bacteria.  We can grow B12-producing bacteria in fermentation vats (similar to the way beer or wine is fermented), by feeding them and taking the B12 they produce, and adding it either to supplements or to foods to make fortified foods.  

Taking supplements or eating fortified foods is not a bad thing.  Fortifying different foods by adding vitamins and minerals we tend to find difficult to get is not a bad thing, because it prevents deficiency.  The diets of many people (including omnviores) are already being fortified, and that has helped us, not hurt us (it has *reduced* the amount of deficiency-related diseases, like rickets, scurvy, beriberi, etc., in the world).  

If you want to know why algae products should not be considered reliable sources of B12 (unless they are specifically fortified with B12), see these comments:

"Hey, Jerry_Cola. Unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):

* Often when the subreddit sees a large volume of traffic and/or posts - like when news is released - the rules are enforced more strictly than when the subreddit is quieter. If your post was removed for Rule 4, it's likely because there are a lot of posts being made and we want to make sure higher-quality posts aren't buried.

"Depends on where you play to end up with it. If you're playing for only PvE, you can go up to as high as sl300 and use a 60/60 int/fai build and use the catalysts that scale with both. If you're playing PvP, chances are you don't want to use any int unless you're making a dark miracle-only build, which is usually 40/40 with the sunless talisman.

The catalyst depends. Use http://soulsplanner.com/darksouls3 to compare the spell buffs (you may have to click on the AR to switch to spell buff) and see which works best. For dark spells though, ""dark"" catalysts work best though, so keep that in mind. You should also consider the weapon arts of them. Chimes heal over time, talismen poise cast, to varying degrees of efficiency, let me know if you want the breakdown on that.

Pretty much any lightning-infused that you have the req stats for. Be sure to make your ""faith-only"" weapons though, like the bident. Strength faith also gets lots of choices, like the DS-Gaxe, rose of ariendal, or dare I say, Wolnir's.

"Most of the mob's Hollywood influence in the 30's and 40's was over b-list studios like Eagle Lion (where John Roselli was a silent partner) and Columbia. The William Bioff, George Browne trial which ultimately sent Roselli to prison ended most of that. It was mostly stage hand union control. When Roselli got out of prison he went to Vegas and left LA alone. By this time LAPD Chief Willie Parker was cracking down heavily on organized crime, and most of the syndicate began to only operate in LA and Hollywood on a covert level through lawyers like Sidney Korshak. The actual LA family was in upheaval throughout this time and only controlled small gambling operations and drugs. Mickey Cohen ran his own book and didn't even kick up to the LA family, even though he was supposed to. LA was a mess after the heyday of the 30's and 40s. 

Bugsy Siegel's control in Hollywood was mainly through childhood friend George Raft. He had some inside union connections but most of his rackets in show biz involved borrowing money from famous actors and never paying them back. Siegel was sent to LA to combine the betting wire services and control them ostensibly with LA boss Jack Dragna. Of course they really had no intention of letting Dragna make decisions they just let him think he was in charge because LA was his turf by rule. Siegel too got tired of dealing with LA's police and set his sights on Vegas. He took the Flamingo project over from Billy Wilkerson with syndicate cash and the rest is history. "

"It literally requires less pressure to pick/press the fret because the string is looser compared to a standard-tuned string. That‚Äôs physics 101. The fact that so many people cannot realize this blows my mind. 

It requires less pressure to displace a guitar string if the string is loose aka tuned lower. For example, imagine there‚Äôs a hammock strung between two trees. If the hammock is really tight and you sit in it, the hammock will lower but not by much; maybe 6-12 inches. It would also be difficult to sway the hammock back and forth. Now. if you loosen the hammock and sit in it, it‚Äôs going to drop much lower than if it were tight. It will also sway much more because the tension on the hammock is much lower. Make sense? "
"&gt;Any reference to the Mgtwo subreddit is invalid. It does not in any way represent the beliefs of MGTOW in general.

I'm going to have to stop you right there. I know of the sub and the website. Those are the two major forums I've seen for MGTOW thought. I do not know of any larger forum for their ideas. I realize not everyone that identifies as MGTOW is going to agree with those communities. But when judging MGTOW in general, I'm going to use the largest communities of them. That's pretty fair in my opinion. They become popular for a reason. 

I'm certainly not going to let you put a crown on and proclaim yourself the king of the MGTOWs. If you want, I can dig through the website to show examples of similar hated. Or you can share a major MGTOW community that I've missed. Maybe you know of another major community or outlet that isn't do hateful. But until I see one, I'm inclined to use the sub as a means to judge them."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

This started around 3 years ago, I was in college as a freshman and made friends with this guy (We will call him ‚ÄúN‚Äù). Fast forward a few months, we were practically hanging out everyday became really good friends during this time I learned he was one of the ‚ÄúWhite-Knight‚Äù types of dude. 

Fast forward towards the middle of the semester N started talking to one of his co-workers where he worked (we will call her ‚ÄúM‚Äù). I thought they made a good couple from the way he told me they hung out a lot. He even mentioned how they had sex and tried to describe it like it would make him ‚Äúcool‚Äù. I really didn‚Äôt think much of it, so what I was dating someone at the time.

Fast forward towards the end of the Semester, I ended up dropping out of College, for a business I started when I was 16 (web design online marketing, I know stupid, it started kicking off when a business lawyer I made a site for recommended me to many of his small business clients) It was a tough choice but plays a key role. At this time I was financially stable and decided to focus 100% on the company, I like to keep thing private and act like I‚Äôm still poor . 

It started when this girl asked me to go to our universities dance, I went strictly as friends and so did N and M. 

Towards the end of the Dance, we were sitting at a table and I mentioned how nice N and M looked, the bomb dropped there. N texted me to not say anything, because they broke up and are just friends for right now. I didn‚Äôt understand it.

Fast forward a few months, M added me on Snapchat via the ‚Äúpeople you may know‚Äù. We didn‚Äôt message each other for a few weeks. 

I put on my story if anyone wanted to go to lunch, because I was downtown and had time to kill. M messaged me and we met up, we kicked it off and she asked me if I wanted to see a movie later, I did, but there was nothing romantic. 

After our ‚Äúnot-date‚Äù I had messaged N (who was still my good friend at the time), would he be comfortable if I started dating his ex (keep in mind it was months after they broke up).

He messaged me angry, that they were still friends that was uncalled for and if I was his friend I wouldn‚Äôt have even consider it.

I thought he was right so I apologized and just completely ghosted M. 

Fast forward a few weeks and M messaged me why I was ghosting her, I told her I respect N and didn‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to her. At that moment everything fell together. 

She told me she only thinks of N as a friend and didn‚Äôt want anything romantic with him. We went out to dinner and there I figured out so much N never actually even dated M they‚Äôre were just coworkers and friends. He was in the friend zone. She claimed N had a crush on her for a while and he would always try to get with her.

I knew this and didn‚Äôt have the guts to call him out. I would feel bad. 

Fast forward a few more months, M and I are dating and N had no clue. We both don‚Äôt put our lives on social media. 

Out of the blue N, texted me about how I‚Äôm an asshole because I knew their background and I was a terrible person. 

I didn‚Äôt react to it, i just told him to calm down and we could talk later. 

Days later he texted M and told her lies about me and tried to make me look as bad as possible.

He blocked me.  I didn‚Äôt hear from him.

The following days my business (which had grown from myself to 8 employees and I was actually making good money.). N flooded my reviews in every platform you can think of with bad ratings, it brought years of good reputation down in days I only knew because his dumbass used his real information right before all the bad reviews came in. I was furious and snapped. 

At this time most of our mutual friends didn‚Äôt know we fighting. I called all of our friends together and exposed him for what he did, how he lied about a girl (even about the story of Fucking her) I showed them all the text he sent to me, to my girlfriend, and trying to business look bad. 

I didn‚Äôt think and even sent the entire story, messages and proof to his dad telling him that N better knock it off before I get lawyers involved as a simple bluff to make him back off. 

I thought that was the end it.

Fast forward about a year, present time I‚Äôm still dating M and they hadn‚Äôt talked since the whole ordeal occurred . 

A few days ago, I was hanging out with a few of my friends I learned that after I told our friends and his parents, N‚Äôs life went downhill. His social life was non-existent and he transferred schools. I guess the story followed him, he attempted suicide and thankfully lived. I guess he dropped out and no one as heard from him since.

Its been a few days and I feel guilty because this started over a girl, I didn‚Äôt know the guy tried to kill himself. He was actually a good friend of mine.

Should I feel guilty about this? Am I the asshole?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

TLDR; 

My friend had a crush, said they were dating. They weren‚Äôt. Crush and I eventually started talking and dating. Friend didn‚Äôt like that and tried to ruin our relationship and my business. I countered by exposing him to our friends and his dad. Years later I learned I ruined his life and became suicidal. AITA?

"I think the fact that fury is op is exactly what happens when the game was 98% the same team but nobody wanted widow nerfed.  What you get instead of the simplest needed fix is the usual power creep cycle instead.  Not that fury isn't ridiculous and saying so isn't a valid complaint, but I will absolutely point out that if the same person had BOTH complaints (nooo don't nerf my widow followed by nooo don't overbuff new characters) they should really change all ringtones on their cell phones to various ""I told you so"" phrases as a form of karmic justice.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that he needs a huge grind and then is strong does indeed offset.  A clearly powerful character SHOULD have a long grind to get.  

The synergy to the point that the whole team is as ridiculous as it is is certainly over the top.  I am assuming that the brotherhood is going to be a shield team killer, at which point you have rock/paper/scissors at least (brotherhood kills shield, shield kills defenders like everything else, but defenders trounces the all villain brotherhood).  

My biggest complaint is sort of number 4, but not exactly as typed.  I don't think anyone is suffering extreme consequences yet in terms of shield teams that have appeared, although anyone who hasn't grabbed fury before punisher was retuned is going to have to buff the kree up waaay more than people who got him ASAP.  If the coming maintenance has anything to do with a kree buff, hypothetically the next Fury event should see Fury become almost common.  Then there would be a point of true agony for anyone who doesn't have him, but only for as long as it takes for brotherhood teams to hit the field (I assume), at which point at least you wouldn't have all the same team at the top you can pick your poison at least."

African Americans for 34%

""Law enforcement agencies reported in 2011 that gangs affiliated with ethnicity and non-traditional gangs have expanded in recent years.""

That's an awful lot of gang affiliation for only 12% of the population

&gt; You are making alot of assumptions based on a bias towards police and quite frankly, based on your wording, against POC.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States#Homicide

""In 2013, number and percentage of murder arrests by race were:

Black or African Americans 4,379 = 51.3%""

That's an awful lot of murder for 12% of the population. 

""Inversely, the percentage of individuals in each racial demographic arrested for murder in 2013 (with 2016 population estimates) was:

0.0102% of Black or African American population (4,379/42,975,959)""

So no, I'm not making assumptions I am stating facts.


&gt; Cops should not get paid time off when they investigate.

Ah yes. Cops who just had to kill someone should also have to worry about their bills while they are investigating.

&gt; If it's in self defence then they can prove it In a court of law in front of a jury of their peers like everyone else.

This is laughable honestly. I trust cops to out their own over a bunch of knuckledraggers who hate cops because they are too stupid to look into situations and they get all their news from fox. 

&gt; There is no context.

Ah you're one of those people. Do you by chance follow Tariq Nasheed?

&gt; There is De-escalate the situation or be prepared to lose your job/go to jail for murder.

You think [most cops don't try to deescalate situations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPRUBEfIStU)? It doesn't always work.

&gt; Cops dont get a free pass on killing someone bc they are targeted

Yes they do, as does everyone. If you feel your life is in danger imminent danger you can kill that person, it's self defense. 

&gt; And even then cops choose their profession.

Yeah, and most of them chose it because they want to help people.

&gt; Cops are targeted because they have abused their power for years with no oversight. 

No they are getting killed because criminals and gangsters don't want to get caught.

&gt; They are getting the repercussions of that.

Ah yes, kill the new cops for what the police did 20+ years ago. Should we go kill all the Germans for what they did in the past?

&gt; End of story.

"Origin is pretty rough from a perspective of socializing, otherwise it gets the job done. Both Steam and Blizzard have done a good job on that end.

"It's also worth noting, though I'm sure you already know this, that the Theme system as it existed in the 9th-10th century didn't exist at all for a huge portion of CKII's period, or even any of it if you don't have any DLC. From around the mid-late 10th century to 1204 the bulk of the Roman army were fully professional standing troops paid by the fisc and not attached to any specific region, not too fundamentally different from the classical legions of the principate really. Thus you have 4000 Roman soldiers stationed permanently in Antioch, for example, a force as large as any raised in, say, contemporary Britain. 

&gt;As for succession, the problem with that is the empire's aristocracy had a tendency to function kind of like a commonwealth. During the 10th century the nobility managed to start gobbling up land in Anatolia and taking it away from the free peasantry (much like the situation in the late Republic, actually). Basil II undid this by forcing through a law revoking every single landowner's acquisitions since about 900 AD. As a result the Nobles after Basil II's reign basically supported whatever emperor would give them land (first by undoing Basil's revocation), and defunded much of the military. 

The whole ""central administration vs landed magnates"" thesis has been coming under *very heavy* scrutiny as of late, and for good reason. It's essentially based on a few pieces of 10th century anti-aristocracy legislation (fitting into a pattern likewise going back to the days of Theodosius), a few scattered anecdotes from Skylitzes, and a whole lot of conjecture and assumption powered by an ideological need within Byzantine studies to fit Byzantine history into medieval narratives of ""feudalization"". 

What we actually see in the 10th-11th century sources - and I should note that I'm drawing heavily on Kaldellis's 2017 ""Streams of Gold, Rivers of Blood"" from here on - doesn't fit this narrative at all, and in many ways actively goes against it. Revolts in the east, such as those of Bardas Phokas and Skleros, are only ever undertaken by acting Roman military officials using the professional Roman soldiers under their command, not independent aristocrats with estate-raised retainers; ""magnate"" emperors such as Nikephoros Phokas and Isaac Komnenos, especially the latter, pass the exact same anti-aristocratic legislation as their Macedonian and civilian counterparts, and give no hint of acting in the interests of some wider ""landed aristocrat"" faction; and ""magnate"" families, such as the Phokades and Skleroi, disappear from the record completely once their revolts have been quashed, presumably having most of their lands confiscated and being excluded from the primary path to wealth: public office. 

Essentially, the picture painted by the sources isn't really fundamentally different from what we see in the rest of Roman history: office holders, civil and military, use the wealth, influence, and resources gained from their position to advance their political interests (and those of their family) *within* the established structures of the Roman state, with the ultimate goal of attaining the highest public office; these office holders were drawn from an educated patrician class with a level of preexisting land-based wealth, but of an amount far, far too small to independently resist state authority, as we see in the impoverishment of clans such as the Phokades and Maleinoi after their exclusion from state office. 

As for the anti-""powerful"" legislation of the 10th and 11th centuries, it shows that at least some free farmers were having their lands bought up by wealthy neighbors (or institutions, such as the Church) in periods of crisis, but this can hardly be taken, on its own, as an indication of wider socio-economic trends, especially considering that there was never a period in Roman history where that *wasn't* the case. The laws, probably more importantly than combating economic forces on the ground, served as a stick with which the emperors could threaten or punish the wealthy for whatever reason, and were thus re-issued periodically by emperors of all origins, even into the Komnenian period.  

&gt;As a result the system of ""commonwealth"" turned from one of promoting strong leaders to replace weak dynastic successors or weak appointed successors, to one of promoting whoever would follow the landed aristocracy's whims. The proper administrative system (including the theme system) began to break down, and Manitzikert simply accelerated that process. The Turks didn't topple the empire in 1071, the empire toppled itself and the Turks moved into the gap.

There was little fundamental difference between the political system of 960 ad and 1068 ad. The administrative system was still very much intact and under state control, the aristocracy was one of service, operating within the confines of Roman state structures, and the military was, if somewhat neglected under the Doukoi, still professional and intact. A competent emperor, such as Romanos IV, could come to the throne and immediately mobilize the full strength of the Roman army and logistical network in sweeping campaigns of reassertion and reconquest across hundreds of miles while leaving the provincial administration to run itself in his absence. Romanos himself fell victim to a combination of bad luck and conspiracy and rivalry within his government and military, a Roman tradition, but even in the political and economic climate of the 1060's he was as free to go on Syrian and Caucasian escapades as a Basil II or Nikephoros Phokas a century earlier. 

Modern historians have an obsession with finding ""deeper"" causes for every event, but it really was Manzikert and its immediate aftermath which broke the back of Roman Anatolia, just as Seljuq invasions broke the back of Buyid Mesopotamia, not esoteric socio-economic trends for which we have only a few anecdotes and multi-purpose proclamations as evidence. After the battle *Romania* erupted into a series of catastrophic civil wars, with half a dozen generals proclaiming themselves emperor and dragging their forces away from the frontier and towards Constantinople, bands of Turkish raiders sacking most major cities, occupying fortresses, and setting up emirates, and Roman administrative centers either disappearing or localizing (as in Trebizond and the *Doukaton* of Antioch) as lines of taxation, communication, and armed authority were cut. If Manzikert had been won and Romanos continued being emperor there's no reason to think any of this would have happened.

"It's because your sample size is small, you can't make a real data set with only 2 points"
You can never be too paranoid about buying a used car. The only thing you can do his research it to the best of your ability and have someone look it over professionally for anything that could be an issue.  Sometimes decent vehicles often end up on small used car lots like the one you‚Äôre describing simply because the miles are too high or the year is too old for a bank to finance a vehicle to a conventional buyer. Nicer dealerships will often send vehicles away that can‚Äôt be financed.  Carfax is the best thing out there for the average consumer even though it‚Äôs not 100% flawless. Having a professional look it over is your best bet. Dealerships that are willing to let you take it to an independent mechanic and have nothing to hide.  Good luck!

"&gt; Like, if you don't want to do the side-missions, just don't do them.

Sure, but I actually did like the side-missions individually; the problem was that they made the overall story feel a bit disjointed. It's not even really about ""completionism"", since most of the areas have a pretty good ""primary"" mission that is theoretically relevant to the main story (usually the Red Templars/Venatori are scheming something and you need to stop them). It's just that the game doesn't do a very good job of actually tying them in - and like I said, the fact that you don't even need to visit most of the areas undercuts the importance of what you're doing there.

EDIT: I think it might have worked a bit better if instead of ""power"", you needed to do a side-area between each main quest - i.e. you foil Corypheus' plans in the main quest then you get an urgent note telling you that he's planning something dangerous in the next area so you need to deal with that before moving on. Would have improved the sense of urgency, and even made Corypheus seem like more of a threat since you're constantly putting out his fires (rather than just cruising around hunting bears and closing rifts until you clock up enough power to to the next main quest)."

"First i want to say i have no problem getting 5-0 1v1 games or 10-0 2v2 games with vader. With all the kills and non-deaths i get, the special ability life refill actually makes a massive difference. 

Without ranting away, two changes i could accept with vader: a near perfect blaster deflect, and perhaps a medium range auto force choke passive (disables when moved or moving and takes a short animation to enable). To balance this, i could justify removing his dash.

Vader is my favorite character in this game, and i'm very effective with him currently (90 percent or better win rate).I'd be happy to share my deck and strat in detail with video if you want. 

For Vader's special move, he actually does slash upon pulling and it does do aoe. You can insta-kill phoenix squad with it as an example. I actually don't use stun or pike for my vader deck. The pull is most effective with snipers (and by extension, vader is most effective with snipers); you can pull people into getting melted by triple snipers, and it can disorient/confuse players on how to respond. I actually enjoy his pull very much for these reasons; it's one of the most versatile specials.

I already mentioned how his special ability helps you when you play to stay alive, but i do agree that the passive health refill of other units than vader is fairly useless. I do like your suggestion, however, i'd modify it to: everytime vader is damaged, his units gain a brief damage reduction/armor bonus.

As for vaders normal attacks, i agree he should at least have a damage increase vs other heroes. He does plenty of damage against towers imo. I melt towers with 3x troops and jetpack troop combos while vader chops away. Takes 6 energy to melt a tower with vader, a fairly cheap cost.

I have him at lvl7, and i plan to keep him there. Worthy investment.

On Rey, i think her deflect should be nerfed to only deflect few bolts (honestly should be removed), additionally, her mind trick should only affect up to maybe 3 units and she should not be able to force heal (she doesn't even do that in canon, i believe) - to balance that, she could be given a 'scavenger bonus' where she gets extra health upon pickup, or extra enegy boost (if she picks up rook's drop), and maybe additional stamina.

"Hey there,

So if I understand correctly, you have two options.  The pharmacy that the receptionist incorrectly sent your script to can fax it to the correct pharmacy.  Now, the issue you may run into is that the pharmacy will say ""you just got this filled, we cannot refill it.""  At which point your doctor will need to speak to the pharmacy to explain the situation.  The other option is that your physician can cancel out the script and resend it out to the correct pharmacy.

You have a legitimate example of why you need medication from a certain manufacturer, so if your insurance starts playing stupid with you, your physician will have your two subsequent seizures as a reasonable explanation.  Best of luck!"

"There's a misconception that Hitler's Aryanism believed that white people were physically stronger than black people. That wasn't ever true at all. They defined superiority as based on intellect, not on physical strength.

So the fact that a black man can run fast, or play good basketball, or hammer more railroad spikes, didn't matter to them one whit, because those aren't considered particularly intellectual activities.

There's a lot of speculative confirmation bias about how Hitler refused to congratulate Jesse Owens, and the narrative says that was because Hitler refused to acknowledge a black person as superior to whites *at anything.* But Jesse Owens himself said [that's not the case](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jesse-owens-and-hitler-handshake/). And in fact there were [black soldiers in the Nazi army and even black kids in the Hitler Youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_black_people_in_Nazi_Germany). 

That being said, Nazis certainly did not think highly of blacks, and their opposition to miscegenation was a matter of weakening the cultural and intellectual power of whites, rather than a desire to eliminate black people.

(Just a few decades later, American Nazi Party chairman George Rockwell would attend a Louis Farrakhan rally, and advocating for Farrakhan's idea of a separate black country. Nazis considered blacks to be among the lowest forms of humans, but they mainly just wanted to exist without them rather than stomp them out.)

Now, if a black person had become world chess grandmaster... that would probably have really challenged their theories."

"&gt;30th in yards/attempt. 

By far the most telling.

This is why I keep saying we need to work more with the run game. In the modern NFL I'm OK with being pass heavy but there needs to be more of an intermediate/deep threat that gets opened up by forcing teams to dedicate more players to playing in the box.

If the run never opens up then it won't happen. We know Flacco can sling it. There is no reason why his YPA should be so low when he can zip the ball all over the field other than the fact that there isn't enough guys getting separation because teams aren't afraid of us putting the ball on the ground and moving the chains with it."
"Oh, I figured you were making watermelon seeds!  What I like about them is that they're small enough to masquerade as fake freckles while very clearly evoking watermelon seeds.

"If Horus didn't exist who put the Emperor on the Golden Throne? If you don't have a devil to threaten your followers with in the hereafter you'll never have actual faithful, just people paying lip service.

It varies some from world to world but the most widespread story says the Emperor was a man who created the 18 Primarchs. Horus fucked everything up, him and 8 of his brothers started a civil war. In the end the Emperor sacrificed himself to kill Horus and became a God, ascending to the Golden Throne, before his Faithful wiped out all the remaining traitors.

&gt;And how can a god emperor err? That's heresy.

The idea of an infallible God is actually a relatively recent idea. Greco-Roman Gods, Egyptian Gods, Norse Gods, etc. were all flawed creatures of immense power. Hell, half of Greek mythology comes from a human tricking a God to get what they want."

"&gt;Of the two first questions (storage and training) niether are defined in the bill

Both of these are somewhat defined in the initiative.

**Training**

&gt; (a) The purchaser provides proof that he or she has completed a 
recognized firearm safety training program within the last five 
years that, at a minimum, includes instruction on:  
&gt; (i) Basic firearms safety rules;
&gt; (ii) Firearms and children, including secure gun storage and 
talking to children about gun safety;
&gt; (iii) Firearms and suicide prevention;
&gt; (iv) Secure gun storage to prevent unauthorized access and use;
&gt; (v) Safe handling of firearms; and
&gt; (vi) State and federal firearms laws, including prohibited firearms transfers.
&gt; The training must be sponsored by a federal, state, county, or municipal law enforcement agency, a college or university, a nationally recognized organization that customarily offers firearms training, or a firearms training school with instructors certified 
by a nationally recognized organization that customarily offers 
firearms training. The proof of training shall be in the form of a certification that states under the penalty of perjury the training included the minimum requirements; 

**Secure Storage**

&gt; (24) ""Secure gun storage"" means:  
&gt; (a) A locked box, gun safe, or other secure locked storage space 
that is designed to prevent unauthorized use or discharge of a 
firearm; and 
&gt; (b) The act of keeping an unloaded firearm stored by such means.

Where exactly the line will be drawn remains to be seen, but looks like the training requires ""instruction"" only, and the secure storage would most certainly not include a ""Ziploc""."

"When you buy a gun, shoot it a few times, then sell it to a complete stranger in a parking lot and 6 mo later the gun is used in a shooting...then you played a role in that.  You introduced the gun into society and you resold it in an irresponsible way.  If all gun owners and all gun transfers needed to be tracked, then most of them would be and guns would be much harder and more expensive (same thing) for criminals to obtain.  As long as the gun lobby stands in the way of this common sense approach being enacted, it makes sense to push the liability onto the lobby's customers.  

Most gun owners are sensible people who support registration requirements.  But they don't really have a concentrated political voice the way the gun lobby does.  Enacting an expensive insurance requirement to re-internalize the costs of guns to society would give gun owners a stake in the policy fight and very quickly we'd see sensible reform at every level of govt.  Which would result in a great decrease in shootings.  Which would reduce the costs associated with guns, which would make everybody happy.  Except the NRA of course.  But they can go suck a donkey.

"&gt;How many of those people also own smart phones, flat screen TV's, WiFi, have big car payments? There are a lot of people (not all) who if that is their situation, it's due to their own choices.

Phones, internet, and cars are necessities in modern American life.  These are not luxuries; they are required in order to find and remain in contact with steady, gainful work.  Flat screen TV's are relatively inexpensive and do not constitute a major purchase.  Going without a $400 TV does not suddenly mean that your income goes up, or that the cost of living goes down.  Stop with this shit.

&gt;Maybe they should live somewhere different?

&gt;I mean, what are you actually suggesting here? The government step in and keep everyone in the lifestyle to which they are accustomed?

No, they should be paid appropriately for the area they work in.  When we allow a gas station to arbitrarily raise prices to obscene levels along a highway where there's no competition, it's called price-gouging.  When property owners do it, it's called the ""free market"".

&gt;Again, by and large, whose choices lead to that condition and what are you proposing should be done about it?

Corrupt tax structures, wage laws, anti-union laws, and crony capitalism leads to these conditions.  People are being underpaid for historically high productivity.  Those with capital are allowed to legally pillage the working class out of what they are left with.  Politicians are paid by these corrupt assholes to pass increasingly corrupt laws to further the pillaging.  The cycle continues.

"&gt;They were old enough to know that this is somewhat not okay

That's awfully naive. This was a grown ass woman who still didn't know killing animals isn't okay, so obviously age is irrelevant. But more importantly, I can't believe that you think the only reason people are angry about this is that they're afraid it will influence the kids to behave the same way. What about the fucking *trauma* of listening to your cat being strangled to death? If I had experienced this when I was 10 I would have been severely damaged. But you know what? The kids still aren't even the point. The bottom line is that killing your pet is animal abuse, and animal abuse is **wrong.** Now, it seems pretty clear that you disagree with that, making you among the *only* people in a first world country who thinks that murdering a pet is morally acceptable. I suppose that that's your opinion. But whether you like it or not, believing that animal murder is wrong is not a radical view. This kind of behavior is **against the law.** If you strangled your cat for peeing on the bed, it's a **felony.**  You could go to prison.  I dare you to tell a courtroom that animal abuse ""isn't really serious"" if said animal ""imo dun goofed."" So if you really think that pushing back on violence towards animals is reserved for ""peta freaks"" then you're either stupid or delusional or both."

"&gt; Ask your animal science professors if they believe every article just because it's highly cited. The truth is, even in science, you can find plenty of uncritical researchers who will believe things that suit their biases.

It shows that a thousands of people with PhDs getting published in peer reviewed journals found it credible enough to reference.  I'm not saying it's anything close to the end all be all, just that it's worth considering.  Chill out.

I read your article and it is very intriguing.  I know that human behavior can't be entirely explained through Savannah-derived genetics.  Certainly, the recent contexts we have grown in have impacted our evolution, culture and traits.  I would agree that a long-term evolutionary approach should be supplemented by looking at recent evolutionary drivers, cultural drivers and exploring actual mechanisms that may be causing something.  I never disagreed with any of this.  Still, there's enough data with large enough sample size to convince me that there are some inherit differences in the personalities of men and women.  Especially when you consider the fact that these changes become more pronounced in the most gender-equal societies.  And it's in those gender-equal countries that we generally see the most differences in the careers picked by men and women. Again, I've never said that culture isn't playing a role.  But, do you really not believe that biological differences between men and women **plays into** differences in careers picked on average?  Do you really think that the very low rate of women in STEM, and high rate of women in people-oriented fields in egalitarian Scandinavia has **nothing** to do with biological differences between the genders?  I think you know that's ridiculous.

"\&gt; End of the day you can still table arguments, have them be entirely valid, yet not sound.

The thing I think you are failing to realize, is that this is not just a problem in philosophy. This is a problem in other areas as well.

Math for example, is just the exploration of the implications of different sets of axioms. Different axioms, different maths.

Any sort of discipline has lots of foundational assumptions that provide the structure for people to develop their knowledge inside the discipline.

Philosophy is not fundamentally unlike any other discipline in this way, except for the fact that it is directly engaged with that specific problem, which is common to all disciplines.

The disciplines that you are celebrating also tend to have philosophies themselves. Mathematicians tend to have platonic ideas about forms that exist in some abstract but still real space, because in their work they have lots of experience with those sorts of abstractions. I also remember coming across some work that had been done by chemists on the ""philosophy of chemistry"".

I never quite figured out what was going on with that one, but I imagine the story is similar. The methods of that discipline probably leads them to be more comfortable with a particular set of philosophical inclinations.

Say I just take you at face value, and rejected philosophy entirely, and took other disciplines to be more useful in understanding reality. From there I would expect them all to share the same ""useful"" no-philosophy philosophy.

However, I think what you will find is that different disciplines that are engaged with the study of reality tend to have different underlying assumptions and therefore different philosophies.

Why? It's just the way the cookie crumbles. There isn't really any ultimate foundation for knowledge. Different assumptions made in lieu of that err in different ways, so different philosophies are going to makes things simpler for different disciplines.

That means you can't really remove it and expect things to just work nicely. Chemists will argue with mathematicians, who will argue with physicists, etc., and nobody will be there to referee.

"I'm pretty sick of seeing so called articles by dipshit writers paid to write a perceptional piece so those unfamiliar with the facts at hand just blindly assume he actually cares about the subject, made a real effort to understand nootropics and get the best results for himself. 

When you talk to most doctors they are not going to of course recommend nootropics. Why would they? They are taught in college to prescribe only for medical conditions not to look at research and decide what may be best for someone experiencing subclinical issues or those with conditions like mtbi which there is NO approved drug for use. Having a degree does not make you an expert in nootropics. The degree you research, understand, and use them does.

It's no different with many supplement hit pieces. People don't stand up for supplements in because they are not drugs even though many are in other countries and many are well researched. Easily target for bs writers to make people look like idiots for taking them. Just look at the history of cars and those who jay walked.

Yes many people are sheep and do what's popular and avoid doing things socially less acceptable but it doesn't change the facts. Mushrooms and MDMA are FDA breakthrough therapies now and will be approved for conditions because they are so much more effective than conventional medicine but public opinion is low because of propaganda and those who had a bad time. It's frightening how not bad science and media has refrained these therapies from being accessible. How many people died or never got help because they could not get access to an alternative treatment? Too many."

"I was I similar position with my ex husband. After almost 11 yrs together he had gained a beer belly. I stuck through it all... his going out with friends and coming back til the next morning, drinking til he passed out, his hygiene took a massive dip too. When you love someone so much you don‚Äôt want to let them know how your really feel or what you really think, but it‚Äôs a double sided sword because not speaking about it will bring consequences. Eventually the point of no return is reached and there is absolutely nothing anyone can do to fix it, sometimes the love slowly dies because well we all do fall in love with the person they used to be. Communication is key, if there is no communication and understanding then there is nothing. Never take anything for granted, just because we have someone today doesn‚Äôt mean that it will be forever."

"I would also file a complaint with the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) I had an issue where a school was trying to collect on a loan I was paying through the government.

"I have no idea why they nerfed DD if they turned DS in what they are right now. I understand that DD were a really good option to choose from, but having little to no cleave, almost no push strength meant you couldn't just facetank stuff and spam attack. It actually required some level of skill (still does) to handle them without taking too much damage and the headshot bonus on heavy attacks was a nice bonus for good aim.

As it currently stands, DS outperforms DD in every way. Better at horde clear, better at elite killing. No idea what they were thinking @Fatshark.

Also heard that the spear is pretty darn good too as the light stabs pen. armour and can (as I've been told) kill elites very quickly.

If spamming heavy attacks with DD was the problem, they should have reduced the heavy attack damage and increase the headshot bonus accordingly. The 1-hit SV breakpoint is unreachable now and so is the 3-hit mauler. Increases killing times by quite a lot for what the weapon is advertised to be good against."

It's not like we haven't had domestic political terrorists use bombs and/or the mail system in this country before.

"Rock is such a broad genre, but I thought I would try to call up some recent bands that fit your criteria, ""worth the instruments they're playing."" These artists released their first album within the last ten years.

* Tame Impala
* Ty Segall (a prolific songwriter.)
* Foxygen (experimental but firmly rooted in classic rock.)
* King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard (again, prolific artists making headlines for releasing five albums in one year)
* Hiss Golden Messenger (more on the folk end, but definitely rock)
* Big Thief (quiet, very indie, but the guitars make this a definite rock band)
* Mac Demarco (was Steely Dan rock? Mac and the guys cover Steely Dan likes it's no one's business but your dad's.)
* Benjamin Booker (awesome, noisy guitar rock. Bluesy and groovy.)
* Kevin Morby (listen to ""City Music."" He's got guitar chops as well.)
* Alabama Shakes (has found wide acclaim.)

There are so many better acts to listen to. Explore, find a band you like. Check out other acts on their label. The rock 'n' roll well is deep. Drink up!

"Thanks again for posting these! Vespa's art team is doing great work as usual. King's Raid may have some issues, but this 10/10 art is content worth paying for.

From the top we have our new girl Seria! And it's the long awaited Yamato Nadeshiko character. Truly a classical beauty with that long dark hair and a sharp princess cut. Her outfit is the ever popular skirt and thighhighs combo with high heeled boots. That zettai ryouki never fail to grab my attention. Her pose emphasizes her delicious thighs too. Color wise the black and gold does fit her demon hunter persona. I like the contrast provided by her white skirt. I'm surprised Vespa hasn't released character like this earlier. I'm a bit tempted to bribe her with rubies outright, but I'm not a huge fan of the generic serious demon hunter character with the fallen family member. My favorite waifus have that extra something that really slays me.

Now for the outfits, oh boy what a haul. First up is 9 Tails Viska. Now THIS is undisputed the best outfit of this batch. It's prefect! 10/10 on the theme and visual design. I believe in Japanese Folk Lore Fox demons have a tendency to posses people or take on human form, which perfectly fits Viska and her persona. Now if her 3D model uses tails instead of her usual tentacles that would be the cheery on top. I love the colors used too. Blue eyes + Silver hair banzai! Great outfit all around.

Halloween Scarlet enters the fray with an eye catching bunny girl costume. Hm while bunny girls are always great, something looks a little off? Is it the expression? Seems a bit soft for Scarlet the embodiment of JUSTICE. We've had a bunch of other bunny girl costumes too so no points for originality/uniqueness. A salient effort but a pass for me.

Oh boy Ophelia, she's just too amazing. Her slightly lewd and seductive expression, those little hearts, that sly smile with those mischievous eyes. My heart has been thoroughly criticaled. Ophelia usually gives off the impression of a gentle and sweet girl, so seeing her like this shows a gap moe that really hits the spot. Somehow it's appropriate too since Ophelia is all about finding her Fated love. She's on the attack now! Funnily enough all that was really just about Ophelia herself. Once I stopped swooning and looked at the actual outfit well hm. Honestly it looks like a mishmash of her Mate of Fate wedding dress and Artemia's Halloween costume with some wings added. The dark color scheme is rather one note and boring. The thigh high stockings plus high heels are attractive, but her wedding dress also had amazing stockings with better shoes. I guess she's showing more cleavage in this outfit, but the style is overall the same as what she wore before. Plus she's once again missing her HAT! She has the best witch's hat in the game. I'd even call it one of her charm points. Her wedding dress also didn't have the hat but the rest of the outfit made up for it. Ah well, this ALMOST made me forgo the purchase, but that expression was too seductive. Combine that with Ophelia being my second favorite waifu in the whole game and my rubies are gone. 

Ravioli ravioli don't lewd the dragon loli! Lilia outfit is.. dangerously designed to say the least. Your mileage may vary on this one haha. I note that it's cut to emphasize certain parts. I do like the way they colored Lilia's hair though, the blues do a good job at showing her water dragon lineage. Still for me, even if I had Lilia I'd pass on this one. It's the gigantic cat paws and feet that kill it for me. I just can't stand them at all.

"Just an FYI, IBS may not be considered a qualifying condition in your state. For instance, only Crohn's and Inflammatory Bowel Disease would be qualifying conditions in mine. If you're worried about asking your doctor, it might be good to check the viability of it beforehand to give you some peace of mind. 

If it is a qualifying condition, your state may likely have a physician list available online that you could refer to to find a 420-friendly doc to give you your recommendation letter. My state has that resource, and I imagine that has helped narrow the search for a lot of folks.

I qualified for MMJ due to PTSD, and it has helped with symptoms like anxiety, depression and pain management to some extent but I haven't found it too helpful in reducing specific GI symptoms related to IBS-D. Everyone's different, and also being knowledgeable of the properties that make up cannabis can really make the difference in finding what works best for your body chemistry."

"I was writing a long post about my LTR (14 years) with a depressed woman but lost the post because I'm on the mobile. I guess I don't wanna let pass a few things, so:

1. **Depression can be a chronic pathology**. For the sake of both she should ask her doctor what he thinks about this. It is hard to listen the words ""you will never recover from this"" coming out from a doctor, that I know, but it is fair for you to know this and decide on your future.

2. **Antidepressants do lower our libidos and promote weight gain**. I like chubby women as well as thin, so I didn't care much about her getting bigger. I really like her curves. But yeah, this thing is important for certain cultures.

3. **Fortunately, not all antidepressants lower the libido for everyone**. This is crucial, if one thing does not work there are alternatives and combinations that she can try always under psychiatric supervision. Don't settle on a medication that hurts your bedroom, that's a shared concern. Equally, don't ever try to stop or modify a medication without the psychiatrist recommendation.

4. **In my opinion, the most important thing for a relationship with a depressed person is his/her independence**. I'm not saying you don't take care of her needs occasionally, I'm saying help her figure out her life and act as you would with any person you love. You must understand depression is not a continuous state in her mind, it is something that comes and goes (if it is chronic this will happen all the time). My point is she must deal with her depression because she wants to be out of that state most of the time. If you are convinced or you suspect she is using her condition to get all of your attention while you would prefer to be doing something else, that is a problem. In my case, I am absolutely convinced my SO would be better than me if we were getting a divorce. If you are not convinced you can say that, you have to talk to her and set limits.

It is also important to talk as much as possible and you, OP, bear in mind her depressed being is not the one she is unless she wants to. When depressed, people can say a lot of shit that don't really mean. If you are thinking about leaving, talk to her and share your piece as you would do with anybody else."

They say that because the common two causes are alcohol and gallstones blocking the pancreatic duct

As for my case , they did MRIs of my chest and all that, and my gallbladder/gallstones were perfectly normal so they ruled that out

And then they don't think it's alcohol related because i started feeling the symptoms on a saturday, and that entire week I hadn't really drank much alcohol. Plus, they said it's caused from alcohol after binge drinking sessions, and around that time i was only drinking like 1-3 times a week, and my limit per night was usually like 3 drinks max, cause i usually prefer to smoke over drinking. So they were comfortable saying that it wasn't alcohol related, but they said it might have still been a slight possibility, since who knows what can happen."

If he leaves you guessing, that‚Äôs added stress and a turn off that you don‚Äôt need when you‚Äôre trying to make it fun for both of you. 

Also...I know this one from experience. 

My guy used to try to push himself to make it happen. Like you, I wasn‚Äôt always convinced. Like you it was weird and made me hesitate. Honestly if you think about it, it‚Äôs fucking annoying. If you‚Äôre sore I‚Äôll stop already, this isn‚Äôt rocket science. 

So me being me, I complained about it. I told him it turns me off if I even suspect I‚Äôm hurting him. He is better than he used to be. He‚Äôs a lot more vocal about telling me ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it...feels good...‚Äù And most of all he‚Äôs better and faster at asking me to slow down, pause, switch things up to try something else for a while, or call it a day. 

The fact that he‚Äôs better at telling me to stop means i actually believe him now when he tells me to keep going. 

This is the biggest secret to good fucking. When someone asks ‚ÄúHow should I tell my guy if it starts to hurt?‚Äù the answer is ‚ÄúOw! Woah, woah! Stop!‚Äù Be blunt about it. Because if you are honest and get to the point he will trust you. (Plus he‚Äôll stop battering-ram-ing your hole.) And then after that all those other times when everything is perfect and you‚Äôre saying ‚ÄúNow! MORE!! Harder!!‚Äù he will trust you then too.

"&gt;A lack of evidence isn't evidence for the opposing view, sure.. but the burden of proof lies with those that make claims of god/ the afterlife, not those they are trying to convince.

If someone who believes in god is trying to convince others, this is entirely correct.

On the other hand, if someone who doesn't believe in god is trying to convince others, the opposite is true.

It goes both ways. One side claims god exists, one side claims god doesn't exist. Both sides have no proof.

The burden of proof doesn't sit on one side or the other, unless there's an actual meaningful outcome, like proving/disproving disability for a benefit payment, or proving where you were on the night of a murder. Outside of that, if two people disagree, the burden of proof is with the person challenging someone else's claim."

"Sure, but OP is making it seem like Fury is the best team by a mile and nothing competes. The only thing that could legitimately be considered broken is Security. Your tank shouldn't be dropping 40 bombs on people. Every other minion relies on the team to make them better than they are which is the point of synergy teams. If all synergy teams were equal (not saying they shouldn't be) then they should be equally as easy/hard to obtain as well. Fury is far and beyond more difficult to obtain than any other character in the game so naturally his team has the edge.

If this were SWGOH a team of Fury, SL, IM, Thanos, and DP would be the meta disregarding all synergy. For all FN gets wrong, they've managed power creep very well. No new character is insanely OP on their own and a team of only event characters can't break the game. We've got nothing like Luke coming out and soloing raid content. New characters are just good enough to entice people to spend on them, which is the sweetspot. As far as your rock, paper, scissors go we might get that with brotherhood."

is that a joke or just a statement about the game in general. (I hate watching professional sports so I honestly don't know)
"The church obviously didn't want any nudity so M went ahead and painted some people naked anyways. So whenever you seen someone in the Sistine Chapel thats wear a red robe or dress, those were the ones that were originally nude and the church had to later paint it over to cover them up

When he painted Julius he but a cherub behind him who was flicking him off

the back wall has a lot of subtle fuck yous in it When you look at Jesus, he's looking a bit plump and more well fed then other painted Jesus. This really pissed off the Pope because it made it look like Big J was sinful and gluttonous

Edit: accidently clicked sent the post. So on the back wall you have heaven at the top- which is where all the past Popes are and Jesus are. Then in the middle is his depiction of purgatory and then bottom is hell and the people in it. So for Heaven, there was a Pope St. Bartholomew that had been skinned alive and killed. So M painted a Pope holding the big flap of skin that was from the St. Bartholomew body. [https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/artwork/michelangelos-last-judgment2.htm](https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/artwork/michelangelos-last-judgment2.htm)

And in hell he drew himself among the crowd of damned souls and it's of him pointing up to the Popes and laughing at them

Pope Julius II wanted the vatican church to be bigger than the pantheon which was the place of worship for pagans and M as well. So he made M design and lead the construction. It was only after M died they found he purposefully made the Vatican church small when they measured it by like 50-100 feet

I'll add some more if I think of them. Hope you found it entertaining

Edit- its been a running joke for the past 500 years that the statue of David's penis is quite noticeably small.

Researchers say David isn't just simply striking a pose; David is facing his opponent the giant Goliath. Researchers made a computerized scan of the sculpture as part of their study, and found that every minute, anatomical detail shows a guy scared out of his mind. Their diagnosis: His dingle isn't just hilariously tiny, it's running for cover. Which physiologically speaking, is normal penis behavior when the owner of said penis is on the verge of fighting a giant.

EDIT EDIT-- another easter egg

The Papal official who objected to all the nudity was a certain Monsignor Biaggio Da Casena. Michelangelo got his revenge by painting him as one of the demons in hell. (He's the one with the ears of a donkey in the lower left hand corner of painting.)"

"you should re read it. We get some of the best characters in this arc and their backgrounds explained. Law, Corazon, Doffy, Sabo etc



luffy competes in a Coliseum under the alias Lucy because the prize is the mera mera no mi. Sabo(luffys 2nd ""brother"") takes luffys place in the Coliseum and wins aces fruit, eats it, then proceed to have a brief skirmish with fujitora after 1 shotting jesus Burgess and a Vice Admiral

the toys in the town are people who have been transformed due to one of duffy's family members fruits. The SHats basically knock her out and everyone transforms back

luffy and law fight doffy and law gets stomped but uses his special technique gamma knife to trash duffy's organs. Unfortunately doffy uses his own fruit to hold his insides in place. Luffy goes gear 4 th and fights with doffy and tires quickly so the town helps stall doffy for a bit so luffy can recover his stamina. 

Meanwhile doffy has a cage of strings around the whole island that is getting closer and closer to crushing everyone inside called the ""birdcage"". Luffy recovers his stamina and 1 shots doffy saving everyone. Fujitora allows the straw hats to escape and gets basically banned from returning to marina HQ from Akainu because of it.

We learn Doffy is a celestial dragon himself and has been making SMILE (artifical zoan devil fruits) with the help of Caesar Clown for Kaido.

At the end Luffy forms the Straw Hat Alliance. Basically from all the people who he competed with in the Coliseum that will aid him later on the future when called upon.

You‚Äôre one lucky guy
"Response! Yay! :)

Well, the next question is: Are you looking for something to excel in Single Player (I.e is strong as much as possible along its‚Äô levelling curve)? Or something that excels at purely Level 40? Which thing you prioritise (levelling curve vs level 40 strength) is important to consider.

Sorcerers generally take a while to come online, no matter which way they are built. I actually advocate for Wizards over Sorcerers in the OC and Expansions for this reason: most of your difficulty is encountered at lower levels, and Wizards are stronger than Sorcerers at lower levels thanks to their extra selection of spells.

Another thing to consider is that Melee is a LOT more powerful than spellcasting in the early levels, particularly when it comes to Damage. Ironically, the AC buffs, weapon buffs and Damage Reduction spells that Wizards/Sorcerers receive at early levels [Mage Armour, Shield, Protection from Evil, Ghostly Visage, Magic Weapon, Flame Weapon are all level 1 or 2 spells] makes them quite suited to be played as melee characters early on. A notable exception to this are DC-based Crowd Control spells like Sleep and Hold Person (which are very powerful early on), but again, these don‚Äôt do damage, and can be followed up with Melee.

https://www.reddit.com/r/neverwinternights/comments/9ko7jn/original_campaign_oc_character_build_melee_mage/

https://www.reddit.com/r/neverwinternights/comments/9ko9tc/expansion_campaigns_sou_hotu_character_build/

As mentioned in another post above, I‚Äôd go for something like these ( ie Wizard rather than Sorcerer) for the Original Campaigns. Once you hit the teen levels however, Sorcerers begin to outshine Wizards in terms of firepower. Lots of flat Damage spells begin to come online (Damage Shields, IGMS, Evards being the main ones) and Sorcerers simply have more of these to spam at people than Wizards do.

At level 40, something like a Sorc 36 Pal 3 Monk 1 has lots of offensive and defensive options at their disposal, and would definitely outshine the Wiz builds that I linked to previously. But! They‚Äôre harder to play early on, and most difficult parts of the campaign are played early on.

Something to consider anyway. If you‚Äôre very much after a Sorcerer, something like the Sorc 29 Pal 1 Build is a good baseline. I would not go for the 20/20 Pal/Sorcerer build; it takes way too long for spells to come online. 

If you 'do' want to use melee for damage purposes, then taking 1-2 Paladin levels before level 20 for proficiencies and/or extra attack is sufficient to be a threatening melee character for the OC and HoTU [and maybe not even be necessary for SoU]. This is the tactic of the aforementioned Wizard builds that i used for the campaigns.

Prioritising Melee early with the above points in mind is IMO a good way to go [maybe 14str 10dex 14con 14int 8wis 16cha as stats?], with the aforementioned Paladin level early for Weapon and Armour proficiencies. This of course would delay the attainment of Sorcerer spells, but it would make early levels easier to play.

Edit: I suppose one more question that could shed some light: Do you plan on using Henchmen? Or do you plan to do everything solo to maximise the XP you receive?"

"Great to get someone in touch with the topic here. Sorry for late reply, but I just hadn't had enough time to write a full, thought reply.   


1. I disagree with your point here. Visual art is not limited in any way by language barriers, until it's based on language and written or spoken text. Imagine a story like this:  
There is finnish writer and finnish painter. The first one writes great poem about Finland's culture and mythology, full of smart double-meaning phrases. The second one creates a picutre of the same topic, with great mythological figures.   
Problem number 1: Who do you think will have an easier job giving his work to all of the people around the globe? Problem number 2: Who do you think will be more understood by the audience? Problem number 3: Which type of art will be more praised, the one which a few can understand, or the one many can enjoy and praise? Let me just answer to these as well.  
1: Of course, the painter. There are tons of english-based sites for artists such as painters to post their work. And tons of people use these sites, as art posted there is not limited by language barrier. 2: Of course, painter again. Pictures are way less complicated to understand than written text. You can enjoy the visual value without even understanding what it is. You can't enjoy a poem you will be unable to read, it'll be just a mumble for you. 3: OF course, visual art. As proved before.  

2. By the ""time to understand"", I mean you need to read it first, read it again, if you don't know the language - translate it (which already ruins the poem), then think again... In the case of sculptures, paintings etc., you just need a few quick glances at the statue, picture, whatever. You can read about it and it's meaning in your language, no matter who created it, and understand it better and easier, as translations of the explanations are not ruining the art in this case.  

3. Lucky you, but in my - pretty big - city, the only ""poetry readings"" are in some archives, as small events, that took place few years back. Now it's either non-existant or very poorly announced and attended. Your link is true only to USA, as far as I understand, and as a non-american person, that does not really work in my case. In here, poets are marginalised and not taken care of, until they've already achieved something big, mostly by dying in a war or being in ties with politics. And I haven't heard about any of the names given by you, sorry.  

4. Poetry lasts ages, but it does not change the world for ages. Young people nowadays just either laugh at the old poetry or openly yawn when learning about it. Nobody's even trying with current poetry. I've never seen a poem destroying ideas, painting pictures - I am open for examples here. But sad truth is, if I ever see a poem making someone think, it's when they think what a crazy guy wrote it, how boring it is, and how much time was wasted on it, then heading to watch some - in my opinion - art more worth of noticing.  


Poetry sure isn't for everyone. I write poems myself, good or bad - not up to me to decide. But then, noone really cares. Noone seems to be into poems anymore. It's overall boring to the great majority of people, which brings the question of it's importance in our world. And I believe that poetry is far behind all of other art, thus making it absolutely unimportant for anyone else than passionates. And we don't have a lot of them anymore. Poetry just became a niche hobby for outcasts."

"In countries where cannabis is illegal, ALL of the money goes to the ""drug lords"".

In legalized markets, profits are lower, higher quality and variety is expected, licensing and inspections happen. People have way better options than the drug lords.

A key factor that isn't commonly explained, is that in a black market, neither buyer nor seller think there is an issue with the crime. If the police turn a blind eye or take a bribe, it's not in anybody's interests to report it, so the gates to corruption are wide open. That may be why the police are against it.

In a legal market, the police are expected to do their real job of keeping everything safe, and people complain when they don't."

"There is a difference between the coercion and the voluntary. It's immoral irrespective of the circumstances to enslave 49% of the population in service of the other 51%. The government is that great fiction whereby 51% of the population attempts to live off the other 49% and the manufactured consent resulting is justified and moral because it was the will of the majority. The things your talking about food, healthcare can be had through moral and harmless ways if you cannot pay for it yourself then through charity. But through force it can only be had at the barrel of a gun and the trampling of freedom and liberty. There are differences between positive and negative rights only one of which is moral."

"Mine is a Whirlpool and the Sani-Rinse adds 43 minutes to the cycle. 

Why would a dishwasher not have the sanitize cycle as the final part? That makes no sense.

From Whirlpool:

&gt; If the Sanitize option is selected, the dishwasher will heat the final rinse water from 145¬∞F (62.7¬∞C) to 155¬∞F (68.3¬∞C) and hold the temperature there for 10 minutes to successfully sanitize the dishes."
"If you want to do a proper analysis of expected vs. actual output, you should be looking at what you'd reasonably expect out of a player at the time of the call up (a projection from Steamer or ZiPS is a great starting point).  Obviously the vast majority of minor leaguers are not equal in talent to a Trout or a Bregman so yes, you'd expect a large amount of them to struggle their first few weeks in the bigs.  And no, it wouldn't be surprising that 99/100 of them fail to reach all star production and that 1/20 become replacement level.  I'd be much more interested in knowing what the results are for similar prospects to Tucker instead (i.e. 60 FV plus hit/power prospects)  

Tucker does pretty much everything you'd want an elite position player prospect to do:  he flashes a polished, well rounded toolset that scouts love while consistently being several years young for his levels and still hitting at a great rate everywhere he goes.  If you dig into the peripherals there's even more to get excited about because of things like his low GB rate and continually improving plate discipline.  The only thing that could possibly concern me about a prospect in a 72 PA sample is an abnormally high SwStr% (e.g. Lewis Brinson ran a 17.4% in 55 PA in 2017), and Tucker was about average in that regard in his espresso debut (10.8%).

"Booker's proposal isn't actually all that well-designed. 

Because the benefit might be greater than a raise, or the parents estimate of future worth of the invested benefit anyway, it creates an incentive not to earn more income in some situations. Because the money is asset-limited the prices of a few types of goods/services will be bid up, namely housing and tuition, and a portion of subsidy will accrue to whoever benefits from that. Given the income profile of universities and homeowners you can see that this isn't just a subsidy for the poor. Furthermore, it's highly debateable whether we should even want to subsidize homeownership in this country.

Generally this proposal is well-intentioned but not so well executed. Which seems oddly reminiscent of conservatove criticisms of other welfare programs."
I believe he grew up in Brooklyn
"History teacher. His name was Carmel, students called him Caramel. He had schizophrenia which got worse as the years went by but couldn't retire due to stupid laws. 

He was a lovely person but 100% unfit for teaching, emotional and paranoid with a really short fuse and the rumors always spread that he was crazy so kids were mean and made a point to trigger him whenever possible.

Once I saw him notice a hole in his desk, he looked up to the class to check if he was being watched and everybody was writing something down as per his order, not me, I knew he wouldn't check anyway so I was just watching him without him knowing. He proceeded to open his water bottle which was always resting on top of his 9 month pregnant belly, looks up one more time to make sure no one's looking and goes for the kill.

I tilt my head down to not get caught and then back up to see Professor Carmel pouring a tiny bit of water into this hole in his desk. He smiles like a little kid, gets immersed (pun intended) and pours more and more water into the hole until it fills up and overflows him with joy.

This teacher was a gem, when he was in good spirits you could find him at the cafe next to our school reading encyclopedias, he also wrote poetry and was an overall very gentle and misunderstood human.

Ultimately he ended up committing suicide on Valentines Day. Having never found any form of love from a woman, he wrote love poems everyday and deposited them in the school library. His last day he did that just like any other day, people who saw him that day say he was cheerful and mid afternoon he threw himself from the 4th floor dying instantly.

He's the most memorable one, he was always kind and often mistreated by his students because stupid youth likes to be mean. He could explode and shout that he was ashamed to be a human if triggered but could also be a lovely gentle person if treated right. 

One thing I'll never forget was how once I heard him say that the one single thing he loved the most in the whole world, were his students. Breaks my heart."

"Two of his sisters played ball at MIZ. His aunt is the head coach here. To say he had a connection here is putting it mildly. An 18 year old kid needed to make a major decision in a much shorter time-frame than originally expected because of the Washington situation. His dad was hired as assistant coach of the men's team, and he sat right next to Cuonzo for every single game. Putting so much emphasis on him loving Cuonzo so much and that being the reason he chose mizzou just isn't right. Cuonzo is also incredible, turning our program around again. 

And I did not say I doubted his integrity. He seems like a wonderful guy. But ask many mizzou fans and they'd tell you he was a distraction down the stretch. He teased he was coming back months before he did, and kept bringing it up and instead of talking about our team doing great things the focus was on him. It's entirely possible this wasn't his fault (at the very end of the season it was his dad keeping him out), but that doesn't erase the perception a lot of the fan base felt. 

Also, he doesn't need to be Johnny Manziel to want a big city lol. That's where this whole thing started. I just could easily see him wanting a spotlight - it'd be completely consistent my perception of him this far. He can be an amazing person and still want a bigger city (Lebron?). I hope he stays and loves it here, winning tends to have that effect on people.

"Progessors can be very different in and out of class. What they say to 100+ students to get their point across in a limited time, and what they will say to an upset student in her office can be very different. It doesn't mean they are lying, or they contradict themselves. They are just giving you information the rest of the class didn't know about.

Lots of professors do this, even without a crying student in their lap. That's why office hours are so important, because the professor can adapt and even give you downright answers to what you need. Which they won't do to an entire class. "

"I do recall them saying Legends was based on Dokkan feedback, so heres a few ideas from dokkan they can use

1: Discounts. For a limited time period, every, EVERY 4th multi is free

2: Step ups. Dokkans step ups (GLB Exclusive) work as follows

&gt;Do a multi at reduced Price (IIRC first 4 multis are 25-35-40-0 Stones. Everything past that is 50-50-50-0 within the time period of 250 hours

&gt;Every Multi except the free one gave tickets for the 250mil celebration (Overall similar to the Master Banner legends has)

3: This wasnt added until after 3 years (Almost 3 years on GLB), but nowadays EVERY Multi guarentees 1 SSR or higher.

SSR being the Dokkan equivelant of Sparking

Any one of these would work fine for Legends, but right now,multis are just for convenience purposes."

"Feeling squishy in Red Maps is pretty normal unless you've specifically built to be tanky. Without knowing more (PoB or just a link to your profile (assuming you've made it public) and the name of the character), it's hard to say more.

4k armor and 2.5k evasion are both pretty small values, so they're not doing a lot (definitely not nothing... but also not a lot).

If you're ranged and offscreening things, those defenses should be sufficient to do almost everything (Shaper/\~300 Delves), but you'll definitely need to be actively dodging, not facetanking, and mechanical skill will be necessary for things like Guardians/Shaper.

If you're melee, get Fortify now, it makes a huge difference. A source of blind (Stibnite flask instead of Granite, Abyss Jewels) also can cut damage dramatically.

And yeah... more HP helps a surprisingly large amount. The difference between 6k and 7k doesn't seem huge numerically, but in terms of play it feels much safer."

It's like needing to tidy your room: it's not exactly a great mystery how to do it, rather the problem is actually doing it.

"In Australia is was 1996, 35 people were shot in what's known as the Port Arthur Massacre. From that point the government said 'you know what, farmers don't need semiautomatic weapons or high capacity magazines, neither do people who shoot as a sport, and nobody else needs guns'. It's a little more nuanced than that, but most people (even shooting enthusiasts) went along with the gun buy back (government paid 'market price' for any weapons that were no longer legal, then destroyed them). To own a firearm in Australia you need to have a valid reason (not actually that hard, just live on a farm or have a friend who owns some property to write you a letter of permission to shoot on their land), fill out a few forms and get  a license. Firearms are taxed highly so they're expensive, and you have to register your guns and keep them locked in an approved safe that is bolted to the wall/floor. "

Picking the lightest, least amount of plastic used in ANY plastic item, like a straw is knee jerk stupidity.    Remember when we used to have boxes of laundry soap?  And now everything has to have water added to the soap to make it liquid?  Even PODs come in a plastic bucket.    So much more energy efficient shipping all that water based product around now, in plastic containers isn't it?     "

But if Turkey wants something from our fridge, we have options.  ""well what do you got?"" or ""no I'm not trading that intel"".

Because almost certainly, Haspel is acting in some capacity as head of the CIA in some other not-so-publicized way while she's there.

"&gt; If you're OK with a small percentage back on a card

This is totally passive, you don't need to do anything to receive cash back.

&gt;but not ok with a small percentage in an account AND a small percentage back on a card

First, you're trading 3-5% of guaranteed cash back for 1-2% cash back + ~4% from active short term investments, which is moderately risky. 

If you spend a lot on your credit cards (i.e. make a lot money) the potential extra ~2% has too little value to be worth your time. If you don't, then the risk definitely not worth the meager returns.

&gt;You also have the option of scheduling future payments (as long as you don't have 0 balance) it's not difficult to do. Maybe 5 minutes including log in time.

I stand corrected and I do see how this can be done, but you still have to make sure you remember to pull that pay off money out of the markets before that final payment hits or its late fees + interest + over draft...all for $100 over 18 months?"

They are there so idiots like you feel safer at the expense of being able to defend society against a real elite threat. Imagining it could never happen here is stupid considering it happens all around today's world. Being armed is literally the only thing that enforces fear in the elite. They're racheting up their pressure to disarm because the wealth and income disparity is growing astronomical. They know their heads are soon on pikes so they hope to head that off with domestic spying and disarming the population.

That's exactly why I would say that the education system *should* be involved, though. I remember being taught basic internet safety in school--simple things, like don't give your name or address to strangers online, don't give anyone your photos, don't click pop-ups, etc. It wasn't a class; I think we just dedicated a day of library hour to it or something, and teachers would remind us of key points whenever we used the computer.

"&gt; So if my current landlord serves me a 5 day notice to pay or quit on the 2nd, and I inform them that I am breaking the lease, can they or will they still evict me?

Yes on the ""can,"" though nobody (other than them) knows if they *will.*

In this case, since you're still in arrears on payment (presumably, otherwise you wouldn't be getting the notice), they can take you to court not only for eviction (which will compel you to leave), but for non-payment as well (meaning you will owe them for your last month regardless). It is in your best interest to negotiate a termination in exchange for a nominal sum.

On top of which, this part:

&gt; they can't refuse an ESA letter

Isn't at all true. Not sure where people get their info from, but lots of mom-and-pop landlords do not have to let ESA's in due to the FHA limits on number of units owned, and an eviction against you will show up in any major complex's standard tenant check if they perform one."

If he stuck around in Vento Aureo, he could probably emulate Sticky Fingers punches, which could also be powerful.

Act 3 is already pretty useful too. It also has an A in development potential (a B by the start of Vento Aureo), which means it's got abilites yet to be discovered which can only make it more versatile."

"*At best*, the odds against you succeeding are on the wrong side of 100:1.

* You still need to learn all the material. Nobody will explain any of it to you unless you are very lucky and find an extremely patient mentor. There are no office hours or lectures.
* Again, you still need to learn all the material. How do you know if you understand it or not? Who will check your work? You can't just start working as an engineer and hope you get it right.
* Learning all the material takes 4-5 years on average while doing it full time. Part time you can double that, *if* you are able to keep yourself on track without external motivation. The vast majority of people can't. Figure 15-20 years as more realistic, at which point you're a brand new engineer with 1-2 decades of experience as a tech or mechanic. That assumes you really can teach yourself.
* Unless you're using the knowledge for your own business, you need someone willing to take a huge risk with hiring a non-degreed 'engineer'. Those 100:1 odds are optimistic on this step alone.
* You learn a ton during senior projects, coops and internships. Except you won't, because you're not doing any of those. You can learn different skills, but they won't always be related to starting a career as an engineer.
* You will face a huge challenge after you start your career as an engineer, until you're a licensed practicing engineer. A degree is a competence floor. You must have a minimum level of skill and intelligence to get one. Without a degree, you can't easily prove you're above that minimum level. Trust can be hard to come by.

I have worked with many, many people in blue collar jobs who claimed they could or planned to learn everything they might need to transition into mechanical engineering or a similar STEM job on their own, with no formal training or education. Somewhere well into three figures.

Of that group, I'm aware of precisely two who pulled it off.

If you want to be an engineer, get your degree."

"It has never been more difficult than it is today to grow on YouTube. As each day passes it will become more and more difficult. There are statistics to back up the fact that the top 3% of channels get 90% of views. The bottom 97% of channels are fighting over the remaining 10% of views. That‚Äôs just the way it is with the YouTube algorithm.

Is that a fight you are up for?  If so, just be prepared for a tough uphill battle that will take years to win.  I‚Äôve been full time on YouTube since 2011, and I can tell you that nothing feels better than taking the plunge."

It's good to see the spirits are still high with the Japanese kitsunes. I'm sure the concerts are still fun like before, especially in Japan, from the mosh'sh pit!

My biggest concern still is how the stage and the Kamis and the girls are presented. Most of the rest of us will be looking at it from our TV or computer screens without that added benefit of being in the pit, and a pit in Japan no less.

"&gt; Capitalism has always / does today literally depend on stealing resources from the poor countries and indigenous peoples of the world. The story of the British and French Empires is literally the entire history of capitalism.

This seems correct unless you disagree that capitalism is a global, and historically continuous system. And that therefore the capital accumulated from these historical events has culminated in the system as it exists today, and will forever be a part of global capitalism.

"&gt;By what mechanism would increased productivity lead to increased worker pay, benefits, working conditions, etc without a political movement driving government to mandate those changes? So productivity increases, which leads to increased profits for businesses. What is their incentive to just give those increased profits to the workers?

For the same reason anyone gets paid more than minimum wage - the fundamental economic principles of supply and demand. As a given line of business becomes more profitable, more people enter the market. More people entering the market means more demand for workers in that line of business. 

&gt;It certainly wasn't increased competition in the labor market. There aren't unemployment numbers going that far back, so we can't be sure exactly how tight the labor market was, but we do know when there were economic recessions, which are generally paired with high unemployment (and, therefore, an increased supply of labor).

That's exactly what it was. You do realize that the overall growth trend was positive despite periodic recessions, right?

&gt;The labor movement saw gains during both economic boom times (when demand for labor was high) and during recessions (when demand for labor was low).

OK, but that's neither here nor there - their political successes are not tied to economic successes or economic feasibility. It's possible for a labor movement to convince the legislature to pass a law mandating more compensation during a depression... businesses that can't afford it will just go under.

&gt; If it was the case that workers saw gains solely due to increased pressure on the labor market, then you would expect those gains to roll back, or at least pause, during recessions.

I think you're using a different definition of gain, or at least a looser one. A gain is an increase in real compensation. Nobody realistically believes that you'd be paying workers $80,000 a year but not let them take sick leave or vacation time - it's only people making $8,000 a year that would be in such a predicament. So when people go from making $52k a year with no vacation to making $48k a year + 4 weeks vacation, it might seem like a win but in reality the compensation is the same. Only now if you personally value $1000 more than a week off, you lose the option to choose $1000. The laws passed by labor movements can change the compensation bundle, but to the extent that the raise the value of the bundle altogether, they are going to be met with layoffs to some degree. Or businesses going under. "

"**Stanislav Petrov**

Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov (Russian: –°—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—Å–ª–∞ÃÅ–≤ –ï–≤–≥—Ä–∞ÃÅ—Ñ–æ–≤–∏—á –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æÃÅ–≤; 7 September 1939 ‚Äì 19 May 2017) was a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Defence Forces who became known as ""the man who single-handedly saved the world from nuclear war"" for his role in the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident. 

On 26 September 1983, three weeks after the Soviet military had shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, Petrov was the duty officer at the command center for the Oko nuclear early-warning system when the system reported that a missile had been launched from the United States, followed by up to five more. Petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm, and his decision to disobey orders, against Soviet military protocol, is credited with having prevented an erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the United States and its NATO allies that could have resulted in large-scale nuclear war. Investigation later confirmed that the Soviet satellite warning system had indeed malfunctioned.

"Magus is the first choice. You've got arcane magic and you can swing a sword in the same round.

Second choice would be either Bloodrager or Warpriest. Bloodrager has a bit more sword than spell than the other options but you've still got arcane casting and can cast buff spells on yourself when you enter a bloodrage. Warpriest is more of a prayer pike than spell sword since you've got divine magic and I wanted to keep the alliteration. You can cast spells on yourself as a swift action which is pretty nice and get good buffs to your armor and weapon with more swift actions."

"Account creation month : November last year

Money spent on game: $40-50 I buy the monthly pack only

Time spent on game : no idea since I would spend around 1-2 hours everyday and depending on the event more so can't tell.

Best TAC moments : Finding out that this game had collabs with other games/anime. As well as obtaining Double Gilgamesh from the fate collab (I've never got 5 star dupe in the same summon  until that point)

Worst TAC moments : Wasting 4500 gems on a banner that i thought had sakura,but ended up not being on the summoning pull until next week; Buying a character skin that I did not need...

Best Unit : In terms of power probably Laharl or Noctis, 

In terms of cuteness: Mia

Other notable units: Sakura, Neica, Rosa

Disappointing units: Oh man i have so many,but the biggest pain to see is when i pull a 5 star fraise.

One unit that evades me: Zain, Miuna, Aruba there are more but these are the ones I want.

What I'm looking forward to: Main and SSM storyline, despite what people say about the storyline I like it.

&gt;To be clear, you will still be arrested, but they will drop the case in court.

I am pretty sure it doesn't mean you will be arrested.  

It just means that if you are arrested under the statute, you have to prove what you are claiming to be true for it to be accepted in a court.

You can't just claim: ""I purchased this machine gun and have legally owned it since before the specified date.""

You actually have to provide proof, the burden of proof is on you and not on the state in this specific instance.

If a police officer ask you for proof that you can legally posses a machine gun and you provide paperwork at that time I highly doubt you'd be arrested.

"I kinda think it's a bit unhealthy. Some of the social and environmental activism movement can be a tad irrational. This in turn means they became a lot more religion despite the fact that it might seem irreligion. For one, there isn't much logical and rationality in the movement, as I said earlier. For social activism, their argument hinges on the crux that we should strive to live in an equal social structure with no discrimination. This argument ignore that when a society manages (as some manages), the effect of equality isn't as desired. This in turn changes their idealogue utopia as nothing but heaven and hell of religion - something that they hold up to, but would never exist in the first place."

* Malfurion dies instead of being saved. Tyrande invokes the Night Warrior, and kills Nathanos, and hundreds of innocent horde around her. Upon waking she feels she's no better than Sylvanas was, and goes on a path of redemption on her own. Suramar-level story arc begins here.
* The Alliance, post burning, lay siege to the Undercity. Goblin weaponry combined with Azerite and Plague are used to defend it. Most of the citizens die, wiping out a huge portion of the forsaken population, leaving mostly the players are actual population. Sylvanas flees with a few dark rangers, and the Horde is taken over by Gallywix, who lies about everything to get the position. 
* With Anduin dead, Gallywix in charge of the Horde, and Tyrande off doing her own thing, the only leaders left are Moira, Gelbin, Velen, and Genn. Genn is too angry, having run off for vengeance and MIA, Moira is busy raising her child and handling the three hammers (who don't agree on who should lead), and Velen is opposed to the war. Gelbin takes the stage. 

Cue BfA.

"How do you feel about the US prison system, which is larger both by population and as a percent of the total population, revolves around slave labor for private profit, further involves as a core feature the extraction of wealth from the working class through price gouging on basic amenities, involves a massive amount of grift to siphon taxpayer dollars into the hands of private contractors, involves rampant torture and sexual abuse by guards, consistent denial of basic medical care, not infrequent murder of prisoners by guards, and is primarily a tool of racial and political suppression aimed at crushing and fragmenting the working class and marginalized groups?

It even uses the same cute little euphemism (""correctional facilities"") that the Soviets did, and at the time the gulag system was running was absolutely on par or worse than it in terms of slave labor and brutality. The only difference is the climate and the fact that the US didn't have a war of extermination waged against it by genocidal capitalists (the vast majority of deaths in Soviet prisons occurred during WWII).

And yeah, ""the Soviets were nearly as bad as the US in this regard"" really isn't a glowing defense since the US is about tied with the Nazis for most evil and destructive power of the 20th century, but it's really disingenuous when people who wholeheartedly support US atrocities scream and cry about how evil it was that those other guys sort of did something almost as bad."

Much like the MOBA craze that happened when League of Legends exploded in popularity. It died down a bit, but DOTA2 and League are going absolutely nowhere.

"Ok, thanks! That gives a really good frame of reference. Hard fields definitely take a toll. Somewhat uncontrollable, depending on the weather that season, but more consistent some locations than others. Holes in the fields is a problem.

I think I'd probably rate the Winnipeg fields a 6 or 7 out of ten, based mostly on hardness and dry grass. I imagine in a wetter year, they could be quite good. Frisco, Sarasota, and Colorado Cup stand out as 10s. Most Columbus/Cincinnati sites a 10 or a 9. US Open in Blaine an 8 or so when I was there, due to wear and tear. 

A lot of polo fields I've played on are more in the 6-7 range. Naperville, Milwaukee, Cummings, GA. Blue Sky Polo in New York is more like an 8-9.

Sounding like maybe the bad fields were in that 6/10 range, and the better ones were somewhat higher?

"I have a very high libido that became non-existent and to a point where I thought there was something wrong with me.... turns out I was just dating an insensitive, selfish asshole who didn‚Äôt care to meet my needs. I cannot tell you how much something like this can destroy your sex drive. Resentment builds and becomes a constant. I ended up leaving so that I was able to find someone that was not only a better fit, but someone that actually cared about my needs. Now I‚Äôm in a new, healthy relationship and I cannot keep my hands off my guy. 

Also, another thing - I think it is a bit fucked up if this guy knew you weren‚Äôt as ‚Äúfreaky‚Äù as him and went on to marriage if there was any thought of it being a problem. Sexual compatibility is huge, but some people can deal with the differences. I‚Äôd either accept my partner for who they are and genuinely deal with the differences in a positive manner (or just get over it), try to work on it together if they were open to it, or decide it wouldn‚Äôt work before marriage. But to marry someone, hold this against them, and request a one sided open relationship? No no no no no. Don‚Äôt let him get away with this one... especially when he‚Äôs now making statements that sex drive isn‚Äôt good enough and your sexual engagement isn‚Äôt enough. He knew this before marriage!

Edit: I‚Äôd leave quick."

"Honestly, most of the wyrmprints aren't so powerful so as to be absolutely necessary. However, there are two situations where wyrmprints *do* become must-haves:

* During an event, or at least during either of the two events we've had so far, acquiring and equipping that event's wyrmprint is very important. For Loyalty's Requiem, that would be **Paladyn Defender**. For Trick or Treasure that would be **Plunder Pals**, and if you're willing to spend a ton of money, *Witch's Kitchen* and *Of Tricks and Treats* too.

* If you're wanting to do end-game content such as High Midgardsormr, you'll basically need to become a whale if you want to do it *right now* instead of months down the road like the rest of us. And when you get to that point, there's no specific *must-have* wyrmprint, because your wyrmprint choice should be decided by your team's needs, not by the tier list."

"That's basically where I stand. I understand why the classes can't keep getting new abilities every expansion--the level cap has gone from 60 to 120 and there's only so many active abilities you can give someone before their class is bloated with skills that are strictly inferior to other skills and similar problems.

I understand why it is the way it is, but at the same time, their solution isn't fun to play. People like new things and having your class stay mechanically the same from 110 to 120 is not fun. Many people play MMOs because the feeling of progression is addictive. Watching your ilvl go up in a game where traditionally, higher levels have always meant more skills just doesn't feel like progression, and it loses that addictive quality.

It's hard because I don't know enough to know how to solve the problem. I only know enough to know what the problem is and why it is that way."

"Heretical Thought: 

Neocons in 2000 weren't terribly sure who to vote for. Gore promised a continuation of Clinton's foreign policy -- which, among other things, featured an extreme reluctance to use force -- and Bush, while he wanted to restore American defenses, attacked Clinton for ""nation-building."" The Presidential candidate himself seemed to waffle on the issue, but Dick Cheney was far more direct; when news came out that Slobodan Milosevic had fallen, he told reporters, ""this still doesn't excuse Clinton's intervention in the Balkans."" 

Sure, the admin got (literally) Mugged by Reality, but Bush did campaign on non-interventionism, or at least against nation-building, and his early policies reflected that. Rumsfeld did everything he could to depose the Taliban with a ""small footprint"" and avoid reconstruction; one British commander called his plan for stabilizing Iraq, which featured less than half the number of troops the first Bush deployed there to kick Saddam out of Kuwait ""intellectually bankrupt."" Any administration would have been woefully unprepared to create two new liberal democracies from scratch when we had no formal state-building apparatus and our military was entirely optimized to deter great powers, but I do feel like the initial hostility of administration officials to nation-building -- based on the President's campaign promises -- contributed to some of our early failures in both countries.

So... maybe Gore would've been better. 

Bear with me, here. Sure Al Gore's economics weren't great, and he was probably even more gaffe-ridden than Bush, but if anything he had a more hawkish record than Clinton, and not one hostile to nation-building; he was one of the most prominent voices pushing for Balkan intervention. Sure, you can argue, absent 9/11 he would've represented the same sort of mushy liberal internationalism Clinton did, but remember: pre-9/11 Bush campaigned on a mild form of Fortress America. Gore too would've been Mugged by Reality. Certainly he would've invaded Afghanistan, and probably Iraq as well; it was American policy since 1998 to depose Saddam, Democrats had been issuing calls to do so, and there was credible intelligence that he was on his way to possessing nuclear weapons. When he kicked out IAEA inspectors, the Gore administration would have been forced to act. 

Moreover, not being so inherently hostile to nation-building, his appointees may have been more willing to commit to the civilian side of reconstruction and create actual plans for the political stabilization of the states we had liberated. There's an argument to be made that Neocons like Paul Wolfowitz wouldn't be in the administration to push for the use of force in Iraq, but neither would people like Rumsfeld. There's no guarantee here, I suppose; nobody really *liked* the idea of nation-building at the time, and Gore could well have avoided it more fervently than Bush, *buuuut...* 

Well, honestly, I think President Gore would've been the same as President Bush, just with slightly more spending and slightly fewer tax cuts. Most of Bush's greatest domestic policy ideas didn't pass, and I suspect Gore's appointees, surely more dovish overall than Bush's, would've avoided the hard work of reconstruction just as avidly as the worst offenders in the Bush administration.

"That's such an ethical swamp though, that I believe the moral choice is to do anything you can besides killing. There is a clear distinction I think between someone invading your home and declaring their intentions to slaughter you and your family, and the proactive form of defense that is oftentimes vaunted as the pinnacle of ethical duty in leftist circles. In the former example, you ought to take any precaution you are able to so as to ensure that the person invading is disabled and harmless - but I completely concede that such a thing is almost impossible outside of killing. In the latter example, assume that you live in a city where everyone but you votes to put you to death for no reason. What do you do? Do you kill everyone who voted to put you to death? Of course not, even though they all equally share responsibility for putting you to death for no reason, ""defending yourself"" in this context involves killing people who share 0.2% of the responsibility each. The most moral thing to do isn't to kill the slave-owner, it's everything you can do BESIDES kill the slave-owner. "

"Typical western armchair reporting. Equating the criticism of a famous slogan and merchandise from the misandryist community called [Womad](http://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20171120000951#cb), to accusing someone of promoting feminism. 

Korean radical feminists working in child care services already have been known for sexually molesting korean boys in pre school in the name of feminism. Funny how western media will keep calling Korea misogynist for rightfully being worried about Womad, until Womad members actually hurt some of their own prepubescent western children. Australian police arrested the woman who claimed to have drugged and raped an australian boy, posting his photos online illegally. Fortunately she was bluffing. But tell me if her acts dont cause revulsion. The Nazi symbol was originally a peace sign for Buddhism. Similarly, ""Girls can do anything"" is a great phrase. But its the slogan of Womad.

"*Cressida was silent for a good long while. Not because Arthur had said anything wrong; quite the opposite in fact, for his words struck her in the deepest way they could. So deep that it left her utterly speechless, as she couldn't find the words to express all that she was feeling. It was all too much. The truth to everything he had said was perhaps what surprised her the most and struck her the hardest. She felt horrible for ruining Arthur's morning by sharing what she had gone through and knew it was entirely too heavy for pleasant conversation, but she also felt unfathomably grateful for him; she had found that talking about what haunted her on a daily, really helped her process it all. And with all that Arthur had said... it helped that much more.*

*She couldn't meet his gaze, not when her eyes had begun to burn with the threat of tears. And as much as she tried her hardest to fight it, a few stray ones trickled down her cheeks, despite her efforts to push back the memories that had quickly surfaced. She might have wiped them away if she could trust her hands that were shaking too violently. She laid them on her lap beneath the table in hopes that Arthur hadn't noticed. Still, she tried to seem somewhat alright.*

*Cressida managed the smallest of smiles,* ""Thank you, Arthur. That... that really means a lot to me. I haven't told hardly anyone because I know how *heavy* it really is. Heavy to remember and equally so to tell. To carry. To know. I don't trust many people, but... I trust you."" *she wished she could say more, to maybe even reassure him that she was fine, but she doubted it would be convincing in the moment.*"

I know you are mostly interested in trying to get them to calm down for their sakes; less stress for them. But remember that they have had a rough few months and it will be okay if they are never hand tame, or if it takes years. You are doing your best at being a great bird mom and that is enough. 

I think the separate room idea is a good one, an easy test is to try it for a few days and listen. Happy budgies are noisy, and a calmer place may let them relax. I would probably suggest continuing to take a few minutes to talk to them with your hands behind your back every day, but give them some time (a few months?) before bringing them back into the bustle of the living room or similar. 

A partially covered cage could give them a respite too. 

If you live in a quiet place, soft music can help ease the ""It's too quiet, probably a predator"" innate fear. 

Covering the cage at night (if you don't already) may help them sleep better so they are less easily stressed. 

Finally, what's your budget? An aviary sounds perfect for them, maybe an outdoor one full of budgies from your area that need a good home given the lack of rescue? Even a large cage could fulfill this niche: they seem like they'd be happier in a flock. 

I had something like that as a kid, I was given a budgie or two from family friends looking for good homes, so we built an aviary and pretty quickly had others interested in giving up their budgies who they wanted better lives for. Hard to find that person, but not too difficult to be it if you have the resources and bird love that you obviously do. 

The things birds need to be happy are food, water, clean environments, opportunities to fly/exercise, and toys/stimulation. Humans can be involved, but if those needs are met without your company, they will be okay. 

You are obviously an incredible bird parent, willing to go the extra mile for them. But I think holding back for a bit, giving both you and your birds a break, could be very helpful. See how they do on a few trials and let them help guide your decisions that way. 

Best of luck!

"I think it's difficult to comprehend because I've been trading on exchanges for years and never needed a stablecoin. I use BTC to trade if an exchange doesn't allow fiat. A stablecoin, in my mind, doesn't give me any advantage because I would still need to buy it with BTC (unless you use the borrowing technique that another commenter described, which I don't really understand). 

A stablecoin doesn't, as far as I can tell, save me any steps or hassle, and it doesn't remove the requirement that I - at some point beforehand - had to use an exchange that allowed me to convert fiat into BTC. In fact it adds a step - you have to buy this coin, and presumably pay trading fees - and now you're stuck with a coin that is accepted by _fewer_ exchanges and merchants than the BTC you traded it for.

First and foremost: ""When I'm doing this process, what should I do or not do in order to be safe and not harm myself or others?"" The answers pretty much start with wear appropriate PPE - gloves, boots, steel toes, safety glasses, maybe faceshield or apron if handling concentrated chemicals, ear protection in the appropriate areas, I assume you're using ear protection around the centrifuge. You're in a hazardous environment, protect yourself from the hazards. Be aware of the systems you're using - before operating any valve or working with any clamp think ""Is it hot? Is it under pressure? Is it chemicals? Where is it coming from and where is it going to?"" Use good ergonomic form, avoid acute or repetitive strain situations. Communicate well with others in your working environment, be aware of forklift/other moving powered industrial truck traffic. If working with automated equipment, never reach inside of shielded areas when the equipment is running.

You can also ask yourself/trainer/boss/co-workers ""What should I do or not do, or what indicators should I pay attention to (SOPs/temperatures/gauges/meters/sounds/fittings leaking/etc) in order not to damage the equipment I'm using?""

You can also ask yourself/trainer/boss/co-workers ""What should I do or not do, or what indicators should I pay attention to (SOPs/task list/batch notes/recipe specs/temperatures/gauges/meters/sounds/fittings leaking/etc) in order to be confident that I'm maintaining product quality throughout the process that I'm doing?""

"&gt;it's perfectly reasonable to believe that there was something/someone behind our coming into existence

Something, sure. Someone, no.

&gt;A theist would sit in an empty room and claim that someone built it, and possibly try to look outside of the room.

The problem is determining whether what you think is a room is in fact a room at all. The only reason your analogy makes the theist sound reasonable is because we all have prior knowledge of human built structures including rooms. This is not analogous to the universe or reality since we do not have any reason or evidence to think that universes are something that needs to be created. We do have evidence that rooms are.

&gt;Atheists believe that there is no reason for belief in the unknown

Atheists don't believe that gods exist.

&gt; because we should only believe what we can support by empirical evidence.

I would just say evidence. It doesn't necessarily have to be empirical. I am open to anything that indicates that something is true regardless of whether it is empirical or not.

&gt;and since the room is empty, he would claim there is no reason to believe anyone else is around.

As i've explained above the initial question would be whether it was in fact a room or not.

Your analogy tries to equate a ""room"" with the universe presumably. This is obviously a horrible comparison. We have previous knowledge about rooms that would make one reasonable in coming to the conclusion that the room was built. We have no evidence that suggests the universe would need or have a ""designer"" or ""creator""."

"this seems a little harsh for something that's only 4 episodes in - at least, I'd encourage you to offer some more concrete examples of the weaknesses you see in the series. Sure, the backgrounds aren't special but the character design is appealing and it's capably animated. It's got a decent enough sense of humor which I'd say is generally better than average. The dull MC (at least dull so far) is set against more interesting female cast members which helps liven things up a bit - most of the viewing audience isn't here for him in the first place.

I think its greatest allure (and potential weakness when it fails to live up to it) is how much it's mirrored Monogatari in the first arc, Mai being essentially just Senjougahara with a better personality but also without the artistic flair or well-executed self-awareness that Monogatari benefits from. The resolution of her introductory arc felt rather cheesy in breaking the rules the show had set out for itself (however clumsy) ""because love"" but I think it's a little early to make large claims about character development. The scene where they're lying in bed together with blank expressions brought back unpleasant flashbacks of early-00's existential teen movies and felt kind of soul-draining (or maybe it was the missing moisture from all the dry dialogue) and pairing two fairly inexpressive characters seems like maybe not the best choice but I'd imagine the show will benefit from the expanding cast."

"Mmm, I'm still struggling not to come to the opposite conclusion, because while it makes sense, it would be one of those world-shattering insights. It does seem, though, rather like NTs have the pathological ability to tune out information they do not like, which is one, as an OCDer, I did not get. They care a lot about social approval even over the truth, and aren't at all conscientious.

I know it always varies, of course -I have a pretty committed vegetarian aunt with OCD, sadly. What a waste-, and I ain't picking on vegan NTs, but since no one can actually explain why vegans are wrong, it isn't as though they just drew different valid conclusions with the same information. So 'why us, though?' is a question that haunts me, and I'd be lying if I said I thought my neurology was absolutely zilch to do with it, in my own case."

"Well nobody really blamed the NRA for anything. The guy just said it's easy for kids to get their hands on guns here in America. Which is true. Half my friends when I was growing up had their own guns. I'm talking 13 year olds. My dad kept a pistol in an unlocked case on top the refrigerator and 3 different hunting rifles on the top shelf of the closet in his bedroom, each in soft cases with zippers. A kid accidentally brought his gun to his high school once because he had been hunting before school that morning and forgot to take it out of his toolbox on his truck. You can say these people are stupid all you want but that doesn't change the reality of what happens daily. "
"&gt; If you were hooked up to another person's body for dialysis, I would argue that the government cannot force you to stay there for 9 months against your will.

Yes, but if I were to hook myself up to another person's body for dialysis it would be with the implicit or explicit stipulation that I was helping them in that moment, not accepting unconditional responsibility for their life. That would absolutely be a condition of my assistance.

And if I did unconditionally accept responsibility for another person's life then, yes, I do think it would be wrong for me to neglect that responsibility. And in certain cases, I do think it would be proper for the government to either ensure that I lived up to that obligation, to take over for me if I was incapable of doing so, or to punish me for wantonly neglecting to if it was plainly in my power to keep it. And so much more so should I be held to account if failing to keep an unconditional obligation necessarily led to the death of the person to which I was obliged.

Of course this is absurd because nobody puts themselves in the position of accepting absolute responsibility for another person's being. It's not obvious to me that the law even allows for such an obligation to be assumed by one person over another, but I'd have to think it through more. Especially, once a person reaches maturity, they are always primarily responsible for themselves. Perhaps a relevant example would be a surgeon quitting mid-surgery? I'd have to think it through more.

In this sense unborn humans are quite unique, in that they are absolutely and unconditionally dependent on their mothers. And that whatever degree to which their mother was a willing participant in their conception, their dependency on their mother is infinitely less chosen--since prior to existing they have no choices at all.

&gt; It's not really a question of dependency, but of the government not having the right to force you to use your body to sustain others.

No. It's not really a question of the government having the right to force you to use your body to sustain others, but of the government acknowledging that unborn humans are uniquely totally dependent upon their mothers. And that mothers' don't have the right to destroy their dependents because it is inconvenient^*.

I don't generally argue from the perspective that abortion should be prosecuted as murder in all cases. My concern is more that people acknowledge that it is basically unknowable whether unborn humans are persons. I believe that since we're not sure they should be presumed to be persons and extended the reasonable protection of government, all the more taking into consideration that they are completely defenseless, besides.

But the basic fact is that government is entirely incapable in any meaningfully direct or overt or punitive sense of protecting unborn children in the same way that they protect adults, children or even babies without quickly becoming a dystopic nightmare. What they can do, however, is not facilitate and even discourage abortion.

What we as a society can do is agree that mother's have a responsibility towards their unborn children that government can't rigidly enforce but should nonetheless acknowledge and not contravene.

------

*

(**EDIT:** I'm not trying to trivialize the nature of the inconvenience; I know pregnancies can be very burdensome, painful, and even health- or life-threatening. I think that there is a reasonable basis for saving the life of a mother, where the fetus may incidentally die as a consequence. I just don't think that the bodily autonomy of a mother can be said to trump the life of the child, trivially. And I certainly don't think abortion should be unrestrained.)

"I try not to judge others when it comes to an education.  That said, researching markets and employee demand is essential when selecting an education path.  You‚Äôd be surprised what demand some specialized degrees actually have though - plus, some people chose a path based off of interest or passion rather than money.  As long as they go in to it researched and prepared for reality upon graduation, they are welcome and encouraged to study whatever the hell they want.  Finally, many positions required a degree but not necessarily a particular one.  All forms of education (including trade) foster the development of life skills essential to employment success - such as reading comprehension, written and oral communication, and logical assessment.   

I lucked out - I was passionate about geology, blasting, and building things.  Through my education I discovered further interests in specialities like ventilation and medical response.  Mining engineering was a logical conclusion for me.  Art history or criminal justice or Japanese dance might be the logical conclusion for someone else - they just need to have a realistic plan post graduation.

"&gt;because the west DEMANDS it. China cutting down from producing literally does nothing since then someone else will pick it up again.

But that's the point - it can't just be the west saying they will lower their carbon emissions per capita, all countries need to, that's why we need total international cooperation on these things. OF course, the west needs to massively reduce consumption habits, but everywhere else has to limit their emissions *as well*. 

&gt;carbon footprint is that they are gaining access to more consumer goods, specifically red meat and electronics, so we also need to answer how can we demand they stop eating meat / buying phones and the like, when we're not likely to do the same.

Yes, the west needs to address their overconsumption habits, but it's also true that everywhere else needs to limit their consumption aspirations. Even if the whole world had the emissions per capita of one of those countries with small industries, it is still much too high. If we look at a 2030 goal of a global 48% emissions reduction (called for by the IPCC in the recent SR1.5), then we are looking at an average emission per capita of ~ 3.3 Gt/year. That's about the same per capita emissions as Algeria, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Cuba, Latvia, Romania, or Uzbekistan and less than Argentina, Mexico, or Venezuela (2013). "

"Probably yes, but many characters, including Shadow and Irvine, have conditional, temporary stuff that can definitely impact performance, but it's borderline impossible to calculate. While buffs ""at start of battle"" are definitely more predictable and could have been counted, the difference would be mostly minimal. Prishe gets to around 150 higher than Irvine and Shadow in best case scenario which, because of damage formula, equals around 100 extra brv damage on normal attacks. On battles that last less than 3 of a character's turns, this is negligible. However, in boss battles like WoI the higher base stats are going to be better over time. In general, I didn't count situational and temporary stuff, only permanent ones."

"Here's what happened:
   
You started the match 6-7 minutes before payout. You finished the match with 55 seconds left.  
    
What happened during those 55 seconds or even before that:  
- While you were in combat, someone (doesn't matter who) started a fight with you. BUT that person is also being hit by someone.   
   
Whoever finishes their attack LAST gets sling shotted furthest. You were at 6th, so someone at 7-10th hit you, but they too were hit by someone 11-14th, possibly a 3rd attacker.   
   
Example:   
Player A finishes attack at 5:59:05 and sees rank 6th.  
Player B (rank 10th) attacks Player A and finishes attack at 5:59:1x and sees rank 6th.  
Player C (rank 14th) attacks Player B and finishes attack at 5:59:2x and sees rank 6th.  
Player D (rank 18th) attacks Player C and finishes attack at 5:59:5x and see rank 6th.  
   
End Result:  
Player D - Rank 6th   
Player C - Rank 10th  
Player B - Rank 14th  
Player A - Rank 18th    
     
The results may vary depending on latency/delay/etc. but whoever finishes their attack FIRST gets the short end of the stick which is you. The other players just know the system and have delayed finishing their attack until the very last second.

"I'm right there with you,  I've been homeless and I've been ill from no heroin and although I was lucky enough that I never prosituted myself or committed crimes personally I know that many many did, I was just in a situation where I didn't have to because I had someone who took all the risks and took care of me.

That's why if I see someone ill I give them the five bucks.    They aren't going to quit if I don't give them that money.  They are going to get it one way or the other. All I'm doing is cutting down the time they are in physical withdrawal and showing them that it can get better out here.

"Men have unrestricted bodily autonomy, no one gets to decide if a man should be an incubator to another life form against his will.

It is not legal to strap you to a table and force you to be a dialysis machine for another human being, most consider it morally repugnant if the state decides to forcibly take one of your kidneys or a bud of your liver to save another human life (The state is not even allowed to take your blood by force outside of very, very specific circumstances). However women, uniquely, can be forced to function as an incubator for another human life against her will. "

"Gonna break this down for you then. it's gonna involve some math and some general stat trends but it wont be too tough.

&gt; It‚Äôs not only slow but also telegraphs to the linemen that he‚Äôs throwing which gives plenty of time to either swarm to the direction he‚Äôs throwing as well swat the ball down at the line of scrimmage.

Well. His throw takes .227 Seconds About for any short-intermediate route. his windup increased on long passes and maybe for certain types of balls (like over the shoulder passes or whatever that need a different arc). but straight passes, about .227 seconds. If you are wondering how i timed this. literally went frame by frame and counted. There a margin of error in there but it'll exist for every QB. Tom Brady, who has one of the fastest releases, is about .200 even.  Bortles is relatively on the slow side, so QBs probably in general range from .190 to .240 from absolute fastest to slowest for regular passing.  Thats from bortles to brady is .027 seconds. or 1/37th of a second. 

An NHL hockey goalie reaction time is ~0.130. They are generally tested to be the 2nd fastest reaction time of any Sports Competitor (NASCAR drivers test highest). assuming all D lineman have Goalie Reaction speed (they have slower because they dont train for it specifically), for a D lineman to go off PURE reaction (not anticipation but reaction), they have at best a .07s window for Brady and a .097 window for bortles or just under 1/10th a second for bortles. vs 1/14th for brady. The difference isnt enough to cause a dramatic change in number of swatted balls, nor to swarm. A DB reacting to bortles, if they run a 4.3 40, means they can make it about 2.9mm further reacting to bortles vs Brady. 

reaction Doesnt cause Tipped balls or defensive swarming. Anticipation does. Period. Thats why looking defenders off, pump fakes, etc work so well. they are trying to anticipate the throw based on body language and head movement. 

As for tipped balls in general, i've said before, and its still true. offensive line play has more to do with tipped balls than QB play. Quarterbacks like Fitzpatrick bounce all over the place in tipped ball count depending on the team they play for,  QBs like Carr were worst in the league when his line was bad his rookie year, he dropped tipped balls to best in league when his line was the best.  Its an O line think more than QB. Qb does have a SMALL factor. but its mostly O line play. Every tipped ball the first three weeks this year were achieved by the D lineman going 1 on 1 vs brandon linders backup. and thats not coincidence. Where linder would keep their hands down, his backup failed.  Since there have been some 1 on 1 tipped balls, and those are the ones that are on QB. and mostly on the QB for not pump faking rather than their throwing motion.

&gt;  It also makes him vulnerable to fumbles which he‚Äôs prone to

Well im not sure this is true, while having th ball down by your waist is a good way to get it stripped, Bortles actually, per QB hit, doesnt fumble very often at all. Derek Carr for example fumbles at twice his rate, Rodgers fumbles about halfway in between the two by rate, and Cam newton fumbles less. Bortles does Appear to fumble the ball a lot over his career. his total fumbles are high. But thats because hes been hit a lot. not because he's somehow prone to fumbling, he's prone to having very poor O lines, but thats not really a fault of his throwing motion, more his team and bad luck (in the case of this season). 


I'd argue while the jags might be ""designed"" for a QB more like kessler, I think they need someone who is MUCH better at doing what kessler does for him to be better than bortles in Hacketts System. Someone like Alex Smith as of last season. A Mobile guy who knows how to avoid pressure and is very good at the short passing game, but has a deep ball that isnt a joke so safeties cant just crowd the box and shut down everything like they can vs kessler.

"I mean, they might do something in order to maintain legitimacy. But this is the type of infraction that would cause them to give the 'death penalty' to many programs. 


I think this will be just like football. SMU and USC commit basically the same infractions. For SMU, they make them completely shut down their program for a year, stop all their scholarships, and severely penalize them for subsequent years. For USC, they give them a postseason ban during two years where they're bad anyway, and make them give up 10 scholarships a year... out of 85 total allowed.



It's going to be the same thing here. If this were just Creighton, then the NCAA would shut down the program for a year, vacate their entire history, and lose like 50 scholarships over 10 years. Since KU and a few others are involved, they're probably going to vacate a few past wins, downplay the severity of the incident, and maybe take away one scholarship for a year.


They'll do something to maintain their legitimacy as a governing body, but it will be nowhere near what they would have done if it were some peon school committing the infractions."

However, I would caution you about going to school in California. I have heard that many institutions in CA are less likely to give out tuition remission to grad students because the demand to go to school there is so high. In my opinion you should definitely look for a program that DOES offer you such a benefit, so you might be better off exploring programs elsewhere for that reason alone.

"No it never has. He correct his original statement because he got the days confused. Does that make him a liar. Does that make him untrustworthy? He had so much going through his head at that time im sure of. He knew he was the main suspect, and they were only focused on him. That would rattle anyone, too go through this again, on a whole nother set of circumstances. He never said he didn't have a fire, he just couldn't remember what day it was. That is not changing your story. So i disagree. Fact of the matter is if that's all you got to point out, that's ridiculous to think his story changed because he didn't actually remember what day he had the fire on. Really? The statement i wrote wasn't to have a debate on who's telling the truth here. It's to point out who's story had significantly changed since day one. The fact that Avery's story has always remained the same, never changing direction, is most certainly a fact whether you, or anyone believe different. You can't fault the man for forgetting under pressure. Again he never denied not having a fire. Alway's has got to be someone to dispute the fact's. What about all the bullshit from everyone else, the magnitude of corruption,  yet you point out a simple mistake. The one, and only simple mistake. What else has had changed in his story? I bet you can't find any other change to the man's story, than that sorry excuse to disprove, or dispute someone a liar. "
"&gt; I wonder how the game define ""fight""

I can see a few ways to do it.

* At least X abilities (or autos) by at least Y heroes within Z seconds. Consider the difference between Red Kael'thas throwing out Q and W to poke and being responded to by Blue Nazeebo tossing spiders at him, vs Red Sonya leaping in and using Whirlwind, which Blue Uther stuns to interrupt while Blue Raynor autoattacks her three times, and at the same time Red Muradin misses a Storm Bolt. **This could also count double (or higher) for (most) heroics.**

* At least X heroes within Y proximity of each other, particularly melee heroes. Blue Nazeebo throwing spiders from his gate while Red Sonya farms a minion wave is probably just poking. But if Red Sonya is within AA range of Blue Nazeebo, that's more likely to start a skirmish.

* Certain heroes landing a combo is more likely to turn into a skirmish than remain poke. Consider a full Kerrigan, Alarak, or KTZ combo, for example, vs Jaina getting a hit of Blizzard and a Q or two.

* Fewer than X deaths in Y seconds. Poke is less likely to directly result in deaths (though it often leads to skirmishes which leads to deaths), so if someone dies it's less likely to be poke.

I don't know without someone looking at the coding, but those are a few ways I can think of to judge."

Doing something like that certainly wouldn't drive some women to suicide or drug abuse in a way of coping with being haunted by whether or not their baby will have a good life or be raised to be a good person.

None of that is my own opinion, i haven't even played it. Just interpreting what people are saying.

"&gt; well, you have to show evidence for it.

Why do you suddenly have such a high standard when the claim isn't coming from the pulpit? 

There's no evidence of gods existing, only people making them up. The same has been done in plenty of cultures, the Native Australians don't know how the world got here so they dreamt up the a rainbow serpent and the dreamtime, Romans didn't understand volcanoes and the behaviour of the ocean so they pinned it on anthropomorphizations that they are comfortable with such as Vulcan and Neptune. 

It's the arrogance of religious people that they can see this self-evident trait of religious mythology in every other religion but insist that it's not so in their own special case.

So we've established the, ""I don't understand therefore it was done by a mythical creature"" part as a bit of bad thinking inherent in religions, the ""my mythical creature not yours"" isn't necessarily part of all religions but is definitely part of the Christian one, do I need to point out instances of your god's jealousy and insistence that he's the only genuine god? (which is also evidence for **him** being an anthropomorphization) The anti-masturbation part is often defended in reference to the Oman story, but he was murdered for disobeying in my opinion (which doesn't make the god any less morally repugnant in the story), I may even be convinced that the anti-masturbation message isn't overtly in the Bible however it's definitely pushed by the major sects of Christianity so I'm sticking with it."

Rank REALLY needs to be fixed and it can really take off, if the proper love is put into it. I haven't met anyone who hates the destiny gunplay, however some won't even touch PvP because of the matchmaking.  


 

**Ranking:**  
I want to say look at league of legends and have ranks similar to them with your own names, however you do. I just forget because it doesn't seem to mean anything. I match with major sweats and really good people and I'm only 1300 glory. It sucks and it is a reason so many are turned away. In league you almost always feel equal while getting better. **There should not be quests for obtaining certain glory.** High glory should be for high elo players. Your first 10 matches should judge where you are placed(or something similar). There should be no shame for a low glory, because what is fun is beating someone who is more or less your equal skill. Also slowly improving at the game. Higher rank is nice, and a goal but it shouldn't be the primary, winning and getting better should, because skill should reflect your rank, currently it does not.

* If you play with lower glory players, you should gain less and lose a lot more.
* If you play with higher glory you should earn a modest increase and lose a modest amount.

Competitive sucks, because it is a ladder. It is not ranked gameplay and you have nothing inbetween. Quickplay is little strategy and means little towards trials. Competitive is for the top players and even then it's hardly fun for most and low pop. Everyone is looking for carries and not to improve. A want for improvement brings a lot more game time and play time which is what everyone including you guys want.

**This in my opinion is the most important failure in PvP. If you feel like a match, you should be able to jump into a match without much thought and expect to have a fun challenge. If you listen to anything please listen to this.** I truly think this would increase the player base in comp immensely even overall. There is currently not much to aim for in comp. I have a few friends max glory. They are good for sure, however they are not the best of the best and top ranks should be reserved for them.  


I could only imagine what a free 2 week trial, and a solid competitive ranked system could bring. Done right, Destiny PvP could survive without the rest of the game, and that is how it should aim to be. Not the added event that MMO's put in for a change of pace."

"So I'm a married female, identify ""publicly"" as heterosexual. I am attracted to, and my husband is super okay/encouraging about my sexual relationships with women. Why do I publicly identify as heterosexual? Because quite frankly it's not everyone's business. They don't need to know and I don't feel like I need to tell them, I'm sure anyone else has a bunch of hobbies/extra curricular activities that I'm not aware about and I don't care. I don't ""act"" any particular way to satisfy anyone, I don't ""act"" at all. I am who I am and don't care what other's think or assume. The people that feel the way I do, wether colleagues, friends of friends, or people on the street usually make a mutual connection with our vibe. Those that I think are genuinely straight, don't notice anything. Then of course, you make plenty of completely straight friends who just accept what you do, of course they probably have some interests that don't interest me either. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's good that you don't feel the need to come out, as I've explained I don't think it's necessary either. I'm interested in the fact that you say you ""act"" straight. I think there's definitely some repression from yourself here, I don't think that many people are forced to ""act"" any particular way these days. Usually if you are it's because of religious family, so why are you feeling the need to ""act"" a particular way and to who? 

&amp;#x200B;

I might add that I am 28 and come from a very non-religious background. Too be honest, despite what I've said I have never publicly identified as anything and no one has ever asked. The closest that has come to ask is girls that are interested in me and learn that I'm married beforehand, basically asking me if I'm DTF."

I'm going to try 3 prong folders to keep track of classwork. I don't do homework but even classwork seems to difficult for them to submit sometimes! I'm thinking if I setup a spot in the room for the folders then stuff won't disappear as much!

"I was homeless for a pretty decent amount of time.

I never panhandled, but I ate anything that was offered to me out of kindness and was incredibly grateful for it.

Nobody owed me anything and I was in no position to be finicky about what I got.

There are plenty of resources for the homeless to take advantage of and if they don't, its more than likely because they have already used every resource available to ride on the money train for their addiction.

Like it or not, the VAST majority of people are there because of their own addiction, refusal to take serious steps to get real help and they know how to work you. Its not their first time around the block and they know they can easily throw your offering back in your face and hit up somebody else until they get what they want.

There are a very, very small percentage of people who genuinely need help and those are the ones that will gladly accept anything even if its not cash. 

And it goes both ways. We don't have to take crap from panhandlers just because they don't approve of whatever free item is being given. I'm not obligated to provide fine dining to people who would rather spit on my modest sandwich or granola bar. 

I don't care how shitty this makes me look. I know what I'm talking about and have lived on the streets. Be grateful or get the fuck out. "

I can understand no good alignments, but why not LN? There‚Äôs not a single class which excludes a single alignment like that.

Heal should be a class skill if they deal with bodies all the time.

Simple Fleshwarping needs a saving throw listed. It‚Äôs also gained at both 1st &amp; 5th level, which must be a typo.

Ritual casting needs to be removed. I haven‚Äôt even seen the spell list but endless spell slots at no cost whatsoever cannot be allowed in Pathfinder. (And after looking at the spell list, it *definitely* can‚Äôt keep Ritual Casting).

Evolved Shape is okay, but it‚Äôs actually somewhat dull. It‚Äôs apparent the whole class is limited. Look at the chart of class features, and remove the ‚ÄúEvolved Shape [X/day]‚Äù and see how empty it becomes.

Ancient Tongue is amusing for a short time but it‚Äôs far too specific. Very few characters would enjoy having this *exact* alteration occur partway into a campaign for almost no reason, and then restricting its use to only disarm with a 3/4 BAB class makes it irrelevant. It‚Äôs like leveling up and gaining nothing but a single skill point and an ordinary long spear, but it‚Äôs *even less than that*.

"It would depend on how the training is done and tracked. I can't say I know firsthand on it, but in general, whoever handles training could do it by dog, by handler, or both. There might not be any such thing as a ""dog's training records,"" meaning you have to get the handler's records, which would (hopefully) indicate training with the dog in question.

Not sure how the laws are written either, but it could be if a handler wasn't trained on the dog (meaning the handler was trained on another dog, or not at all), it's possible that alone would be enough for a dismissal in some states.

I guess it would be based on how the state defines how drug tracking is classified. Do they base it solely on whether the dog can detect the drugs? Is the competence of the handler a factor? Do they require demonstrated proof of ability during a trial? A lot of that stuff would be varied greatly from state to state, I imagine."

After 10 minutes more minutes (40 total supposedly) they let me cool down and then added bleach to my hair and left me. Then we finally put dye on for 30 minutes and washed it out.

"You've accurately shown that, if you roll two independent d20s, you'll get an average difference of ~6.64. However, I don't think that's a particularly useful way of analyzing things, since it sort of inherently assumes that you always would have rolled the lower number first, and the higher roll is a result of getting advantage. Presumably, half of the time you would actually have gotten the higher number first, so advantage wouldn't have boosted your result at all. If you ignore half of your values, you'd presumably half your average difference of 6.64 to 3.32, which happens to be the exact different between the average value of rolling 1d20 (10.5), and rolling it with advantage (13.82)."

"&gt;If you don't need rules for roleplaying, every game is a roleplaying game. And if every game is a RPG, then none of them are.

That makes zero sense and fails to follow your premise. Not every game is set up to allow for roleplaying. I mean, you could roleplay while playing chess or Monopoly, but it's not a game that's set up for that. D&amp;D is. 

&gt;So if that's the case we can no longer use ""RPG"" to describe a game and must define it by what it is about.

It's about making a character, using the rules presented, and then role-playing that character in various circumstances. Some of those circumstances are, indeed, about killing monsters. Some of them aren't. But at no point is D&amp;D *only* about killing monsters."

"I have been practicing practicing practicing at stopping.
I NEED a timer that allows me to snooze 5 more minutes, and I often go through quite a few, but I am definitely getting better with real practice.
One thing I have seen is that you must change physical spaces (rooms).
Go get a drink or some food (I never eat or drink while focusing)
People have recommended putting a timer in the other room. That would probably help, but I don't want to ;)

But physically getting up and changing spots does make it much easier.

Also, with 25/5, it's surprising how much of a movie you can watch or book you can read, and how much easier it is to break for something enjoyable. Probably teaches task switching too.

Also, paying attention to the fact that I really aren't as good at what I'm doing when I don't take breaks is helping a bit. 

Anyway, PRACTICE is what's helping me :)

"&gt;Entropy can be looked at as chaos or order depending on your perspective

Not really. Entropy has a specific definition in this context. In order to avoid confusing everyone, it is basically how many possible states there are for the parts that make up a whole. Thermodynamics tells us that natural order is from low entropy to high entropy. A house of cards has a set number of possible locations for those cards in order to remain standing. A pile of cards that used to be in the shape of a house has a far greater set of possible locations for each card. The more specific the possible arrangements of a set, the less chaotic it is, the more ordered it is. 

In the case of universal heat death, entropy increases asymptotically towards infinity. The universe is generally accepted to have finite matter and energy, so there will never be an equal distance between particles, they will all simply be getting further and further apart, approaching but never achieving an infinite distance."

"Spot on with the problem. You are referring to what is sometimes called the ""first-mile/last-mile"" problem in public transportation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Travel typically looks like home -&gt; first-mile -&gt; transportation hub like Caltrain/BART -&gt; last-mile -&gt; office. In crowded areas like big city downtown or Asian metro cities (Tokyo, say), the sheer density of people in those areas allow this problem to be solved with frequent buses/trams. But in suburban cities like San Jose / Santa Clara, it is probably not very economical to run frequent connections to all the sprawling, low-density suburbs. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's an added issue that the last-mile transit scarcity and its effect - the crowded freeways - may show up in different places (Morgan Hill, say, and Santa Clara 101 respectively), so a lot of high level planning and coordination is required."

"You'll remember how in 2012 you guys won the tiebreaker over us to play in the SEC Championship, lost a really close game, and then we got a better bowl game than you because, basically, we didn't have to play (and lose) an extra game on the schedule, which is kinda BS. You guys should've been in the Sugar Bowl at a minimum that year. 

As for us this year, well, I don't think we're gonna win on Saturday anyway so it's a moot point, but, as far as the prospect of going to Atlanta and getting detonated by Alabama, well, it's not fun to think about but it is what it is. The only problem is that Florida fans were probably thinking ""well, at least getting there = more exposure"" under Mac as well and that obviously didn't translate, no thanks to the fact that Mac __SUCKED__ but nevertheless I'm just a bit wary of that angle of it by now. I believe in Mullen but I've seen enough unsustained resurrections that I'm not going to believe Florida is actually, finally, ""back"" until we see them playing with, and beating, top teams on a regular basis (or Florida State, for that matter; 0-5 since 2012 and 1-7 since 2010 is embarassing and a stain on the program)."

"You're on the right track - dogs aren't going to solve your problems.   Right now, you think you see dogs as the solution to your problem, but they are only a temporary band-aid that create other, deeper problems in your life, like unaddressed emotional issues and an unhappy husband.

Your psychologist is failing you.  What he needs to do is help you deal with your problems from the inside out.  If he's telling you that you should just get another dog if you think that'd make you happy - even though you know that ultimately it won't - then he doesn't sound very qualified.  It sounds like YOU know this, but your psychologist is a person in a position of authority, and he is saying it so you feel he's giving you permission.   

You need to demand better of your psychologist.  Tell him that you need to find happiness within yourself, and you need to find it without the assistance of a dog, because that's only a problem masker, not a problem solver. 

If your husband is the most important person in your life, then you need to choose him and his happiness and his HEALTH and figure out how to do this dog-free, forever.  If he's not the highest priority, and you are going choose this dog or future dog ownership, then that's a hard truth that you need to be up front with him about it and be ready for the fallout. If you're choosing dog ownership over him, then he needs to be given the option to find someone whose values are more in line with his.

As for Maka, take her to the pound and don't look back.  Just assume that she's going to be adopted out, but whatever happens, that's on the pound and not on you.  If you continue to subject your husband to the misery of constant contact with a known allergen, then that IS on you."

"You are aware that a temple marriage is an eternal marriage, correct?  Does that inspire you, is that what you want with her?

What is the ideal compromise here?  You won't be baptised, and would have to wait a year you were anyway to get your endowment and be married in the Temple if you decided.  Does she have to compromise on her goal to be married in the Temple? 

It sounds to me like you want different things.  She wants Temple marriage and Gospel life, you can't because of family reasons.  A lot of conflict there.  She has to either drop the Temple stuff, carry on with her faith as it is and let you do what you want to do. You get married outside the temple and make a life together.  If she has hopes and dreams that you will be baptised one day she needs to keep that in the closet and let you decide your own life for yourself.  If she doesn't it may cause strain in the relationship.  

Or she can find someone that is a member of the church and that wants to be married in the Temple, and take that path.  

She can't force or guilt you into the church and I don't think she should be placed with an ultimatum to leave the church.

"Guilters here are split about even.  Truthers here are at least 75% female. This is not uncommon.

With male prisoners you have more women even when the guys are fat and ugly. The number of women who date and marry prisoners is actually astounding as well. 

Cases where people genuinely are screwed over like Knox and Faria are more even in numbers but not always, a lot of times women who get screwed over have fewer female supporters (Hilberling for example). That is actually odd to me since so any women say they want to stand together... The largest gaps one way or the other genderwise tend to be cases where no MOJ occurred.

"&gt;Well, I don't agree with that. Chuck E. Cheese's have the same animatronics because they're meant to be the same. In this fictional universe, two locations that are named differently, exist in different locations. 

But both of these locations are meant to be owned by the same company and the characters are meant to be a big group of friends. Look at Fredbear &amp; Friends from FNaF4, Fredbear is shown with the Freddy‚Äôs gang. This is a pretty clear indicator that these characters are meant to be together. Having them together on the TV but completely separate at the restaurants wouldn‚Äôt make sense. The only reason Freddy and crew aren‚Äôt at Fredbear‚Äôs is because Fredbear‚Äôs came before Freddy was an idea. 

&gt;We have no right to assume that fazbear entertainment spans as far as Chuck E. Cheese. We are to assume that the locations we see and hear of are that of their own unique state, and Freddy Fazbears isn't something that you could find across multiple states. 

Well of course, the whole thing is owned by two people who operate out of their houses. Freddy‚Äôs was always shown as a small, local place since FNaF1. I never said it was a huge chain. And them being so close would obviously lead to some serious overlap of branding, advertisement, and customer base. 

&gt;What this means, in canon, is that for some reason, there are copies of both animatronic suits, at a location that is branded differently. It's canon, and I don't think that makes much sense from a storytelling perspective. I mean, I doubt you'd find a billy bob animatronic in the back of a Chuck E. Cheese.

But, that‚Äôs just the thing. They aren't branded differently. Sure, they have different names, and Fredbear‚Äôs lacks Freddy, but, as I said, Fredbear &amp; Friends shows us that Fazbear Entertainment was packaging these characters as a whole package, they were made to be together. Billy Bob and Chuck-e aren‚Äôt meant to go hand-in-hand, Fredbear and Freddy are. 

&gt;And on the Marionette thing, that still doesn't make sense. So what that they're a different color? So what if they were the first?

It makes her special. It shows us that there is something different about her and that she is more of a force to be reckoned with than the other animatronics we face against. She‚Äôs the first victim, she‚Äôs the protector of the children, and she always comes back. 

&gt;You think Marionette sounds vengeful in UCN? It's most likely that they aren't even real in Ultimate Custom Night, Marionette themselves states that they don't hate you, in one of their voice lines. 

Well, ignoring the fact that I never said or cliamed that,  it‚Äôs pretty clear that UCN has multiple souls within its walls. Withered Bonnie ponders whether the place is a new prison for him, Withered Chica talks about how she was the first to die in the MCI, we hear Elizebeth/Baby talking behind some of the Mediocres‚Äô voice lines, and the Puppet‚Äôs line about not hating the player is a new development and not something that could be reflected from the past Puppet. As for the Puppet stating that they don‚Äôt hate the player, it‚Äôs pretty clear that she still has some vandetta against the player, as she also says, ‚ÄúSeeing you powerless is like music to me‚Äù. 

&gt;If you want vengeful, look at the obvious Nightmare animatronics.

I‚Äôd argue to say they‚Äôre less venegeful, and more overly monstrous and evil, like nightmares should be. 

&gt;On the remnant tidbit, since it is fueled by the victims, then it wouldn't be the Marionette 'giving life.' It would give them no special powers.

Well, yeah. It‚Äôs less of a special power and more of a special role. She‚Äôs the one that gives them the gift of life by bringing their bodies over to the suits. She doesn‚Äôt just resurrect them from the dead like you previously theorized GF did with BV. 

&gt;Cassidy however, while being in a powerless husk, with presumably no endoskeleton, induced hallucinations that affected real building structure, and could downright kill the player, in both games. (FNaF2 with a flying head, no less.) Cassidy can also partially move Golden Freddy, as evident in the 49/20 UCN cutscene.

Yes, but Charlie is shown to be equally anomalous. While being in an animatronic that shouldn't be able to walk at all, she can go through the building without being seen at impossible speeds and kill you, all while causing hallucinations to pop up on the cameras. I‚Äôd argue to say that‚Äôs a lot more impressive than twitching. 

&gt;And since you brought out a tidbit from the book, I will as well. Remember how in the fourth closet, William Afton is alive, even after being springtrapped? He had it removed. He recovered from a Springlock accident, and even though SpringTrap wasn't rotting for as long as he does in FNaF3, you can't tell me that it doesn't validate the sheer durability humans have in these universes.

Durability doesn‚Äôt really matter all that much once your heart stops. Sure, by some miracle of science and nature, possibly using remnant, William manages to avoid death. But, that is avoiding death. As I‚Äôve said, we hear the beep on the heart monitor, BV‚Äôs heart stopped, he‚Äôs dead.

"They will, because theres no way the lawsuit will hold any water whatsoever. It's a hail Mary from Breitbart to try and stop hemorrhaging advertisers. 


However, let's see how it *could* hold merit, in case their legal team is crowdsourcing ideas from reddit:


&gt;The letter lists a number of potential options for a civil lawsuit against Sleeping Giants, including tortious interference and fraud.


Well, for fraud, since it's easier:

&gt;In common law jurisdictions, as a civil wrong, fraud is a¬†tort. While the precise definitions and requirements of proof vary among jurisdictions, the requisite elements of fraud as a tort generally are the intentional misrepresentation or concealment of an important fact upon which the victim is meant to rely, and in fact does rely, to the harm of the victim.[3]¬†Proving fraud in a court of law is often said to be difficult.[citation needed]¬†That difficulty is found, for instance, in that each and every one of the elements of fraud must be proven, that the elements include proving the states of mind of the perpetrator and the victim, and that some jurisdictions require the victim to prove fraud by¬†clear and convincing evidence.



The fraud would occur specifically if the Sleeping Giants misrepresented the meaning of a headline and the content of the posts that the advertisements occurred side by side with. This is where Breitbart would have to prove that they intentionally misled advertisers as to the content of their website when they contacted them. It requires *intention*, and Breitbart themselves misleading advertisors about the content of their articles would really mess this one up. (Their op-ed articles, for instance, are a goldmine of nastiness, and advertisements show there too when they might have assumed it would be on news articles) 



Now, the ""Tortious interference"" ties into the fraud charge, in that the goal was to unfairly cause advertisors to cancel their contracts early or fail to perform. 


""Tortious interference of business.- When false claims and accusations are made against a business or an individual's reputation in order to drive business away."" 



Except here they *also* have to prove that the claims are false or misleading, and that they intended them to be false and misleading. 



With part of the project being to collect screen shots and evidence, I *highly* doubt Breitbart will able to claim it was false or misleading. It's like taking a picture of a chef spitting in the food and sending it to the customer. Only over and over again, building a mountain of evidence showing ""spitting in food"" is a regular occurance. 



They're not going to get very far with it, but I have a feeling that isnt the point. The point is to hurt Sleeping Giant with attorneys fees defending themselves. "

"It's got a lot to do with [the principal-agent problem.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem)

Basically what it means is that when a stronger nation offers support to a weaker one, the stronger nation is actually only doing so because it *needs something* from the weaker one--even if that need is merely survival. This ironically puts the weaker recipient in a position of power, because although it is the beneficiary and therefore relies on the stronger nation for support, it knows that it can leverage the requirements of the stronger nation against it. This is particularly problematic when the stronger nation doesn't really have many other options when it comes to having its interests protected (i.e. we don't exactly have our pick of powerful states in the Middle East who are willing to cooperate with us to secure our interests). It means that the weaker beneficiary can actually act with some impunity in terms of what it does so long as it continues to fulfill the primary goal of the stronger nation that is supporting it. Meaning Saudi Arabia knows it can get away with anti-humanitarian murder so long as it fulfills the U.S. need for a geopolitical ally against Iran.

Not that this can or should prevent us from protecting our citizens--we can certainly leverage our aid to demand that action be taken. But it does complicate things, such as preventing us from threatening to completely cut off all aid to Saudi Arabia (because like it or not, Kashogi and his children are not as big a priority for the United States as having a somewhat cooperative regional ally against Iran)."

"The Ward of Dawn gives an overshield ( Armor of Light) when in the bubble. According to some video testing I recently saw, the overshield is approximately 420 **extra** hit points in PvP. In addition, if the occupant of the bubble leaves the bubble and returns, *they get the full overshield back again.* Helm of Saint-14 mainly does the blind thing; its health/shield bump is only about 65 extra health/shield in PvP, but of course with the Armor of Light you are now looking at nearly an ***additional 600 HP***...and this is on top of your normal health and shields. I didn't see them test Spectral Blades vs the titan from inside, but it took 4 hits ( 3 with Raiden Flux) from an Arcstrider to kill the titan inside the bubble....and that was without the titan fighting back!"

"alonsojett -- I respect the fact that you put forth opinions that people might find easy to mock. Saying nice things about a popular, critically acclaimed film is easy and safe.

I also thought this film was under-appreciated and I really liked how it embraced how Speed Racer used to play in my head as a kid. I still remember taking Box Top cars and having them hit the sink at an angle, bounce up and the edge of the tires would grab the down-spout on the sink as it would smoothly transition to following the spout of water (as the wheels were moving so fast) so slide out onto the counter. Effortlessly bouncing into a salt shaker to knock a competitor's car off the cliff while Speed Racer would slip into the pack of racers to take home the prize (a PBJ sandwich of course).

In our heads -- there were no transitions with speed racer.

Sure, I could have made a comment that was rational and easy to follow -- but I was inspired to take a risk. I probably should re-write it without punctuation as an omage."

"In my opinion, the problem isn't so much that they don't listen, they just refuse to think outside their tiny tiny boxes.

People want harder difficulties? There are more options than just ""make fights harder"" vs. ""make fights easier."" Case in point, WoW has hard content. It also has moderate content, and easy content, and faceroll content, because it has 4 difficulty modes for dungeons. If FFXIV did something similar then they could please those people cheering in the crowd for harder dungeons without needing to go full Gordias/Midas on people. Personally, I quit FFXIV because I couldn't find a good difficulty niche. My static could do A5S but couldn't do A6S. Beating 1 boss every week and then smashing your head against a wall wasn't fun, so we burned out and I quit. With WoW it was super easy to find a good difficulty niche where I could still kill 6 to 11 bosses every week and actually feel like I was progressing.

You can listen to players all you want, but if you don't make any effort to innovate then you won't be able to come up with solutions to please everyone. 

WoW's basically the opposite. They're constantly doing new stuff, but they also throw out all their old stuff every expansion and re-invent the wheel.

On top of that, they don't listen to players when they say that the new stuff sucks, so we're stuck with it. "

I totally agree. I was just diagnosed a year ago at 39. Been writing a lot to make sense of my past through this new lense of bipolar disorder. It amazes me how obviously messed up I was. How the hell did I not know? How the hell did I survive this long without meds? And no wonder I've had such trouble maintaining relationships with friends and family. It's amazing to reflect on how much we've really survived. It is a constant struggle but in many ways it has made me stronger.

"Angron is an abused child.  His first moment of existence is pain.  His second is alien fucks trying to murder him and having to fight for his life.  His third is being enslaved and having his brain mutilated.  His fourth is having to fight and kill for the amusement of sick fucks.

Doesn't get much better from there, either.  He finds some friends, but his father shows up and kidnaps him.  Every person he is supposed to trust in his life betrays him.  He's too messed up to take control of his life.  He keeps trusting and keeps getting fucked over.  The worst is that he knows it, but deep down he's still just a little kid that wants someone to make it stop hurting."

"Why are you stuck on the idea it requires an SD card? Without even looking, I would bet that there are systems that can store on an external hard drive that could be kept somewhere like the glove compartment. This means the storage could be TBs rather than GBs

And even beyond that, there are dash cams that are connected via LTE and can store in the cloud constant video feeds for multiple weeks at a time.

But let's assume you have to use an SD card and other technologies don't exist. You still could get a week and a half of video recorded @ 720p on a 512 GB SD card, which someone may exaggerate as weeks. Hell even in this scenario, the person could offload the video once a week and skim through it all at the end of the month, or when they get bored at the timeframes their system said motion was detected.

I'm sure there are other possibilities I couldn't even think of.

My thoughts for team comps were something along the lines of:

Rota/Casandra/Ziricon/Mojo/water crow hag (or water SL) and just focusing those getting them to 5 stars and slowly building gear.

"I have some experience sort of related to this. You may find our GitHub repo useful. We ended copying and setting a script to run at the next reboot after preseed instead of staying in the preseed environment. We beat our heads in for a while before settling on this as a solution since we also had a lot of oddities in the preseed environment. We use a couple short shell scripts to set a hostname etc and then have Ansible take over from there. In your case you may be able to use our framework to get Ansible to run at the next boot or at the first login of a user instead just plain bash scripts like we have.

"I've never said his stats are bad, re read what I said.  My 2 main points are that 1) he is overly conservative (and thus his stats are inflated) and 2) he's mediocre to bad in lane.  These things are not mutually exclusive.  

You say that he has been the best preforming member for the entirety of his career.  I'm not sure if you mean this because he's played the longest and has had the largest overall contribution, but in no way has he been the best preforming C9 member for even an entire season, with players like Meteos, Hai, Jensen, and now Licorice. 

Saying he has been the Top 1 (this is actually rediculous) or 2 NA ADCs the entirety of his career (non-statistically) is also just glossing over every other ADC that has had good seasons/splits.  Yes, Sneaky has had his seasons where he is the 2nd best (or best statistically) but in no way has he been better than every other ADC not named Doublelift every single split.  

I'm not sure what DL preforming too scared on Kai'sa has anything to do with Sneaky losing DPS.  Sneaky strait up preformed better than DL this worlds.  I'm not blind.  DL played noticably worse than he did at MSI or last year's worlds.  And DL has made more mistakes at worlds.  It's because DL strives to play perfectly, meaning playing the knifes edge between DPS and not dying.  It is far more likely for him to make noticable mistakes if he isn't playing at peak than Sneaky.  "

Just tackling this block here, but yes to all the above. If short little comics [like this](https://imgur.com/a/WfJji) can portray a more serious side of a character, then a dedicated story can. I understand they have an outward image, but delving into the psyche of these monuments of history can quite easily turn a lot more dark and serious as long as that's the intent of the writing. They could have very easily replaced the Nobbu's in the latest GUDAGUDA with more soldiers and the like and it could have been quite a darker storyline in a whole.

The bottom line is, we don't know what the cost will be to taxpayers. However, Buffalo has made significant development to their downtown and it's thriving as a result. Projects like these are how you make a downtown relevant again. The more desirable the area is, the higher property values will be (good for tax payers), the more companies will want to stay or relocate. 

Good restaurants are already opening and thriving, a lot of the new residential is thriving despite the obscene rents they're asking. Between this and The Strong expansion¬π, I really believe this could be a hit if its done right with limited tax payer funding. But, build it and they will come isn't that far off. I know several people that traveled to Cleveland in the spring to see Hamilton. The theater apparently will host concerts and such, which would also draw people outside the Rochester economy.

1 - Have you seen the plans and the scope of The Strong expansion? That by itself is incredible. They apparently anticipate the proximity of people traveling to visit the expanded Stong would be 5-7 hours from here.

"This happened to me. I have generalized anxiety disorder and have had it my whole life. Most of the time I can cope quite well, but every now and then I have a panic attack. One night while my husband was traveling, I had a rather bad panic attack. I reached out to a new friend who I thought would be understanding. She shut me down and basically called me a big baby. Then she tried to drag religion into it (Christians don‚Äôt get anxiety because we are supposed to give our worries to God). I was so hurt and frustrated that it made my anxiety attack worse. I finally called my mom and she was able to talk to me.

"Ok, I  see where they're coming from with the [Waller v. Southern Gas](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2d/170/747.html) cite, but both those cases are pre-Daubert rulings.

Daubert II appears to bear on this directly:

&gt; First, however, we address plaintiffs' argument that we should simply  remand the case so the district court can make the initial **\[43 F.3d 1315\]**  determination of admissibility under the new standard announced by the  Supreme Court. There is certainly something to be said for this  position, as the district court is charged with making the initial  determination whether to admit evidence. In the peculiar circumstances  of this case, however, we have determined that the interests of justice  and judicial economy will best be served by deciding those issues that  are properly before us and, in the process, **offering guidance on the  application of the** ***Daubert*** **standard in this circuit.**   
&gt;  
&gt; The district court already made a determination as to admissibility,  albeit under a different standard than we apply on remand, and granted  summary judgment based on its exclusion of plaintiffs' expert testimony.  *Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,* [727 F.Supp. 570](https://www.leagle.com/cite/727%20F.Supp.%20570), 575-76 (S.D.Cal.1989). A grant of summary judgment may be sustained on any basis supported by the record, *Leonard v. Clark,* [12 F.3d 885](https://www.leagle.com/cite/12%20F.3d%20885),  889 (9th Cir.1993), so we shall consider whether the district court's  grant of summary judgment can be sustained under the new standard  announced by the Supreme Court. **Our review here is, of course, very  narrow: We will affirm the summary judgment only if, as a matter of law,  the proffered evidence would have to be excluded at trial. The district  court's power is far broader; were we to conclude that the expert  testimony is not per se inadmissible, the district court on remand would  nevertheless have discretion to reject it under Rule 403 or 702.** ***Daubert,*** **\_\_\_ U.S. at \_\_\_, 113 S.Ct. at 2798.** Such a ruling would be reviewed under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. 

It would seem the courts now do have the power to reject the admissibility of evidence in such an appeal?  Maybe it's a purely procedural argument, and the issue should be raised in a different motion?"

"The investors and developers are not exclusively developing luxury housing because it's the most profitable. It's because it's the only way to make a profit. Ultra restrictive zoning, excessively long wait times that reaches years before approval is given, and major uncertainty that the project will be approved even if it checks out all make it ridiculously expensive to build and luxury housing is the only way to recoup those costs. 

Those luxury buildings still contribute to supply, and furthermore, also keep the rich from going elsewhere and driving up rents. You know, gentrification. If you want more inclusive housing then let developers build more inclusive housing. Right now, only luxury housing is built because it's the only thing that can be built. Public housing isn't actually going to help. It's only going to concentrate poverty, not make it better. "

The energy of the sun was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale. All Earth turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.

" I've always understood a link to compare the relative energies or the two things linked. So, for example, you could use a block of ice to melt (well, sublimate) because the block of ice has more energy. But you couldn't use that block of ice to start a fire.

For heat to work conversions, i get that it gets tricky because everything has some energy that could be used to do work. In text, sympathy is related to a water wheel, which I think is a good example. Theoretically, even a slow river could eventually turn the wheel and get your work done. But practically, you need enough kinetic energy to do it on a productive timescale. My best guess would be sympathy works the same way: you could theoretically use the thermal energy in a cold rock or a block of ice to move a water wheel, but because those things are in less excited states that energy is much less readily available and it would not occur over a reasonable time span (especially because you lose some percentage of the excess energy to slippage). 

As for why air isn't used, you have to think about it in terms of energy, not heat. Different materials require different amounts of energy change to raise or lower their temperature by one degree. The term for this is specific heat. Water has a specific heat of 4200 Jkg-1K-1 and Air has one of 993 Jkg-1K-1. Simplifying this, that means it takes a little more than 4 times as much energy to raise a kilogram of water by one degree Kelvin than it does to raise one kilogram of air by the same amount. But water is also more dense than air. The exact amount more dense varies based on environmental conditions, but 750x more dense is a reasonable value and it makes our math easier, so lets use that. This means that one mL of water requires about 3000x more energy to drop a degree than a mL of air. Yes, air is more readily available, but it would require linking a great deal of air to get the same effect as water, which would in turn reduce your efficiency, and I think you get the point."

"A few things about the ferry:

1. The crossing to Craignure from Oban is pretty sheltered. On a bad day you‚Äôll get a fair bit of motion, but it‚Äôs far from the worst. Your main issue is the wind, which might prevent the ship getting alongside, but it‚Äôs not hugely common for the ferry to be cancelled all day.

2. There‚Äôs a high risk that your car will get ‚Äòdinged‚Äô by someone else‚Äôs car door. The car deck is very tightly packed, usually a foot or so between each lane, inches between bumpers."

"No, but I'm fluent and have a lot of practice speaking to Filipinos. My accent is not perfect for sure. You know you're getting close when natives stop asking how you know Tagalog and telling you how good it is. Eventually they'll stop enunciating and just start talking to you like everyone else, and that's very satisfying.

My advice is to practice speaking sentences often. Learn a word from the dictionary, sure, but then try to practice pronouncing it in a sentence. You get weird things going on (both in grammar and pronunciation) if you learn words and then try to string them together, and I still have weird halts when I speak because I over-focused on picking words out instead of trying to imitate whole sentences."

Also, how bad women are today is not simply cause they‚Äôre women; radical feminism has brainwashed women and the government has given then a loaded gun in marriage. They have been shaped by a degenerate society and so are more degenerate than ever. Were they like they are today in the 20s, 30s, 40s, etc? No they were not. It‚Äôs not just their nature; it‚Äôs society and government. Were many men Nazis in Germany because they were men? Of course not. They were that way because they allowed a lunatic and an evil ideology to screw them up. It‚Äôs not much different with women. Their ideology is feminism. "

"What is is with Bryan, I think, isn't that he hates everything so much as the fact he will go ballistic on anything negative. If a show is has a 70/30 good-to-bad ratio, it seems like the time he spends talking about the 70% good is considerably less than the 30% bad that he'll fly off the handles for.
With few exceptions, you could pretty much take a show from any major company (As far as American companies go) at any time in the past 30 years, and the majority of his review of it will be this big huge long rant about how bad such and such was, even if such and such was a small part of the show. To his credit, though, I have heard he likes old school Southern Wrasslin', but I've also never really had any desire to hunt down a review of like 1980s Georgia Championship Wrestling or something to confirm that.

I won't call myself a regular listener to his stuff, but I've heard enough full shows to say that I have a reasonable sample of his stuff and it seems like he's always moaning about something, no matter how good anything else is. And I get that it's his schitck and he's probably hamming it up for the entertainment factor, but it can still get really grating."

"For the specific state she's in I don't know. From the short call I had with her she seems to be sticking pretty heavily to a series of delusions including thinking that I'm married, that she needs a new first name, that the reason she feels bad is because of the waves and a couple of other things. 

The trigger that set her off is a confrontation between my grandpa and her due to my aunt being raped a long time ago in college and not telling my grandparents. From what I can gather she was hit pretty hard with that and then went further down when she gave that info to my grandfather.

She's been on meds, specifically what I don't know, since I was 3 or 4. Recently she's been getting a lower dose as she seemed to be doing fine and she was looking to lessen the side effects. I think this in combination with the confrontation is what set everything off.

She has a family doctor she visits and a talk therapist but I don't know either of them since the general theme in my family is keep what's personal to yourself."

It is completely beliveable that the shock from such an event like the realistation that there were so many people that would vote for Trump or the fear of the drastic changes that may occur to your life as a consequence of said election, could cause PTSD."

"This game actually has this awesome feature where if you hit RB/R1, it basically does a cinematic guard impact. There's normal guard impacts too for a faster/more advantageous counter. Otherwise (Xbox controls) A is block, X is horizontal atk, Y is vertical atk, and B is kick. Each character feels very unique but nearly all play with those clear-cut controls. For a novice, I think it'd be just about as simple as Smash to pick up. It might be deeper, but you'd absolutely be able to enjoy it. Plus the character creator is a whole separate thing to enjoy. The only issue is that the game sucks time out of your day like a vacuum lol. You can easily make a character in 10-20 minutes. Then spend 2 hours perfecting another by perfectly placing each pattern, sticker, scar, dirt, etc. Arcade takes about 12-15 minutes to play through and there's a story mode with the main characters. Then there's a separate game mode you can do where you buy gear and stuff with a created character and do your own story like a light RPG. So much to just sink time into. Lots of content for a fighting game. One of my favorite game franchises and this is definitely my favorite since SC 2. Without a doubt."

Plus it will help the band earn some money and hopefully have enough to do a budget tour in russia where she is at.

"I once read that every time you give into a compulsion it gets stronger so I set about trying to ignore them.  It was hellishly hard at first but the more I failed to carry a compulsive act out the fewer compulsions I had.

Problem came when I was stressed and would follow my compulsions without thinking.  Before I knew it I was lining shit up, clicking off lights, checking to see if stuff was plugged in, avoiding odd numbers and many other silly things my brain felt it would be fun to force on me.

I first noticed I had a problem at about age 12 about the time I went through puberty.  I knew my compulsions to line up art supplies etc weren't normal.  I have a brother 20 years older and he was home visiting and he is the only person in my family to notice.  He just jokingly asked me why I was doing all the little odd things.  I told him I knew it wasn't normal but couldn't stop.  He told me what OCD was and I wasn't crazy which helped.

I'm over 50 &amp; the amount of time I've spent following compulsions if tabulated, would be staggering.  It's who I am.  I try to be aware of when it's getting bad and force myself to do the opposite until I get it under control.  I'd say hardly a days goes by that I don't feel compelled to touch something or avoid certain numbers or whatever.  Compared to my teenage years it's quite under control.

For the funniest personal account of OCD read David Sedaris book Naked.  It is one of funniest things I've ever read.

"&gt; Ima be real with you i dont understand how specifically talking about cowys2 changes anything i said. 

Because you‚Äôre acting like when you make a broad statement about music after peeps death cowys 2 isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre talking about at all 

&gt; Like whats different about cowys2 than any other music that will eventually be released by him? 

Nothing, but you were talking about music after his passing what it was like before being released (cowys 2 fits that) and I was confused why‚Äôd you want someone to leak the unmixed version of it

&gt; This last part didnt even need to be included.  

I was just including my own personal feelings in my comment like you were yours. I never said you disagreed with that but I was just being more specific , it was just as needed as your comment 

&gt; And i actually prefer it. 

Never said you didn‚Äôt. Just don‚Äôt understand why you hope someone leaks the unmixed version of cowys 2 

&gt; that‚Äôs why youre being downvoted. 

Huh? You didn‚Äôt give any explanation as to why lol but I already know why, you‚Äôre mad at yourself because you didn‚Äôt type what you meant. So far you‚Äôve just stated irrelevant things I‚Äôve never questioned. Don‚Äôt be so weak minded tho where someone asks why you said something and because it‚Äôs not what you meant to say you downvote  lol that‚Äôs pathetic. 

&gt; Youre being sassy 

That‚Äôs ironic. I was being polite asking a simple question and right away sense you said something you didn‚Äôt mean to you be an ass to me on some weak minded shit it was pathetic dude. 

&gt; Its actually depressing i had to explain a comment to you

You should be happy to read this comment then where I explain how everything you just said was irrelevant and I never questioned. You said you want someone to leak what the music was before his passing. So I asked why would you want to hear cowys 2 like that. It‚Äôs that simple, and some how you‚Äôre so stupid you got completely off track typing me a book about something I never asked about. Your comprehension skills are trash dude. Look how off topic you got because I took what you said literally when apparently you meant specific things you just never named. 

&gt; Next time just think before replying to comments itll save you a lot of embarrassment.

Agreed. Completely
Alright I will and thank you
"How many skills will you use?  Fate Core has quite a few skills but I find that most settings only need about a dozen of them (lumping some skills together.)  The default skill list has 18 skills, so a character with a +4 pyramid would be proficient in roughly half of those.  If you're slimming down to a dozen or so skills, you can lower the pyramid to +3 and still have people proficient in half the skills.

I personally would much prefer a lower starting point with more frequent Significant Milestones to some sort of ""progressive scale adjustment"" that makes the opposition worse.  It's far more satisfying to look at your character sheet and see a +6 than it is to realize that orcs are now reduced to Fight +0 instead of the +2 they had when you were still a noob."

"Hey, thanks for the reply... so I actually finally got it going, maybe I shoulda updated, bigtweekX gave me a solution that worked. They're awesome for that.

Here's a quick guide, not necessarily for the guy replying to me, but for anyone who wants to do the same: 

‚Ä¢ Undo any current root solution like SuperSU. Within superSU app's settings there's a button at the bottom for ""full unroot"" or whatever, do that. When unrooting there's two questions... one is about restoring the stock boot image (yes, do this, it's necessary) and another is about restoring the stock recovery interface (no, avoid this, you want TWRP as your recovery interface)

Note: the stock boot.img is not the same as stock rom, if anyone is noob like me and wondering. Restoring it doesn't wipe out your files and settings or whatever. It's like... something that controls how the phone boots and what permissions you have I guess? If you install root, it tends to get modified, but to install magisk, it needs to be UNmodified. And fortunately, when installing superSU, the original stock boot.img is backed up, and can be recovered when you do the unroot.

I'm not sure if it's possible to have a stock boot.img on a not-stock ROM. I was on stock rom already.

‚Ä¢ Do make sure you got TWRP installed.

‚Ä¢ Install magisk, which is a slightly confusing process. There are basically two main steps. And even now, I'm not sure if it matters what order you do them in. 

The steps are, you gotta install magisk manager (APK file with low version number like 6.0.1) and you gotta install a ZIP.  If you do the manager first and run it, it will tell you if the other step is done, which is the important one, the ZIP. It will also offer to download the zip for you.

I didn't get the zip this way, I got it via the same page as I got the manager - https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445

The zip version will be 17.1, 17.2, something like that.

So this guide says do APK, then zip: https://android.gadgethacks.com/how-to/magisk-101-install-magisk-root-with-twrp-0179668/  
And this other one says do ZIP, then APK: https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-magisk/

The zip is the part that might be a little scary if someone is new to this stuff. Or it was for me anyway, because I had the idea that ""flashing"" things is like overwriting the stock rom. But you can install certain flashable ZIP files without changing the rom or doing anything crazy to your phone. It's just a way of installing something, which has to happen outside of the normal android operating system, before the OS is loaded. 

So reboot into TWRP, aka recovery mode:  
power off, press and hold home, press and hold volume up, press and hold power... wait a few seconds until you see the boot screen appear, then you can let go of everything. You should see ""recovery bit loading"" at the top left or something.

Go to ""install"" from the TWRP main screen. Navigate to the magisk 17.1 (or whatever) zip file you downloaded. Do the thing that says swipe right to install.  I don't know if it matters where you save this zip but I kept it in external sd card / downloads /

If it works, you see some text showing the install steps, and if you see an error here, it will probably be the ""install stock boot.img"" error, which means you didn't do the unroot step I mentioned earlier. I dunno how to fix that except for doing the SuperSU unroot method. Maybe it's harder for other root solutions. 

If install goes smoothly it may suggest wiping dalvik/cache, which maybe you should do even if it doesn't suggest it, and there happens to be a big button at the bottom left to do that. Then a big button at the bottom right to reboot.

‚Ä¢ After rebooting, WAIT. When you first reboot after this, it may seem like the phone is frozen. It did to me. Actually I DID freeze my phone at one point... on the intitial black samsung galaxy s5 screen. But if you get past that screen and see the sprint spark animation, you're good to go. Just wait. It takes a while. Let's say give it at least 10 minutes.  You should eventually see a teal screen saying something like ""android is updating settings"" and then you know you're ok. You might have seen a similar screen after upgrading from 4.x to android 6.0. 

If the phone is ACTUALLY frozen, don't panic, you can fix this problem (and similar problems) by rebooting into twrp, and flashing a correct ZIP file that basically undoes the bad thing you did to hang your phone. That uninstaller ZIP is here: https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445 and this guy's site has lots of good info on dealing with magisk install/uninstall problems: https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk/MagiskUninstallIssues

‚Ä¢ If you get magisk ZIP installed ok, and the manager, you can run the manager (dismiss the popup asking if you want to download a new zip) and it will either show red text if magisk failed to install, or green text saying it installed ok. You can optionally do a ""safetynet check"". Safetynet is some android security thing they added a while after the S5 was released, and is part of android 6 if you updated to Marshmallow. If a phone is rooted or has a custom rom or whatever, it might fail the safetynet check, and some android stuff will NOT work on a phone that fails this test. For example samsung wallet and (I think someone said) snapchat. So passing the test is good. It's possible to root the phone and pass the test, and that's kind of why magisk is nice, it's a ""systemless"" root solution which means it doesn't mess up your phone's system partition, which is what safetynet is checking for. 

Passing it is good but I don't think it's the end of the world if you fail. In fact, I think installing Xposed will fail it, even if you have ""systemless"" xposed. It just means a handful of specific apps may refuse to work. Nothing I use regularly was affected tho.

‚Ä¢ After magisk is installed, you need Xposed separately, and this is where I managed to hang my phone. The xposed installer is similar to the magisk zip installer... there's an APK, and then there's flashable ZIP file. 

But it's crucial you pick the CORRECT zip. The correct zip for samsung users on galaxy S5 is a bit different from the zips some other newer phones can use. If you try one of those zips, your phone will hang/bootloop, and then you gotta flash some special uninstall zip to fix the problem.

They have separate magisk installs based on your version. This guide is for galaxy S5, that's version 6 if you fully update Android, aka marshmallow, aka ""SDK 23"". It runs on ARM architecture... it's not important but I mention it because, if you're confused about what file to get at any point, you know for sure it should NOT be a file that says ""arm64"" or ""x86""...if it says anything about ""arm"" it would say ""armeabi"". 

The systemless xposed installer page is here: https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/unofficial-systemless-xposed-t3388268

And you can see some red text about how people with our phone should NOT get the latest version (89.3, 90) but instead should get 87.3.

I think where I fucked up is, the page above links to older, alternate versions by someone called wanam. I'd read that those versions are what I want. But if you go to that [link](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/unofficial-xposed-samsung-lollipop-t3180960), you will be led to a [download page](https://androidfilehost.com/?w=files&amp;flid=37508) that only offers xposed up to version 87.1.

You want 87.3, or at least, that's the version that 100% works for me. The file I used was called ""xposed-v87.3-sdk23-topjohnwu.zip"" and the file came from the end of the first post on this page: https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/unofficial-systemless-xposed-t3388268

‚Ä¢ Do these steps. http://www.droidbro.com/install-systemless-xposed-framework-on-magisk-root/

You want to install the APK file linked at the top of that guide first, but DON'T run it after installing.

Then, reboot, go into TWRP, click install, and install that carefully chosen ZIP file: xposed-v87.3-sdk23-topjohnwu.zip

Note that if that fails, the ""I fucked up please fix it"" zip file can be downloaded here: https://dl-xda.xposed.info/framework/uninstaller/
And the one you would want for Galaxy S5 is called this: ""xposed-uninstaller-20180117-arm.zip""

However when I got my boot hanging issue, using this uninstaller didn't seem to work, I had to uninstall magisk too, and then I could boot normally. Then I started again from scratch, making sure to choose the correct installer files the second time.

Another way to install xposed is this... try it if the above doesn't work: run magisk manager... click the search button. Search for xposed... it should bring up xposed framework installers. Look for 87.3 (sdk23) and install that one. Somehow magisk manager can do it without rebooting the phone. 

If it works, you can now run xposed framework (that APK you installed in the previous step, but avoided running)... it should be in your phone's list of apps. If you run it, it should confirm xposed framework is installed correctly, and that you have root (through magisk). 

Incidentally, throughout all these steps, you may be asked to grant root permission to do some of the tasks. Say yes. 

‚Ä¢ If xposed installs correctly, all that's left is to get some modules, which are like individual apps that will only install/work if xposed is installed ahead of time. Note, something that's a little confusing: Magisk has modules too. And xposed is sometimes referred to as a module for magisk. In any case, if you got magisk and xposed installed correctly, you can now install various modules for BOTH, and they should work.

"I believe in God because I think his existence is the best explanation for the universe that we observe.  We've been able to determine that the universe has a starting point and time in which all matter and all the laws of physics we're defined.  (The big bang). The laws of physics appear to be defined with extreme precision to allow this universe to exist, for heavier elements to be created in supernova, and to avoid various dead/collapsing universe scenarios.  Basically if the universe were just a tiny bit different, it wouldn't work right and an Earth like scenario would be completely impossible.   Which scenario so I think is more likely?  (a) there was nothing, and nothing created the universe that just happens to be amazingly balanced (b) something/someone created the universe providing it with those amazingly balanced properties.   We don't really know, and it takes some amount of 'belief/faith' to decide on one answer or three other.  From my perspective the universe appears designed.  Einstein said ‚Äúscience without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.‚Äù. I feel that the more I learn about the universe, the more it appears designed.   There are many other areas of scientific study that imo support the existence of God.  We each have to consider the evidence science provided and interpret what we see with as little bias as possible, then make our own conclusions.  "

"There‚Äôs no way to know for sure. I have seen proper UFOs but on pictures they are virtually impossible to tell apart from other random lights.

This could be a flare but I don‚Äôt know if lack of glow is characteristic of flares, I actually believe flares have glows (I have a pic of a rainbow swatch that has a flare and it has a huge light around it). 

The reason it‚Äôs interesting to me is that I observed a two foot light trans-dimensional object in my completely dark room once and it never lit the room up, it looked bright enough to serve as a pretty decent lamp but the room remained dark. So to me lack of glow could be indicative of ETs. But I don‚Äôt think we can conclude in a concrete manner here. üññüèº

It's unrealistic but retelling the same story will be boring. Were these 2 NPCs just pieces that are part of a larger story? Maybe they come back to life but pretend to stay dead. They can then show up later in the campaign as a surprise.

I was so caught up in keeping the flow of the game I forgot to tell them, so just bringing them back would probably be a dick move. Also yes, killing them was a piece of a larger scheme, I'm thinking I'll bring one of them back up later, but not the other."

"Of all my big bad-ass bad guys, I gotta say my favorite comes down to a couple of nobodies. Not even villains, but clearly the opposition/antagonist in the given situations. Both are from 7th Sea...

The first is a Montaigne, skulking the Avalon countryside. He's pretending to be Sidhe because the Avalons are all stupid and superstitious so the fall for the ruse easily. Until the PCs show up that is. When pressed he decides that it's time to cut his losses and run, only to run into an actual Sidhe Lord who had come looking for the imposter. And thus began the real challenge of having to deal with an angry Sidhe Lord.

The other was a wronged lover. He had been denied the hand in marriage of his lady love by her father, an Admiral in the Avalon navy. In truth, all the young man wanted was the group to distract the father while and his love fled the country. Okay, maybe the PCs could ""stab him up, just a little bit."" But that was it! Nothing lethal or permanently scarring. The challenge is issued, the PC manages to easily thump the old fart and True Love wins! The only problem is, the Admiral's daughter had fled to the mainland decades ago, to be with her true love. And alas, the ship went down en route. The Admiral was a bitter old man who realized far too many things, far too late. The young lover? A thief. He'd heard the Admiral lamenting his life over drinks with friends, about how he'd acquired a great many interesting treasures over his life and he'd gladly trade them all for one more moment with his daughter so he could try to make things right.

The PCs were not happy about being duped and hunted the bastard down across three countries, dragged him back, and had him imprisoned in Avalon to await justice."

"I bought a Dr Pen A6 model, and a few packs of the 12 pin disposable needles, was about $100 for both on eBay. I wanted to make sure the pen was one that actually reciprocated, rather than a knockoff that vibrates. The A6 has delivered so far.

  
I also use tattoo numbing cream, applied about an hour before hand. You can get stuff from the chemist like EMLA, but it's only about 5% strength. Again if you look on eBay, you can get 40% stuff (called TKTX). 10 x 10g tubes was about $20 and I use about a full tube each time. This numbing cream also comes in hand for electrolysis.

&amp;#x200B;

About the forehead lines, I have them too. I've used the pen on them once, but I wasn't sure what depth to go. I'll definitely be trying to reduce them further in the future, the pen should be able to do it. My friend has also been using it on his acne scars, and in patchy parts of his beard.

The minoxidil I use is Kirkland brand, was way cheaper than the Rogain brand, and they're basically the same. 3 months supply was about $30, can probably find it cheaper if you look around. No prescription needed, I just went with the 5% streangth. The RU58841 is actually an experimental chemical, I found out about it on other hairloss forums. Not sure if it's necessary or not, but I figured I'd throw everything I can at my hair. I get it as a powder from online, then mix it into the minoxidil bottles as I go.

"I'm doing it right now, at 2km or so, the drop is sufficient.

Assume target is at 2 kilometers and you fire at ~1.1 degrees to hit it, the projectile leaves your top tube height of 2.67 meters. It reaches the maximum height of 11.87 meters. That gives you a possible drop of 9.2 meters back to tube height (lets assume top of enemy tank).

A very shallow angle indeed (0.3 degrees) - but still some drop. If they're sniping and only exposing a -little- of themselves, and you can fire from the top of your tube (starts at bottom..) then in theory you can NLOS an enemy vehicle. In theory. In practice, I'm getting about 1-2 kills every few games with no or limited line of sight. With VERY SLIGHT margins. Majority of the time I'm missing at less than 2KM if its no line of sight.

&gt; **‚ÄúIt was a pro-enforcement bill that Clinton signed and many Democrats agreed with,‚Äù** Kobach said.

&gt; **Later in the 2000s, though, Democrats changed their position on immigration enforcement and instead took a hardline pro-amnesty stance that focused on allowing the millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S. to permanently stay in the country.**

&gt; **‚ÄúMaybe they could stomach some enforcement of immigration, but they were cheering the illegal aliens already here,‚Äù** Kobach said.

&gt; **‚ÄúNow we have a new phase of the open borders psychosis which is the left cheering illegal aliens outside of the country to come in,‚Äù Kobach said. ‚ÄúWhich is a huge process past advocating for amnesty for illegal aliens already in the country.‚Äù**

"If crunch is going to stop you from playing this game then quit everything except completely indie gaming and like, modern Valve games. Crunch exists everywhere else to some degree.

All you (not just you, but anyone thinking this way who is interested in the game) not spending your money can accomplish is get people less bonus pay or laid off - making their crunch time worth less and forcing them to another company that might have less benefits (Rockstar is fairly big after all) but just as more crunch. 

If the game (somehow, it won't, just hypothetically) does poorly the higher ups are not going to leap to ""well maybe it is because of our crunch practices"" because that sure hasn't stopped anybody else (including GTA5).

Crunch is a problem that is solved by people in the industry unionizing/performing legal action pretty much. That's not going to happen overnight, or maybe not even a year or two, but it's on the people in the industry to fix it. 

The people who sat through that crunch, more than anything they're still hoping the hours they poured into the product being away from their friends and family don't go to waste and bring people entertainment &amp; happiness, because at the end of the day that's why they do this job.

"&gt;It is a crime against God that Christians vote for laws against abortion when there are

First off, you don't have to be Christian to be pro-life.

Second, plenty of self-identified ""Christians"" are pro-abortion. See Hillary Clinton, among others.

Third, plenty Christians do in fact look after foster kids, or place children in adoption homes, when maniacs aren't trying to get them shut down for not wanting to place kids with couples who think pride parades are a good idea.

Fourth, plenty of Christians are in no state to look after any foster kids. We have our own families, we have our own struggles, some of us just aren't cut out for parenthood.

But most of all: I don't need to dance to your stupid tune and get your approval to oppose abortion. Stop getting knocked up/knocking people up in the stupidest and most selfish possible ways, and that will cut down not only on the number of abortions, but the number of abandoned kids too.

We are not your freaking mop-up squad for your life's many mistakes and bad choices. If you think foster care is so rotten, how about you go out there and encourage women and men to not make stupid choices, and don't treat murder as a solution to said stupid choices."

"Yeah, I save but it still can get frustrating.

I'm early to mid game in this playthrough (Nightmare) and am running an almost full assassin build, so in the protect quests which instantly begin with enemies alerted I'm already at a disadvantage.

To beat harder enemies I generally have to either whittle them down with poison while kiting and dodging, or break line of sight, hide in a brush and abuse stealth attacks while they try to find me (sometimes a combination of the two).

The aggravating thing about protect quests is that while I'm doing my kiting, hiding and other tricky things in order to prevail over enemies who are often much stronger in direct combat than I, the protect target runs into the melee and rips threat with a single punch, getting immediately killed unless I can sprint over and reestablish aggro before that happens, which obviously ruins the entire strategy.

I finally gave up on that mission after like seven or eight tries. Too annoying until I have more points in warrior."
From the way this is worded I feel that just her having a discreet talk to the prof should be able to resolve this. If it doesn't is when you go to the dept head.

"I‚Äôm glad too! I heard he was fired. Probably because he‚Äôs been posting all this crazy stuff. I guess he‚Äôs worrying them to death too. I don‚Äôt believe for a minute he quit. He‚Äôs such a liar.

It‚Äôs like he can‚Äôt resist posting on social media. As far as I know he has no job. Karine is supposed to have her visa interview on the 30th and be here for the holidays. He probably thinks a job would get in the way of her coming.

I know! He said his account is private, but I‚Äôm still on it. Maybe I‚Äôm grandfathered in lol I saw that picture of David at the dog pen. Wonder how Pole got him to come over. He doesn‚Äôt deserve dogs. No doubt mother is paying for all of it.

I am so creeped out about this fetus in the fridge.  Do people do this? It‚Äôs like Rachel mailing an umbilical cord to Jon but way way worse. He said they can‚Äôt afford to bury it. I guess a go fund me is in their future. 

I don‚Äôt doubt he‚Äôs doing all of the pictures and social media stuff. For whatever reasons he seems scared to let her get on there. He probably doesn‚Äôt want her to see how awful people think he is. Not like she doesn‚Äôt already know some of it. 

I wish someone would open her eyes too. Life` at the Bates motel will not be fun. Her family will be too far away to help her. She‚Äôd have to depend on him to give her a ticket back to Brazil if she wanted to leave and I doubt he would. 

I hope she flunks her visa interview too. I know know what kind of visa she‚Äôs getting. I‚Äôll bet father didn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt sponsor her either.  Karine isn‚Äôt going to like it here and mother will most definitely try to control her. I can see mother and Pole ganging up on her. It‚Äôs not going to end well.

Pole is on another planet. He‚Äôs going to keep filming their lives on IG without the show. Does he really expect people to watch this much less pay for it? He‚Äôs nuts! I guess mother will be the camera person. What a freak!!

"I basically exclusively play Voidwalker, have since day 1 in D1. It's a bit stronger than reasonable in PvP but in PvE it's pretty much perfectly balanced. Excels at add clear, does okay boss DPS, and allows you to do both at the same time in some fights with good positioning, while allowing you to self-sustain with good ability usage.

The super needs some slight toning down for PvP's sake, but tweaks should be done carefully. Nerf it too much to cater to PvP and then it's risking being useless in PvE.

I would suggest upping charged blasts' damage(at least in PvE) and reducing overall super duration slightly. Whatever cuts out a couple seconds while enabling the same total amount of PvE damage."

"&gt;yellowface was a thing too.

And yellowface is wrong, too.

&gt;Blackface hasn't been a thing for decades now, either. Unlike swastikas, which are still used today.

[It took me less than 30 seconds to find this example of blackface.](https://i.imgur.com/a1TA6MF.jpg)

[It took me another 30 seconds to find this second example.](https://i.imgur.com/a1TA6MF.jpg)

Both of those are from 2008 or later. If you want to stretch credulity to its breaking point, you could *maybe* go back to 2004 when Obama first gained national attention for giving the keynote speech at the Democratic national convention. So yes, blackface is still used today.

&gt;Which is why it makes no sense to have a problem with this unless it's actually offensive. If someone isn't perpetuating stereotypes and isn't doing it in a racist manner, why do you care?

Two things:

The only person who has a say in whether something is offensive is the person that is actually offended. You can debate whether an offensive act has intrinsic worth that outweighs the harm caused by the offense, but you cannot wholly disregard the offense someone else takes.

And second, as I've literally just shown, it matters because blackface is *still* used in a racist manner to this day. You could _maybe_ get waaay down into the weeds and debate whether _this_ instance of blackface was offensive, or whether _this_ frat boy doing a T'Challa cosplay was innocent fun. But that's asking people to have a really difficult debate, and for what? 

Seriously, what is the benefit of having that kind of debate? All it accomplishes at *best* is that white folks can put on brown makeup and do a cosplay of black characters without getting yelled at--even though you've already admitted that there's thousands of other possible costumes and cosplays they could do instead. At worst, it's giving racists and other bad faith actors a way to push racist views with plausible deniability.  

There's so many difficult conversations we need to have as a society regarding so many different things, that matter so much more than letting some white college kid put on brown makeup."

"Eh, click the 20 year tab!

Chavez took office in Feb 1999, when oil was $19 dollars a barrel. It rose year on year for the next 9 years, directly under his governance. He was gifted a massive economic injection from the booming price of oil. This was a huge, free (oil price rise that has never been relinquished) boost to public finances that coincided directly with his ascension to power and which he used (alongside large levels of public borrowing) to pay for inordinate amounts of populist social programs that were used to deceive people into believing and supporting the ""wonders of socialism"".

Between Aug 2005 and Aug 2007, the price stabilised at an average of $90 per barrel. There was a small bubble between Aug 07 and Aug 08 where the price skyrocketed to $160 a barrel. Between Aug 08 and 09 this bubble was corrected with the price falling to back to the previous long term stable price ($82 in Aug 09). Between Aug 09 and Aug 2014, the price stabilised in the long term again and actually rose to around an average of $100 per barrel over the 5 years. So you had 9 years of an almost entirely stable oil price where the Venezuelan economy still went to shit - runaway inflation beginning in Aug 2012 (inflation was already high in 2010 when Venezuela was the only country in SA in recession), food shortages caused by import reliance due to socialist agricultural policy (where have we heard that one before....), . Not because of an oil price but because a huge social expenditure beyond what the country could afford, which then crushed the countries ability to borrow on international markets when any crisis came knocking.

SO THIS WAS ONE YEAR. ONE YEAR IN A 20 YEAR EXPERIMENT WITH SOCIALISM. And in fact, the price only fell below the long term average for around 8 months. The Venezuelan economy did not start to disintegrate because of one solitary year where the oil price went out of whack. In fact, I would hazard a guess that government expenditure probably barely even changed for that fiscal period.

Also your analysis of the 2014 crisis is weak. Not only was the country's economy failing long before then but oil production has fallen by 50% as well. This not due solely to the price but to under investment, supply chain issues from lack of foreign currency reserves (depleted by having to import food that could easily be produced in Venezuela lest socialist policy), brain drain (not point in the highly educated living in a country where some people can't buy diapers,rummage in garbage bags so not to starve and have to wash their teeth in coca cola because it's the only bottled liquid you can buy). Venezuela could easily have upped oil production to cover missing public coffers - if the country had had any semblance of economic health/normality.

Venezuela's decline has certainly accelerated since 2014 but it was of a terminal nature long before then.

"I one tricked Olaf jg after the mid season shenanigans, I mean patches, found an early game pathing that worked really well. Focused primarily on Neutral objective control, enemy jg tracking, and counter jungling. I counterganked only if necessary. 

Usually took first drake early (around 5-6 minute mark) when enemy jg show top. Then rotate to top side control for herald. Once herald secured, immediately took to mid or top lane to secure first turret, when possible. I found using herald right away was more successful then saving it. If I waited the enemy would group to contest the lane and stop the herald. 

Usually stay focused on rotations after first turret with team mates to stay snowballed and a head of enemy. When team followed my objective calls we usually cleaned up pretty easily and choked out the enemy to close. "

"Because there is absolutely no evidence that this accomplishes its goals. Ironically, the biggest challenge in this space is that it's not hard to come up with a solution that 90% works... people come up with all kinds of schemes and new projects to scale the blockchain (Ethereum or otherwise) that solve 90% of the problem. The challenge is that the remaining 10% of the time when it doesn't work causes the entire system to collapse and makes the entire project useless.

There's no evidence that this is the one true project that solves this problem and as I said... finding people who are working on this problem or have a partial solution is a dime a dozen. Most of them are in academia and tackling this at an academic research level, so they don't have any token to sell or put any effort to market themselves other than perhaps at research conferences. Why we should believe that this one works when all the other ones don't is a burden that OpenST needs to prove.

The fact that this project happened to get up voted very highly and the other ones didn't is not a good enough reason to give this project anymore attention. As other commenters have pointed out, it's likely that most of the upvotes for this submission and the top comment by /u/BackgroundResult are bots."

"A public plan would offer so much more stability and ‚Äústatistical risk‚Äù over just high risk pools or standard insurance pools. All members of the pool would have the same standardized tiered plans. These coverages and limits are the hard part for public, private or socialized health insurance. The proverbial ‚Äúdeath squads‚Äù. You limit coverages to what makes the most economical sense and tier it from there. 

Having a limited profit margin with cost + aggregate billing would balance ‚Äúmoral‚Äù contribution and realized unexpected costs. All that could be negotiated into insurance bidding. When we get to the magnitude of 100 of millions over ‚Äú25k‚Äù the difference is drastic for multiple reasons, leverage being one of the largest you left out. 

All these people bitching about socialized healthcare can put their money where their mouth is. Every leftist, socialist, government official, child, and many on public assisted insurance could be migrated to this public plan. Anyone who was not part of the plan has absolutely no reason to call for socialized health care. 

It‚Äôs the private market‚Äôs response to it if the proles were smart enough to unionize. The leverage allows you to better cover the sick, lower insurance profit, and dictate base health care. "

"&gt;I remember I was trying to cut one time and I was eating super clean, but a ton of food. Even calories from a chicken breast count at the end of the day. I finally figured it out, it‚Äôs a zero sum equation, if you‚Äôre burning food calories, you‚Äôre not burning fat calories.

The point is that clean calories should fill you sufficiently to be neutral or net loss. A fucking pound of chicken breast is \~750 calories. If an adult male is substantially physically active, it's really hard to eat clean and not burn fat. Spinach is 105 calories / pound.

 

Someone can eat pounds upon pounds of clean food per day and still have very modest calorie counts."

"Not walking them on a collar I believe is also because their trachea's are sensitive to pressure and easily collapsed. It's not unique to Pugs, Chihuahua's have that too, and they're one of the longest-lived/healthiest breeds around.

In general most collars aren't great for walking, especially if the dog pulls. If you need control a gentle-leader is more effective (though they combine well with a martingale or prong for training), and a harness (front clip) for those that need minor correction or pull too much. If they're a loose-lead walker, most anything goes."

"&gt; This is a truly disgusting line of thought that I have run into when debating atheists. The idea that teaching kids any 'hard stances' other than secularism and Enlightenment ideals, IE, anything that contradicts their personal beliefs, is grounds for literal child abuse. Naturally, this not only violates the First Amendment's Freedom of Religion clause, but, if these lunatics that thought this ever managed to consolidate power, it's not really a great leap of logic to say that they would enact laws that would treat it as actual child abuse would be, either completely outlawing the practice, or even go as far as to have CPS take kids away from the parents that do (Which is a practice that's already been put into effect in extremely atheistic countries like Denmark). 

*Some* atheists. I don't hold that stance and I don't think many of us here do. I mean, I was raised religious and practically everyone I know was raised religious, so I think it's pretty ridiculous to say that we were all abused. I don't think I have been. I've had a pretty great childhood. 

That said, there are some teachings that I think harm kids. I'm not sure I'd call them abusive, but things like hell leave a lasting and painful effect. I had nightmares over that and still do, despite not believing in God‚Äî that's how strong it is in my mind. I think something like that is damaging to a kid. I think that the deliberate lies my church taught aren't good either. I was told that Martin Luther invented the Christmas tree and that the Bible contained no slavery (other than Hebrews being enslaved). But I don't consider it unhealthy or a bad thing to raise your kid religious as long as they're accepting of others.

&gt; Regardless of any flimsy justification they use, they are people that would, self-admittedly, persecute religious parents, as well as enact a form of 'social eugenics' by not allowing any positions contradicting their own to be passed on to the next generation, and charging parents that disobeyed this program as, at the least, criminal offenders, and, at the most, literally ripping their children from them and placing them in foster care.

I... would actually like to see anyone who says they'd persecute religious parents and place kids in foster care, because that sounds immoral as hell to me.

&gt; Please explain how any of this is the least bit okay, and isn't essentially just atheist ISIS?

Calling it ISIS is a bit far, though. No one's decapitating women or throwing acid on people or raising child soldiers or selling girls into sex slavery."

"&gt; continuing to make recommendations under the premise that this practice is okay. Shouldn't we be making recommendations that maximize the probability of the statistical inference being valid?

I'm unclear on what you're saying is valid/invalid here. 

In spite of the fact that nearly everyone thinks that the t-test is exclusively for location-shift alternatives (if you start with a likelihood ratio test under that situation, you can derive the t-test; for most people that's the basis on which they'd consider it a location-shift test), there are certainly cases where it works just fine in a broader class of alternatives (especially  if it is approximately location shift for a sequence of alternatives approaching the null). I have a relatively relaxed view about that, and won't disagree with the practice of applying it in those circumstances (particularly if power is adequate for your purpose).


But if we're discussing the original issue (my objection to: ""never use the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test"") you'll have to clarify the connection with whatever you're saying is valid/invalid here.

If you mean that you think that the rank sum test is somehow not valid in that situation, I don't agree; it applies about as well as the t-test does and in some senses, better, though the critical issues are whether - for the alternatives of interest under the assumptions you make - the significance level and power properties are good (or at least as good as you need).

"Straight from the TNG Technical Manual:

**2.4 STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY FIELD SYSTEM**

 The mechanical integrity of the physical spaceframe is
augmented by the structural integrity field (SIF) system. This
system provides a network of forcefield segments that compensate
for propulsive and other structural load factors that
otherwise exceed the design limits of the spaceframe. The
SIF applies forcefield energy directly to field conductive
elements within the spaceframe and increases the loadbearing
capacity of the structure.

I tried to buy him back last week as part of a package of Thielen+Golladay for OBJ+Mike Williams and was rejected. 

I point these out because A) I deeply regret trading him. (I held him since his breakout 2 years ago after getting him off FA). B) His value is skyrocketing right now. He's a target hog in a good offense with a stable QB and Coaching situation. The only thing working against him could age and injury history; he's 26 and never misses time. He's a WR1 until at least 2020 and you're going to have to pay up for him.

If you really want him, wait until the off-season and the inevitable drumming of Diggs articles will depress Thielen's value."

 It's hard to argue that the deaths of hundreds or thousands of Yemenis, the suppression of the rights of many women activists in Saudi Arabia fighting for the things MBS is being praised for bringing about should count less than the sad story of one journalist, who you don't even have any true connection to either (he's not at your Sunday church meet is he?)

Go for broke.  Commit to the guy.  Go where he goes.   Throw it all to the wind and just fucking GO WITH HIM.""*

I concur and support this message. I've told young women more or less the same thing as well. 

The issue, however, is that ""society"" and other stupid women have convinced the majority of young women it's fine to wait well into mid or late 20s to start their husband search. They all say the same thing:

""You're too young to marry in your early 20s"" or ""there's always a better man out there""...or my favorite ""there's plenty of fish in the sea.""

Ask a late 20s/early 30s woman if there are ""better men"" or plenty of great men available for women ages 28-32. At those ages all that's left are men these women never wanted in the first place. They eventually settle, marry an unfortunate and unsuspecting man, and then proceed to make the guy miserable because they spent their better years getting pounded and passed around by Chad, partying, drinking, and doing drugs.

High Value Men avoid these used-up women like radioactive plutonium. 

Because of observed slut behavior in most women I advise any man NEVER to commit, much less marry these used-up women. No woman shows up at age 26 innocent and untarnished from the last eight years of man-hopping ready to be a dutiful, loyal, and loving wife. They're all burned out and ruined to hell. Even worse is they demand the very best men - men they MIGHT have in their life had they started their husband search shortly after high school. 

It doesn't get better or easier for women for every year they stay single and on the dating scene getting pounded by random men. The good news is by the time I discuss this with most men, they've already confirmed these same observations for themselves. 

*""For women, \[great\] men like that come along once or twice and that's IT. And you do not have unlimited time to have the babies you all say you want.""*

"It's good to hear that you have both talked about it - as I'm sure you know, communication is one of the most important things in a LDR (or any relationship really, but LDRs especially).

Since you've highlighted that expenses is your major downside, I would just work on figuring that out. For example, the first few visits you might have to account for the costs more. You also might need to consider how often you two can visit each other due to her possibly not having a viable source of income for a few years.

It always makes a LDR easier when you have it scheduled out for when to see each other. This doesn't mean you have to have five visits planned in advance, but at the very least you should always have some idea of when you're going to see each other next.

I can definitely empathise with how you feel about the relationship; I felt like that too within a few weeks of being with my SO, but it made me feel a lot more comfortable about our prospects to talk about all the future obstacles that might come up.

Now regarding advice for specifically a new LDR - honestly, I would just treat it as a time to get to know each other, and figure out what works for your relationship. So figure out things like shared interests (that way you can see what you might be able to do together online), and experiment with different methods of contact (texting, voice calls, video chats, etc).

Personally I think it's good to be able to establish some stable routine, as you want to be able to maintain the interests, social life and other commitments you had prior to this LDR. While it's an important part of your life, it still plays a part of a whole, and I feel happier in my LDR when I've got other stuff going on too.

Hope this helps, and good luck!"

Instead of brokering a deal (which would have been very expensive to Japan) they attacked instead out of unearned pride.

"Your definition appears to be essentially based on being anti/pro hierarchy in belief.

So your argument for Nazis is that they believe in a strong racial hierarchy and therefore are right-wing.

For Tories, they believe in hierarchies to a higher degree than Labour.

Communists are said to be anti hierarchical so they'd be left.

Your definition works and it's reasonably consistent I think. I just think it depends how you define it.

If you had've focused on the collectivist vs individualist difference, the Nazis would become left. I can see people don't really agree with this definition. Although it does mostly agree with your definition: the Tories are right-wing, Labour are left-wing and communists are far-left.

So it appears to be down to whether you choose hierarchy or collectivism as the defining trait of the left-right dichotomy. Since people use hierarchy I guess I'm simply wrong.

Interestingly enough [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_political_spectrum#Relevance_of_the_terms_today) actually seems to foretell of our debate:

&gt; Libertarian writer David Boaz argued that terms left and right are used to spin a particular point of view rather than as simple descriptors, with those on the ""left"" typically emphasizing their support for working people and accusing the right of supporting the interests of the upper class; and those on the ""right"" usually emphasizing their support for individualism and accusing the Left of supporting collectivism.

It seems David Boaz also noticed the choice of left-wingers to frame the debate in terms of hierarchy and right-wingers to frame it in terms of collectivism."

And in terms of skin aging, how is that exactly impacting your health or functionality? Out of all body parts that age, and that cause health issues as they age, skin isn't one of them. It just gets wrinkly. 

 &gt; It's fairly easy for me to view it negatively from backlash to people trying to sell me a shitty idea on old men being who I'm meant to be sexually attracted to.

You have full and complete freedom to be sexually attracted to any adult you feel sexually attracted to. This is borderline irrelevant to the rest of the discussion, the point is that women are hyper-concentrated on their appearance (i.e. performance of femininity) and having an issue with the idea of aging because of *aesthetics* (reduced functionality, sure, but that's not what this is) is gonna be questionable from a radfem POV, especially if it's something only women seem to do. A lot of this is trivial if you simply ask yourself what men do in analogous situations? Do you see men doing elaborate skincare routines and fearing getting old because ""omg, my skin will be wrinkly""? No, because they see their bodies as functional, not as decoration. "

"Chiming in here because I‚Äôm also currently reading through Daredevil. 

1. Miller
- The Man Without Fear. This is the most modern retelling of the origin and it‚Äôs pretty good. DD season 1 took a lot from this. 
- 168-#191. I suggest jumping straight to where Miller starts writing in 168. He introduces Electra in his first issue and starts setting up Kingpin as Matt‚Äôs arch nemesis. All around a really great run. 
- Born Again. My favorite DD story so far. Fantastic read. 

2. Kevin Smiths Guardian Devil. Picks up on some ideas and threads from Born Again. Reads really well as a sequel to that in a way. This is also where I‚Äôm currently reading. 

3. Daredevil Yellow. This is probably the best place for this. 

4. Bendis.

"Mandroid Echostar is a really awesome yet super accessible prog metal band. Three exceptionally talented guitarists who have a perfect balance between being technically impressive while still being tasteful, a ridiculously good drummer and overall just a very underrated band. Both ""Coral Throne"" and ""Citadels"" are albums I would highly recommend to fellow CotF.

I recently really got into Dance Gavin Dance as well and if you dig them you would likely enjoy Protest The Hero. All of their albums are solid but my personal favorite is Volition. 

Lastly I highly recommend **The Contortionist**. They are a concept band but not in the same vein as Coheed. Their most recent album ""Clairvoyant"" is super experimental, super emotional, and gives me a ton of Coheed vibes because of how atmospheric and dynamic it can be. [Here is one of my favorite songs to give you a sense of their flavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOVyJmNQxmU).The generic summary of the concept of this particular album is addiction, (sounds shallow at face value, but its the equivalent of saying the concept for Coheed is a sci-fi love story,) but they dive way deep into it and do an unreal job of portraying the sensations of use and abuse as well as the dark sides of it.  

 The album they released prior to that called ""Language"" is probably my top pick album across all my favorite bands. The concept dives into the origins, process, and emergence of language among life, and how it allowed certain species to further evolve and thrive. (Shit was mind blowing once I started piecing it together) Seriously an incredibly atmospheric and engaging experience of an album, but it does has bits and pieces that are way heavier than Coheed.

"One of the most important and difficult things to understand about racism is that racists, by and large, have absolutely no idea that they're racists. They believe that they have a worldview that is based on the facts, and that people who disagree with them are either radicals (in the case of relatively mild racists) or part of a global conspiracy (in extremist racists).

Let's suppose, for a moment, that you genuinely are not one of them. The idea of blackness bears absolutely no behavioral characteristics to you. You want to dress up as Lando Calrissian because you like him. You're totally aware of how much of his original writing was racial stereotypes, and which parts really bucked those stereotypes, and you go through the entire evening doing only the latter, delivering an exceptional performance worthy of a Doctor of African American Studies.

The racists aren't going to see that nuance. They aren't going to understand the level of thought and detail that you put into separating out Lando's career, confidence, and love of capes from the tropes he borrowed from the pimp friends of TV detectives. They're going to see that you dressed in blackface and portrayed your understanding of a black character.

And they're going to do the same. Only, their interpretation of black people is going to be condescending, hurtful, and promote others to the same broad misconceptions they hold as fact. They'll play up the 'jive talk', the attitude, pepper in some of their own stereotypes, not in a purposeful act of mockery but because they think that's what black people are like.

A doctor of social studies could parse out the various important and critical details needed to wear blackface without doing anything racist. You're right that it's technically possible. But you probably don't have the tools to be sure you will, and even if you did, you encourage other people who definitely lack those tools to make asses of themselves.

Halloween is meant to be a lighthearted celebration. We all pick costumes around that. You wouldn't go to Halloween as a drunk driver if you knew that a friend of yours at the party had recently lost their daughter to a drunk driver. It's possible that you could do so without offending them, but it's something you could easily mess up. For the same reason, you shouldn't go to Halloween in blackface while there is racial tension in your country. Even if you don't fuck it up everyone will be on edge for if you do, and someone else is going to take it as an excuse to be insensitive later."

"&gt;When gas was super expensive did I want an electric car? Yep. What did part time job college student me buy? An old used car that I could afford.

That's a major issue *today*, but that will eventually change as people with more money change their purchasing habits.  After all, your old used car was originally purchased brand new by someone who was probably relatively wealthy at that time.  I'm guessing the original price of that car was somewhere in the range of 4-15x what you paid for it.  The same situation will continue to be true -- a 2019 Tesla Model 3 has a base price of $45,600 CAD currently, but in 2028 a used one will likely be selling for $2000 - $4000.  And what happens when companies like Kia/Hyundai come out with budget-friendly fully-electric cars?  If Tesla today can release a Model 3 at $45,600 CAD, I'd wager that in 5-10 years time, Hyundai can release a budget model for under $30K, and 10 years after that, a 10-year old used one will likely be $1500, right within the budget of most college students.  It might be a bit painful today, but that will ease up in time as costs come down."
"You're just punishing yourself by trying to get longshots in core with this TTK. I hate hardcore with a passion, so I won't go to HC just for headshots, even though it's ""easier"", but I'll venture out for a game or two for longshots.

In Bo2 I got all the one shot medals I needed with the S12 in core. It's obviously much easier in HC, as in core you literally need to barrel stuff for the one shot. I actually had a lot of fun flanking around and barrel stuffing a couple from behind. Used the same strategy with the executioner, to the point where I'd actually do really well with it."

Maybe their GM has fun losing ""eight hours"" of work as often as it sounds like (at least twice).  I assumed that it might not be fun and wrote about that. I tried to be constructive by relating what I learned about my own inadequacies as a GM from my own similar experience, since I saw so many negative posts in the thread before I commented.

But yes the Sith Warrior in general just has the most consistent story. All three acts lead into each other seamlessly, while the other stories seem to largely seem to just have individual arcs in each act.

So Dark Side or Light Side it'll still beat the others."

"Attack on Titan was a relatively small budget production made in Japan without any significant western backing or influence. Finding white actors would be difficult. Should they have cast white people to stay faithful to the story? Sure. But they also shouldn't have added a scene where the training camp starts a riot to try and kiss Mikasa, who then kicks the recruits into a cartoon style rolly ball.

To argue that the Major hardly looks Japanese is to say that the default person a Japanese does not look Japanese. This article sums it up rather well:

https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki

But in short, we perceive the default human as looking like ourselves, or the dominant media that we are used to. We don't consider the default human of the culture of the media from another culture to be different than ours, which is where we run into, is Naruto a white guy, is Aang a white guy, is Bleach a white guy, etc.

We also have more than looks to tell us what the race of someone is.

Edward Elric and Eren Jaeger have european names and live in European towns. It's safe to assume they were intended to be european.

Motoko Kusanagi lives in Tokyo and works for a fictional counterpart of an actual Japanese agency.

"Okay, here‚Äôs a new one I call it the **Lesbian Lamia Inheritance**;

**~Genegineering~**

**Scales -** I didn‚Äôt want furry nor feathery Lamias. (-1 Sex Appeal[SA]), (+3 Deviant Points[Dp])

**Enhanced Strength(31-3 GM) -** I cannot remember a weak Lamia. (+3 Viability[Vi]), (+2 SA)

**Enhanced Agility(28-2 GM) -** You can never go wrong with agility, never I say! (+2 Vi), (+1 SA)

**Animal Eyes(26-2 GM) -** Perhaps you‚Äôd like to see just how snake-like I can be! (+1 Vi), (+1 SA), (+2 Dp)

**Night Vision(24-1 GM) -** This goes with the whole Lamia thing fairly well, and if I hadn‚Äôt selected this then there would have been no Apocalypse, and I would want to make them liars... (+1 Vi), (+1 SA)

**Prehensile Tail(23-2 GM) -** I‚Äôm not sure if I have to buy this separately but I‚Äôm going to just to be sure because I want to pick stuff/people up with my tail. (+3 Vi), (+2 Dp)

**Boosted Healing(21-4 GM) -** While not mandatory for Lamia I‚Äôm still glad I have this. (+7 Vi)

**Tauroid(17-2 GM) -** Yup no other way to be a Lamia than with this. (+2 Vi), (+3 Dp)

**Pheromones(15-2 GM) -** Because I am a sexy, sexy snake, er... Lamia. (+7 SA)

**Prehensile Tongue(13-1 GM) -** Well since this is about ‚Äòlesbian‚Äô Lamias I couldn‚Äôt think of a better thing to pick, and the whole snake tongue thing. (+2 SA), (+1 Dp)

**Descendant Gender Ratio(12-1 GM) -** Obviously 100% Female 0% Male I can make this work. (+1 Vi)

**Incest(11-1 GM) -** Well this is actually handy with another modification later and I don‚Äôt want my daughters to be too lonely... (+1 Vi)

**Life Finds a Way(10-3 GM) -** Being able to have viable offspring with females is essential for my planned world takeover. (+20% Fertility[F])

**Sexually Mutagenic Recombination(7-2 GM) -** While my daughters will never inherit this I will eventually be quite the. Broodmother... I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about that... (+5% F), (+1 Vi)

**No Menstrual Period(5-1 GM) -** Lamias have no cycle, they are always ready. (+15% F)

**Large Boobs(4-2 GM) -** Well my tail gives me plenty of support, that and I just wanted big boobs on this build. (+5% F), (+1 Vi), (+5 SA)

**Gentle Pregnancy(2-1 GM) -** I wanted this for my future Kobold Daughters and I want this for myself too.  Don‚Äôt know why it doesn‚Äôt give at least a point of Viability since this is really handy. (+5% F)

**Easy Birthgiving(1-1 GM) -** Yeah see the previous selection for the reason here. (+5% F)

**~Personal Totals~**

**Fertility: 105%** I already am a bit of a broodmother aren‚Äôt I?

**Viability: 24** Not as much as my Kobolds but still higher than any of the Mates.

**Sex Appeal: 18** Way sexier than them ‚Äòbolds though.

**Deviant Points: 11** Almost half as deviant as them... kinda sad about that...

**~Mates~**

**Kennedy(11-11 Dp Total) -** I admit it I chose her purely for the money, I initially was planning on having no Apocalypse so it would have been vital.  Still even now I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm sorry I chose her as she is too good for any man but not too good for a sexy Lesbian Lamia! *Mutual Fertility;* (70%+105%)/2 = 87.5% F, *Viability;* (4+24)/2 = 14 Vi, *Survivability;* 1.

**Mila(18-6 SA Total) -** After reading about her heritage I just could not pick her especially since as the lab assistant I can probably get pretty good healthcare for our very strong daughters.  Also She‚Äôs good looking. *Mutual Fertility;* (90%+105%)/2 = 97.5% F, *Viability;* (18+24)/2 = 21 Vi, *Survivability;* 2.

**Zoey &amp; Zara(12-12 SA) -** Yeah I had wanted that mansion for the Kobolds but these two just weren‚Äôt deviant enough but I am sexy enough to woo them this time!  So we have a defensible mansion probably with a decent estate that we can utilize for various things once the initial madness dies down.  Also two for the price of three what a deal! *Mutual Fertility;* (90%+105%)/2 = 97.5% F, *Viability;* (20+24)/2 = 22 Vi, *Survivability;* 5

**~Apocalypse~**

**Rapture (+1 GM) -** And lo, ‚ÄòThe Almighty Troy‚Äô took the faithful into the heavens and the Lesbian Lamias inherited the Earth, just as it is written... LOL!  Ooh a Lamia in a spacesuit?  Is there art for that?  ‚ÄòCause there totally should be art of every creature in varying styles of spacesuit.

Well that was fun maybe something furry next time?"

"I've been following this case from the truther sub for a long time but I'm a newbie to SAIG. 

The more I thought about it, the more I realised how unlikely a conspiracy actually is. The blood in the car is the main thing that did it for me. No EDTA immediately made me realise that it clearly wasn't planted, because any other theory is quite frankly ridiculous. Everything else may have been planted but the blood is just too much. 

I think the only thing that would send me back to the 'truther' sub is if KZ got the rav and the blood wasn't Stevens at all because that would mean everything else could have been switched.

I've realised every theory that states SA is innocent is so far fetched in one way or other. It just all happens to have been perfectly planted...

I find it funny how people say ""He can't have done it because it is the most stupid crime ever. Everything was left in his vicinity or around his yard and yet he left no prints"". Imagine how furious this must make SA really hahaha! He will be sitting in jail knowing everyone is criticising his crime for being as moronic as it was and he can't say a thing. "

Ariel and Baldwin then conspired behind Behold and John Henry‚Äôs backs, whilst being in cahoots with Meade. John Henry obviously was 100% against Michael even being a leader for the warlocks, and Behold was for Michael performing the seven wonders before learning more about him, but had nothing to do with conspiring to kill the witches or being in cahoots with Meade to push Michael‚Äôs agenda. As such, only Ariel and Baldwin were burned as part of the traditional punishment for crime against a witch/warlock from one of their own.

"I don't agree with torturing people, but remember that morality is relative. The origin of the word ""legitimate"" is simply from medieval Latin legitimatus ‚Äòmade legal,‚Äô from the verb legitimare, from Latin legitimus ‚Äòlawful,‚Äô from lex, leg- ‚Äòlaw‚Äô - and that's how it's meant to be used.

As you suggested, legitimate is what whoever is in power (either by majority decision or concentrated power / wealth / resources / psychological control) decides it is.

That is *precisely* why we use ""legitimate"", because that's *precisely* what it means. What you seem to want to do is to define ""legitimate"" as ""morally digestible"" and ""subjectively correct"", when there is absolutely no such thing.

It's exactly why we fight wars - ultimately, it's to decide whose version of ""legal"" is the ""right"" one. I suppose that strict libertarianism would dictate that *no one* could make this decision for another, yet we are a social animal that pair-bonds and creates offspring, all sharing the same rock with the same circulating resources, forever and ever, until we explore the solar system manually."

She *chose* to abandon you when you legitimately required her support and were in a state of vulnerability.

"Personal feelings are all we have to go off of when debating morality.  There is no such thing as an objective moral truth, so all we have to go off of are subjective opinions.  In this case, moral structures can be radically different enough to make it so that while in your moral structure treating dogs and pigs as different requires a cognitive dissonance, in my moral structure it does not.

Also, I think I should clarify what I mean by ""looked into jobs"".  I don't really care about money and only really seek pay for what I do so that I can pay my bills.  When I look for work, I look for something that I believe is important enough to be worth my time and that I would enjoy enough to not burn out on.  It is all stuff that I would do for free if I was independently wealthy, I just try to make sure I am paid for it because I am not wealthy.  I would gladly pay to kill pigs if I believed it was a set-up that truly benefited the environment (too much of the places that would take your money fall into a [cobra effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect) issue).  However, most of the programs that I have found which would pay me to shoot pigs are conducted with ecological concerns in mind.  In particular, if I did that kind of work with my current job it would probably be through a government contract."

"Yeah [that was pointed out when KZ posted it](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/6q83n0/open_response_to_zellners_challenge/).  She was also [invited to an AMA](https://np.reddit.com/r/StevenAveryIsGuilty/comments/6q75lk/open_challenge_to_kathleen_zellner_to_do_an_ama/) where we would answer her questions, instead of her needing to pay us $10k.  One user even answered all her questions ([part one](https://np.reddit.com/r/StevenAveryIsGuilty/comments/6q13jg/zellners_stupid_questions_easily_answered_part_1/), [part two](https://np.reddit.com/r/StevenAveryIsGuilty/comments/6q22q4/zellners_stupid_questions_easily_answered_part_ii/)).

She [said postings on reddit didn't count](https://i.imgur.com/ZQ2AHNd.png), [very politely declined the AMA](https://i.imgur.com/m1Fl9zZ.png), and [had a complete meltdown on Twitter](https://imgur.com/a/p4BDW4P) calling guilters basement-dwelling criminals.  Basically said [the whole thing was a ploy to do criminal background checks on us](https://i.imgur.com/zZWEjD2.png) once she got our driver's licenses.  I'd highly suggest looking through those albums to those who have only watched the show and have trouble understanding why us ""guilters"" don't have much respect for her.

The whole affair was pretty cringeworthy.  (She was even doing that teenage girl thing where [she'd tweet images of quotes and say ""So true!!""](https://imgur.com/a/buHYtiB))  It was right after she filed her *first* PCR motion.  In that one, there was nothing about Scott or Bobby- she was naming Ryan as the killer.  (It didn't make the tv show, but she's filed a lot of contradictory stuff.  In the show I guess they tried to make it all one big theory.)  It was [very quickly pointed out that Ryan had a strong alibi at the time she accused him of planting the blood](https://np.reddit.com/r/StevenAveryIsGuilty/comments/6gbpo7/rh_was_at_teresas_house_and_siphoning_blood_from/), and overall reaction to the big brief she'd been building up for more than a year was not positive.  Even her biggest fans were saying [it wasn't the ""real"" brief](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/73s6yo/eskimo_zell_is_the_bait_brief_gambit_going_to_be/).  I don't think she took it well, and she quickly made up this ""guilter challenge"" and had her Twitter meltdown.

Honestly I'm not surprised none of that made the tv show.  It was a pretty dark time for Zellner fans.

Bonus humor:  I think she realized around that time when you typed ""Kathleen Zellner"" into google, one of the top ""suggested searches"" was ""Kathleen Zellner stroke"".  I think it's just because her mouth is always in that permanent sneer.  [She didn't like realizing that, though](https://i.imgur.com/MSKcWP7.png).  She also [took a minute to brag about what a good swimmer she is](https://i.imgur.com/u9QrEIM.png).  Since so many of those embarassing tweets were starting late at night and going until 2 or 3am, there was speculation the meltdowns were alcohol-inspired, so I guess she thought boasting about her swimming would do away with that speculation.  (It didn't.)"

"First of all, chill a bit.

You are in the middle of a raging fantasy.

First - are you being considered for management?  Get clarity on that.

Second - is your primary goal to fuck your current employer, or be this fantasy character who wins it all?

Third - do you have a non-poaching agreement already in place?

Fourth - develop the specific plan that sets you up for success

Fifth - can you actually risk losing everything?

To pull this off here's what I would do.

first off, I'd have been positioning myself as management from first contact with this company.  You haven't done this, and it doesn't sound like you even know what the proposed management structure for this new branch is.  *This means you probably have already missed the boat.*

Next, I'd confirm with my colleagues that they're looking to jump ship.

In a later interview (ie, earlier than where you are now in the process) I'd mention that I have several colleagues that I could recommend to staff up the department immediately, as they're looking.  Depending on my poaching contract, this moment is ideal to provide their contact info and let the other company reach out to them.

Then I'd continue to Ace the interviews, get a management position and a giant pay bump, and tell my old employer to eat my shit 

However, I don't think you're in a position to do this based on what you've discussed.  Introducing your co-workers is likely only to increase your direct competition for the role, because honestly if you were a manager-level person capable of pulling this off, you wouldnt be asking Reddit and ""thinking they're considering me for management"" - you'd already know they are, you'd have a plan, and be asking us instead to vet your existing plan.

You can't really be a Mastermind if you didnt start thinking about this until this late in the process - you've missed a lot of specific moments where you needed to start kicking snow to get the ball rolling into an avalanche and the timeline likely has advanced too far for you to gain control of the situation."

Whether it be big or small, force yourself to try something you wouldn't ordinarily consider.

There will be a huge base of players at release which I expect to drop off quickly when they discover this is more of a simulation rather than a game.  

Then the player base will slowly build back up when people discover why it is more of a simulation rather than a game.

"One of the reasons is there is a lot people that want to get involved. The indy wrestling companies, in particular, have no problem finding people to fill spots. There is also no way to filter thru prospective crew members so they usually just hire people they know or wrestlers who can't get on the card.

People are protective of their jobs and paranoid. It seems like full-time wrestlers aren't as territorial as the promoters/crew are, because the spots are more limited.

The easiest way to get into the wrestling industry, regardless of the position, seems to be training to be a wrestler or a ref. It's a really dumb idea if that's not what you want to do but most of the people that seemingly get hired are either former wrestlers or TV/Radio people."

"It won't affect your maps aesthetically at all. Understanding it conceptually is important though. Most engineering and planning firms/government departments will use it or receive record drawings, As-builts, one line diagrams and other CAD-centric work . 

it's often more technical or precise for the means of engineer/surveyor for their scope of work or specific project(not better).  Truthfully the most important thing for you to learn is how it works within the realm of your job. IE; The CAD---&gt; to GIS process. learning about seed files, which information is useful for your GIS data model. How you can sell to use GIS methods over CAD drawings.

"I'm not saying repentance is impossible for the evil brother.  He chose to progress down that path and deny God.  But, he's identical to the good brother in all these ways that matter.  If it weren't for his influence, he wouldn't have turned down the wrong path.  It was the influence that caused him to make the wrong choices he made.  It kicked him off down the path.  The good brother would have done the same, but he just happened to be influenced differently.

If everyone is influenced, and that's a variable we can just take right out of the equation, then why evangelize at all?  If influences don't matter, what's the point?"

My FIL and his wife live in the villages. Your description reminded me of it. We visited once during thanksgiving and it was nuts how much they decorated the public areas. 
"This probably isn't the response you're looking for - my husband and I married in 2009 at the age of 18. 6 months into our marriage, he cheated on me with my maid of honor and this went on both emotionally and physically for years. I always knew, but he would deny it when I brought it up and I had nothing solid (confession, messages) confirming my suspicions, so I tried my best to let it go but it absolutely festered. 

In 2011-2012, I cheated on him to get even. It didn't make me feel any better about what he did to me - I didn't *feel* even. I never told him about this infidelity and it's, to this day, still my secret.

In 2013, I found definitive proof of his cheating because a mutual friend left her Facebook open on my computer and I read their messages. It opened up a lot of old wounds after a few years of living well and being happy, even though that cheating was always in the back of my mind, and yeah.. I'm a hypocrite because I did it back and still let what *he* did bother me so much.

I've *always* held his cheating against me, even after years of proving he had changed and being faithful. We got divorced last year (11/2017) and a big factor in it was the way my views had changed about him, despite trying everything..

We had open communication where we shared passwords and social media.

We went to couples therapy.

We tried to have more sex.

We tried to go on date nights.

We have a child together who was born in 2013.. so we really wanted to try everything, and he was absolutely still in love with me but I couldn't make it work and I asked him for a divorce. The history and the length of the affair were a big factor, as well as the way he treated me and gaslighted me into thinking I was crazy when I knew something was going on but couldn't prove it, it was very much a totality of the circumstances that one day I woke up and I was like, ""I can't do this anymore, I will never be truly happy with this man.""

It sounds like you and him love each other, and I really hope it works out for the two of you, but despite my years of loving my husband and trying everything, in the end I ended up losing that love because I couldn't ever truly forgive him."

Picture is relevant in this context. Though, the character was not necessarily a narcissist either. We could likely hire one half of the country, to look at what the other half is doing. Sure as hell would create a lot of jobs. Though you're never going to completely stop ""the lone wolf"" types like Timmy McVeigh, using the skills that he learned in the military to murder over a hundred people. 

Doesn't seem that far-fetched to me that the mentality evidently espoused by Steve Bannon's favourite author, Jean Raspail, who wrote the novel The Camp of the Saints...The basic idea plucked from the novel, is that the United Racist States of America, HAVE TO murder migrants coming onto they're shores, because THEY'D CERTAINLY AS ALL FUCK would do it to them if the roles were reversed. Numbingly ignorant, to say the very least...Even at a base, ironic level.

Plus, they want to push the narrative that a DEMOCRAT did this? For the soothingly-numbed corporacrats, that would take effort. And we all know, that toothless democwats don't have the balls for that!"

Bond: Increased aura reading range for levels 1 and 2. It now reads: Allies' auras are revealed to you when they are within a 20/28/36 meter range.

Botany Knowledge: Increased values from 10%/15%/20% to 11%/22%/33%.

Sole Survivor: Increased aura reading disruption ranges for all levels. Also, the perk icon will now show as activate when the perk is disrupting killer aura reading that would have revealed the player.

I understand the speculation but never know for sure
"I mean it's hard because if you mess up, it's obviously because well, you messed up, that shows lack of responsibility and when you mess up can be often because of one time that you weren't responsible, something as simple as forgetting to do something can lead you to a loss or a death, or just a injury or just feeling uncomfortable

My phone got broken because I was changing on the lockers and forgot to take it out of my pants. He has done this sort of thing and broke some of his own things in the past you know but well, because he has to pay for someone else then that I guess just sucks for him and makes him mad as you said

Honestly, I wish I could just not tell him, sure I can keep my phone well and alive for a year and then get a job, problem is if I don't tell him, he's going to be pissed and well. What I usually do is leave the phone on my backpack since obviously it will not fall in there.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know honestly, I don't disagree with your reasoning on him being mad.... though, I think it's hard not to add how hard it is for him to deal with anger, I mean they 3 days ago left the stove on for probably an hour, they were sleeping and I realized as I went to my kitchen, and when I told them 2 days ago or yesterday they started finding who to blame, him and his mom, they don't even remember clearly what really happened or who left it on, accidents happen, people forget things, and I just find it dumb to start finding blame and someone to just complain on for something as silly as that (yeah, that did pose a danger, but still, what solution is going to come up from doing this? from just trying to start a discussion? it's a mistake, is not like you did it on purpose, you needed to sleep and forgot to turn it off once you were done making the coffee, you **forgot**). I mean, at least it explains why he gets that mad, to the point of just treating you like shit, but the whole reason I don't think is because of that, there should be more things like just how he things of me for example, I really hate my face it never shows how I truly feel (A smile from me looks fake when it isn't for example) so yeah, probably he just thinks I don't care because of that, no signs of me caring, it just sucks. It's also not like I can prove him that I care, this is just tiring"

Mathematics, as it is taught today, is an axiomatic formal system. You can refer to it as a formal language, if you like. Note that a formal language is a logical system whereas a natural language is something that linguists study (e.g. English). There's no problem in defining math as it is practiced, but if you want to get really philosophical I guess you could ask questions about how much of mathematics is innate knowledge or something similar. If you felt like doing that, then there would be a problem in defining mathematics.

There's also no problem in defining a formal language, so long as you don't raise any questions about the current definitions (which work fine for answering your question). For natural languages, I'm not sure - isn't that something linguists are trying to do? I would guess it is a big problem then, but unrelated to mathematics.

I should say that I'm not responding to your quote about those two men (p.s. please provide a source next time). I'm not sure what they think or why they think it, to be honest with you."

"&gt;Also, if you think this SA deal is the difference between an IMF acceptance and an IMF rejection, you clearly don't ""understand anything about finance"". 

hahaha what a childish rant. He said, she said. Whinging. Nothing concrete whatsoever, and deliberately misinterpreting what i have said. - Going to the IMF for MORE money and a bigger package WITHOUT the support we've received from KSA (where we're NOT getting charged the same rate as commercial providers) means theres an INCREASE in the risk of default, and you get worse terms! 

Going to the IMF for less, with $3 billion as a deposit from the Saudis in addition to a $3 billion oil import facility gives you MORE leverage at the negotiating table. 

Unless you, Nawaz or someone else you know can front the money to help deal with Pakistans BOP crisis i would't go any further. Its precisely BECAUSE of N League and the major incompetent buffoon parties of whingers of the past that Pakistan finds itself in this DIRE financial predicament.

"Your question ""why 50mg?"" Is exactly on the nose.

The juul is 59mg/ml by volume. That is an absolutely INSANE amount of nicotine. I used to use mtl clearomizers and then the og Kanger protank or maybe the protank 2 (this was back when Kanger made some dope stuff), and I would go to vaping zone which was one of the og dedicated vape stores, mostly an online business but they had a store in my city and these were people who knew vaping inside out because they were in it from the United States start. When I ordered 36mg nic in my juice they looked at me like I was crazy and tried to get me to go down, even though I was a pack a day + chain smoker, and not lights. One tiny mtl hit of 36 mg would give me a head-spin buzz even out of a 1.8 ohm clearo on an ego spinner battery. 

I had to drop down to 24mg max for daily use, and not because the throat hit was too much from the 36, I never get enough throat hit, the buzz was overwhelming like the first time you smoke. There is no way that nicotine salts are more potent in terms of effects than freebase if I can vape 50mg using 10 second dtl hits from an Icare, and from a chemical and pharmacological perspective it's virtually impossible for any salt version of a drug to be better for vaporization than the freebase version. 

I think the juul is probably a great option for smokers looking to quit, but if somebody doesn't want to break the bank it is absolutely hands down a better choice to just get an age old mtl pen mod like the one of the enduras and use 16-24mg freebase juice for 5$ a bottle rather than 45mg salt juice for 15$ a bottle."

""Per year"". Yeah only if you are counting since 2002. 9/11 killed far more people than every US Mas shooting combined. And the left does plenty of mass shootings too like the Florida nightclub, the Black Lives Matter shootings, and pretty much every shooting of a police officer. Oh and then there's overall shootings. The vast majority of shootings are done by blacks, which primarily vote for Democrats in nearly every election. In fact, the violence in inner cities is directly the result of Democrat politics, like using the welfare state to destroy black families and making legal guns impossible to get so that only criminal scum have guns."

"One thing you can check is in Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Battery Health, at the bottom, the phone will indicate if it‚Äôs supposed to be performing at peak capability, or if it is slowing performance down due to a battery issue.  This was prevalent on the iPhone 6, so my initial thought was that perhaps you updated to 12.0.1 from a software that didn‚Äôt have the battery management features, and that by updating they were enabled, which malfunctioned and caused the issues.  However I‚Äôm not sure if this was relevant to the 6s.

Have you had these same issues at higher charge levels?  Or when the phone is at a high charge level and also plugged in?"

"&gt;&gt; Yes
&gt;
&gt;Again, this is a neat trick.

I mean, this isn't even really a trick. It happens commonly. For instance, it's well known that eye witnesses are notoriously unreliable at crime scenes because they witness X and would swear they saw Y happen, and this has been confirmed in controlled studies.

If people can do this with actual events they witnessed, I am relatively certain I could do the same.

&gt;You should talk to a doctor about this to see if we can figure out a way to replicate it. 

As I said, this has already been replicated in a controlled scientific setting, with a study by Elizabeth Loftus in the 70s being an example. People believe X when Y is what they witnessed all the time. 

&gt;Accept: believe or come to recognize (an opinion, explanation, etc.) as valid or correct. Not to be equated with: consent to recieve. Example: If I move to hand you a red ball, you can either accept or reject to continue with the action of recieving the red ball. However, you cannot simply accept or reject the notion that the ball itself is red. Same word, different uses. 

Why can't I reject the notion that the ball is red? I don't see why I can't. 

&gt;To choose something is to make an active decision towards a particular subject. To conclude something is to arrive at a judgement through observation, evidendce, and experience. 

I'm still not following. In the face of all observation, evidence and experience, I can still choose *not* to conclude that X is true. It's irrational, illogical and all sorts of other things but I still absolutely don't see why you're claiming that I have an inability to choose a conclusion contrary to the evidence. 

&gt;Is that an example or something you actually believe?

As of this conversation I am now a Mars Goldist - I have chosen to believe that Mars has gold on its equator. 

 &gt;If the latter, can you make the sudden choice to not believe it?

Sure, I could do that at any time, just like I chose as of this morning to believe it. 

&gt;I don't want to be presumptious here but it sounds like you're equating the claim of a belief with actually holding a belief. 

Not at all. As of this moment I truly and earnestly believe that there is gold on Mars' equator. But that might change by this evening, I'm not sure. 


&gt;This is a falsifiable claim. Now try the same thought experiment with an undetectable goblin and you're closer to what Russel's teapot tries to demonstrate. 

By ""falsifiable"" are you meaning ""scientifically testable or measurable""?

&gt;The theistic and atheistic perspectic address the same question: do you believe a god exists? The theistic position accepts this claim while the atheistic position rejects this claim.

That's not a claim, though. That's a question. I'm not sure this is helpful since a question isn't a claim. 

&gt;An atheist is simply someone who is not a theist. 

Eh, you're going with (or at least very strongly leaning into) a definition introduced at the very earliest in the late 19th century. I side with Richard Dawkins and many others in rejecting the new definition for a bevy of reasons fleshed out by Atheists and Theists smarter than I.

To be honest, we have enough going on in this thread that I'm not really interested in hashing out the new definitions of atheism and agnosticism compared to the classical definitions. I don't think it'll get us anywhere and will detract attention from the other multiple threads we have going. 

Maybe we can pick this one up in another thread sometime in the future. "
