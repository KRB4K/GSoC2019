"Dude, the lack of reading comprehension. The ""strawman"" comment was because you were fabricating things to ""argue against"" when no one had mentioned any of those things (which was one of my main points, and which you obviously missed). And there was no way to ""realize"" you were a millennial without you coming out and saying it...I figured you were either old and bitter or young and dumb, so I picked one based on your posts in this thread up to that point. 

There's an article in Forbes about entitled millennials, and I believe it was something like Men's Weekly that had an article by a guy who wrote an entire book about how boomers are the reason we can't have nice things. I haven't included links because I think I'd probably lose my comment, since my phone doesn't like me to flip between websites while commenting (no 'banging at a keyboard', angrily or otherwise, sorry to tarnish your mental image of me).

Obviously there are good and bad people in every age group, just as there are good and bad people in every ethnicity, every country, every religion, every orientation and gender identity, etc. And quite often, older generations have a corner on the market when it comes to things like journalism, and they also often think young people are going to destroy everything they hold dear, so it's easy to hear/see more opinions against young people. Ain't bias grand? But you mentioned that this was the first time you'd ever heard of an older person being entitled, so I thought we were going to focus on that. My bad, I guess? 

And I find it kinda funny that you said ""I'm not gonna respond"" IN YOUR RESPONSE. If you weren't gonna respond, what was that all about? Strangest way to not respond that I've ever seen. 

Anyhoo, if you hadn't been so obsessed with feeling like you were ""winning"", perhaps you would have noticed... anything, really. 

Sorry I didn't reply yesterday, my husband was having surgery. He's ok, so I thought I'd revisit this, though I'm not entirely sure why. I'm certain that no words from anyone would change your smug sense of superiority. So, have fun with life, and I wish you all the best as you (hopefully) mature. Goodnight! :)"

"Did the Nebraskan locals they interviewed not get shown the actual ads before being asked to weigh in and give the news crew a sound bite?  
It's painfully obvious it's sarcastic...in jest...tongue in cheek.  
The Nebraskans they interviewed really seemed to come from a place where they thought the slogans were serious and that it was troubling. Did the news crew intentionally withhold that context in order to lead people astray of the slogan's intent and get interviews that had more emotion and covered what they felt was the necessary opinion spectrum they needed to capture for the piece? This reeks more of manipulation than anything on behalf of that news team. "

"&gt; Industry labs simply won't give you the code and I'd rather have them be a part of the academic community than doing their thing in parallel. 

Industry labs bother to publish in the first place because they want a good standing with the academia in order to attract top-level researchers.

If their publicly visible research output degrades to little more than blog posts and flashy demos, they won't be able to attract talent as easily, thus they have an interest to keep publishing to properly peer-reviewed conferences.

I'm sure my experiences have direct contrary experiences by other people, but I'm my experience with pixel phones, they seem to have much worse quality and quality control.

Audio recording quality on every pixel I've had has been really poor. I never got a 2 xl that didn't have ridiculous speaker rattle. My 3 xl is exhibiting both the app killing and photos not saving (luckily I have no screen issues).

"I see where you're coming from when you reckon he should laugh, which is a point I hadn't thought of. However, I feel that the goal isn't really for him to survive. 

He's not attempting suicide to make himself stronger, or to celebrate when he beats those 'impossible' odds. He's doing it because he's genuinely curious if there's anything out there that can kill him. 

Laughing after surviving an attempt would be more in line with someone like Doflamingo, like ""Ha ha! Not even a fall like that can kill me!"" 

Kaido's thought process is more so just to find something (apart from the sea and devil fruits) that is able to kill him. Again, he's not trying to survive, he's curious to see if he's able to die.

But this is all my personal opinion anyways, so take it with a grain of salt :)"

And by decent amount of time I mean like over an hour per day on and off  which I think is more than any mobile game should expect. With these new events if I put in the exact amount of time and energy along with spending hash coins on at least one trunk I'm still lucky to get half the rewards.

"It’s the fluid used to back flush the filter (kidneys).

If you have a water softener system, imagine that the main filter is your kidneys, the source water is the blood, the potable water is the filtered blood, the salt is the vitamins and minerals the kidneys need, and the liquid wash that runs the salt into the main filter is urine. 

Dialysis is the process of filtering the blood, in the same function the kidneys do, using machinery outside of the body.

Here’s the comparable:

By adding fluid to the salt and running it through in a different direction, you can clean the main filter. This fluid then gets disposed of as fluid waste (IIRC as a time if mild grey water).

By adding fluid to the nutrients needed by the kidney and passing it through the kidney and to the bladder, you clean the kidneys. The fluid nutrient waste mix then gets disposed of as urine. "

I am very much in love with her and so I knew I would wait for her, we did keep in contact however this was extremely painful for me but it was what I wanted. But she could be different. All I would say is don't drag it out for any longer than you have to, do it in person, try and do it as softly as possible but don't sugar coat - trust me any lies you tell will just cause more pain don't do it.

"I’m an Accountant and handle varying clients with a range of cash inflows. This situation is not at all out of the ordinary.

The legal / technical answer is that, regardless of what you do with the cash, it needs to first be recorded as revenue on some sort of business ledger or accounting system, which is how it would then end up as revenue on your tax return.

Are there any repercussions if we deposit the cash straight into our savings account or investment accounts?
 &gt; It’s generally advisable (depending on legal structure of business) to deposit to the business account first, then transfer to your personal account (a “draw”) - but that usually is not a hard requirement.

Will the IRS come calling if they see large cash deposits every few weeks (can they even legally see your bank deposits)?
 &gt; Not regarding the amount you’re speaking of. Search “Currency Transaction Report” (CTR) - banks are required to report to FinCEN / IRS for transactions over $10k in a given business day. So, $9k on Tuesday, then $9k on Thursday would NOT trigger a CTR.
(That’s just an illustrative example - having said that, never split deposits just for the sake of avoiding a CTR (referred to as “structuring”) - this is specifically illegal... and a CTR isn't something to be afraid of - if you have a legitimate reason for a cash deposit (business revenue, sold a car, etc), that's all good!).

 &gt; The government cannot directly access your bank records without a search warrant or subpoena - but there are some specific reporting requirements of the banks, such as the aforementioned CTR and, for example, interest income.

Hope this is helpful!"

"Tradition? (tradition!) Pegs for the outside strings nearer, inner strings further away, makes a certain kind of tactile sense, or maybe that is just what I've been used to for so long that it feels natural. 

If the nut is properly shaped, it will lead each string in a smooth curve from the fingerboard to the pegbox. Metal-wound G strings are not so thick that they have problems turning a corner with a quarter-inch radius, more or less. Before metal winding was invented, thick old plain gut C strings might have had enough of a problem with such a tight bend that some players noticed, and put them on the further peg.

"Even if The Major is a robot, the reasoning for a Japanese robotics firm to make it in the form of a white woman is at best, lazy - and at worst, self-loathing. It's a bad look, and the marketing for the film did little to establish the context for the role. It does not make things better that the film explicitly rewrote the ending to have it that the Major is ACTUALLY the brain of a Japanese woman in a white robotic shell - adding another layer to the baffling racial dynamics at play.

As for trans representation, how would making R&amp;T with ScarJo assist representation efforts? The only message it sends is to other cis actors, that playing trans roles is a fast pass to critical acclaim. It establishes to studios that trans actors are not necessary to tell the stories from their own community, further decreasing the number of roles where they have a fair shake at consideration."

lmao i wondered why you never replied. :D
"Lol, no. Actually, current real estate prices are so high simply because people can take more money from banks than they good a few decades ago. And by more money, I don't mean in absolute terms, but relative to what they earn. Current economics not only makes it nearly impossible for your average Joe to be able to afford a home without a mortgage, but makes it extremely disadvantageous as well:

Let's say you and your spouse each make €2000 per month, which is a typical salary for a Western European country. You manage to save 25% of that income so about €1000 per month. Congratulations, in 10 years you will be able to afford a €120,000 without a mortgage, which in most Western European countries, especially cities, is shit. Also, during those 10 years, you'll have to live somewhere, so you'll also burn a lot of money on renting.

Now, consider a mortgage with the same income. Not only you are able to afford more than twice that amount, you are able to afford it right now, so you can stop burning money on renting immediately and also in many countries the interest you pay on your mortgage is deducted from your tax base and you may also get other tax benefits, which in the case of people renting you usually don't get shit. 

Thus, this is what really pushes real estate prices to go up, it's debt. A house doesn't really cost that much to build, especially if it's built by a real estate developer which generally builds lots of identical or very similar houses which means they get them built fast and they get them built efficiently. But, of course, the corporate interests have taken this option into account as well, thus making it prohibitively expensive for people to build their own houses, due to permits, licenses, costs for connecting to utilities and so on. In Romania for example you can still build a house for much cheaper than what it costs to buy it, but only if you are very smart about it and know a thing or two yourself about building houses. If you go the Western route of hiring professionals to do everything for you, they will suck you dry as well. In the past, it used to be much cheaper to build a house than buy one, but those times are long gone.

"A+ is a good start, but you should understand that IT is a lifelong learning event and you will end up with a shelf of thick books that you've cultivated your skills from. You should consider more advanced certifications (MCSE, VCP, CCNA/JNCP etc..) in addition to a college degree. While you are studying, see if there aren't any opportunities at the college for internship or helping out at a lab so you can get those references. Volunteering for local IT jobs to manage someones website and desktop pcs may help garner references and the experience you may be lacking but may only be good for small IT shops.  


Also consider that if you are applying for enterprise class IT you will have much more difficulty getting the job despite your comfort with the desktop computer. That requires more infrastructure knowledge that you will need to familiarize yourself with. Setup a home lab environment and learn how to configure and manage it through the tools available. Do not forget to familiarize yourself with powershell if you work primarily on a Windows platform or bash for linux/mac."

"You can pretty much do anything. I would figure out if you are using short read or long read sequences. Most likely you will use short reads from illumnia, but if you are using long reads from nanopore or pacbio, you might need to use a different variant caller that is commonly used for short reads. I usually only use aligners for human DNA. I would reccomend looking at bwa mem for aligning the sequences to the human genome (hg38) to make a sam file. BWA is good for short and long reads. Then use Samtools or Picard to further process the sam file (and to make a bam file). Once you have your bam file, I would start with GATK to get your variants (a VCF file), I have never had luck with GATK for long reads from nanopore, but it works awesome with short sequences from illumnia. Then you can figure out how you want to further filter the variants playing around with GATK or with your own filtering preferences. There are a lot of good variant callers, just Google it and you can find some good papers on this topic. Goodluck! "

My advice: find out what how she takes her coffee, schedule 10 min on her calendar (yes, take the time to schedule it) and then ask her how you can help her the most and ask if there is anything you can take off her plate, even the most mundane bs task. First, it shows you respect her and her time. Second, it shows deference to her leadership. Third, it shows you are a risk taker and a team player. Fourth, it shows her that you can be someone she relies on. My guess is that she will appreciate the gesture and perhaps offer you some additional responsibility. Crush that and you’ll have earned her respect. 

Also, learn to know when NOT to pop in and ask questions. Use every resource you have to NOT have to take up her time. That shows some initiative and respect. 

Another also, if she pops off again, simply and firmly apologize for interrupting her and tell her you’ll schedule some time, however you would appreciate it if she would speak to you in a more professional manner. Then walk away.

The argument that they aren't being held prisoner by Israel because another country might decide to let them escape is not a compelling argument.

That would involve actually accessing each of the Palestinians views as individual humans, so if Israel wants to undertake that effort and asses the threat of individuals, that sounds totally reasonable.

While I know people enjoy complexity, for me it lowers the immersion. When I play my WAR, it feels like I’m performing meaningful action, where as when I play SMN I consciously am aware the entire time that I’m performing a specific rotation, so I don’t “sync” with my character as well. 

But everyone enjoys things differently, and some just straight up enjoy the idea of mastering something complicated, and that’s cool too.

Similar to the explorable room of unused models in God of War 1, but a miniseries that explores unused or new playable concepts of, say, Egypt, Mesopotamia, hell even Christianity. Just small bosses here or there. But honestly, if Kratos somehow managed to kill a god with immeasurable power the likes of Cthulhu, his mind would likely shatter trying to comprehend anything else in the Lovecraft pantheon."

"Never crit with indigion whatsoever. That's just conflicting damage sources. There's no synergy there.

Having crit means a LOT less mana on the tree, meaning your indigon won't really scale much at all. Not anywhere near as much as a proper indigion setups. So you're better off removing indigion and going a normal crit spell caster, take MoM for additional defence or stack some auras.

And honestly for your build I think this is the better option. Take MoM to counter the degen and provide a very good layer of defence and use crit to scale your damage. 

Or you go full indigion and your only damage source is your mana pool. Your passive tree is almost entirely mana. 

If you mix crit and indigion it's a worse build than going crit or indigion. Sure you can make it work if you really want to for whatever reason, in this game anything works. There's just no justifiable reason other than ""I want to do it so I will"". "

"To start with? The conclusion that ""conservatives like guns because they don't care about people being shot"" is pretty far removed from the conclusions in that article. In fact, maybe you should try reading it, since it's actually mentioned in the article.

Beyond that? The idea that gun ownership is an apathetic position just doesn't hold. Even if we assume that conservatism posits absolute selfishness, it wouldn't imply that they don't care about mass shootings. After all, they're just as likely to be shot as anyone else.

My issue with the implication is the total absence of supporting logic. It's not ""my guns versus their deaths"" any more than ""my death versus their guns"" from either position, at least in reality. "

Man every body is oppressed at some level you can't just make a blanket statement like that like it's a fact. I think trans people do get oppressed but so do a lot of other people for a lot of reasons. Its also important to note that trans people are all individuals and should eb viewed as such. I've met trans/queer/genderfluid college students who were very into victimhood and viewed society as one big oppression machine and I met one older translady who was chill as fuck and just did her own thing and never even talked much about oppression or trans rights.

"For sure the bright spot is a problem and I would request an exchange. I had the same issue when I bought the Aura ONE and Kobo exchanged the unit. A negative is that Kobo make the customer pay for sending the item and it takes a long time to get a replacement.

"THE WHEEL OF TIME. I can't recommend this enough. After transitioning out of YA with Eragon, etc. I picked up Game of Thrones and enjoyed it but was a little put off. The Wheel of Time was the perfect middle ground. I'd never considered the extremes that one can push the word 'Prophecy' to, but Robert Jordan sold me in book one. Sure there's tropes, it's really lengthy, and people can't seem to get past the 'tugs braid' meme, but this series is the epitome of fantasy to me. The magic system is incredible and the stakes are remarkably high. By the end of the series, I shed real tears as some of the plot points came to conclusion. Read the series as a whole in about a year. Will recommend this to any fantasy fan for the rest of my life. I've got a Wheel of Time tattoo on my forearm of the great serpent looping through the Wheel itself. My Ouroboros."

"Am 6’4, 230lb immunologist with a degree in Microbiology 

Short answer: sometimes 

Medium length answer: there are some organs that are almost always larger in tall people such as the heart and lungs due to the various metabolic and homeostasis needs of the body. However, being taller doesn’t mean I automatically have a larger liver or gallbladder for example. Think of it this way. If all the organs were scaled up proportionately to my height, I’d look very disproportionate. Additionally, the volume of blood needed to maintain my normal function would be massive and then I’d need an even larger heart and lungs. So you can safely assume a taller person probably has a larger heart, lungs, and probably GI tract/stomach. However, there is never a time where your entire GI tract and stomach will be in use at the same time so the difference in size probably isn’t that much. Even though my caloric intake is roughly 40% more than the recommended for the average adult, my stomach and GI tract don’t need to be 40% bigger. Could use the same logic for my bladder. I’d say the most noticeable difference would be in the heart and lungs. Normal human heart is about the size of that respective persons fist. Mine is about 30-40% larger than my fist. In general, my organs are bigger but not by much. However, if you tried to transplant, say, my kidneys into someone’s who’s 5’2, you might have some issues."

"     I once had a best friend that I grew up with throughout high school. One day, he was kicked out of his mother's house for bringing his girlfriend there and then she punched him in the face a few times (she was crazy too). I offered him a place to stay in my house. I gave him food, a job, and just a normal place to live. After about a few months of him living with me I could tell something was not right with him. Him and his girlfriend broke up every other day and he was acting extremely unsociable. I continued on to be a good friend even though I was cleaning up after him, being nice etc.... 

     One night a few more high school friends came over to hang out on a Saturday. We all drank a bit of alcohol and smoked a bit of weed. After smoking, we all camr inside the house. My best friend (the crazy one) goes, ""where is my weed?"". Everyone in the room looked at each other, we would never steal from each other. He claimed that someone stold his weed, bit really he had been smoking a lot of it. I told him to calm down, and if he wanted me to, I would buy him some more to be happy. He did'nt like this and then began to insist I was the one that stole it, and he was going to kick my ass if I did'nt give it to him.

     This is where it gets interesting, after about 1 hour of this.... My mom is woken up and comes downstairs and she hears him screaming. She told him to calm down, but then he continued to scream and call us racist white people and that we mistreat and hate him. My mom told him to leave the house at that point. He was furious and decided to get in the face of my mom. Immediately, I was filled with anger and I punched him right in the face. Next thing you know we were swinging punches and we both end on the ground. I was able to put him in a triangle choke, and I almost choked him unconscious until our friends broke everything up.

     It took all of my friends to remove him from my house, because he kept insisting that he was going to kill me. My father came to my house and also threatened him to leave. My father drive a few miles away and dropped him off on the so Ie of the road. Needless to say, but nobody was friends with him after that. He soon became homeless, got a drug addiction, beat his girlfriend up real bad (went to jail) and was thrown in prison for armed robbery a year later. This was about 4 year's ago, and I still think he's in prison. I grew up most of my life with him, and he never once showed any signs of being this crazy. It took us all by surprise and still does to this day.

In the run-up to the invasion, he was transmitting many radio messages stating that there was a build-up of troops positioned suitably to invade the Pas-de-Calais - this was where the allies wanted the Germans to believe the invasion would come."

That being said I think you are being the bigger person by stepping back and letting them get together, I strongly suggest that you move out if possible and maybe stop hanging out with them for a little bit. Get yourself some space physically and emotionally. Give yourself some time to heal and some time for them to reflect on what they've done to your friendship.

On a side note, maybe put yourself back out there in the dating world nothing long term but maybe a couple palate cleansers to get your mind right."

" 

The  singleton with its only binary operation is not a field because it does  not satisfy 1≠0. There are many reasons to have this axiom. Consider,  for example, polynomial roots over this “field”. Every polynomial has a  root, therefore, the “field” is algebraically closed, but the number of  roots doesn't equal the degree of the polynomial even if we agree on how  to define degree. Unless we insist for no obvious reason that the  degree of every polynomial is 1, in which case degree of product is no  long sum of degrees. We'd need to constantly exclude this “field” from  linear algebra theorems as well; reals would not be the only field with  linear order and supremum, etc.

Many texts  don't even consider it a ring, because you have to exclude it from most  commutative ring theory results. Alternatively, it is called the zero  ring."

And Mario definitely is not the only good game on Switch, I can name you TONS of games that run perfectly fine on the switch and are extremely good, such as: Zelda Breath of the Wild (game of the year from many different outlets), Mario Kart 8 DX (technically on the Wii U but still an amazing game nontheless), Snipperclips, Splatoon 2, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Mario + Rabbids, Octopath Traveler, and as you said Mario Odyssey. All of these games have amazing review scores and are praised by many, the Switch is one of the fastest selling consoles of all time, I highly doubt Nintendo has anything to be embarassed about."

"I recall experiencing similar pain in my striking arm. I believe the pain was mostly in the deltoid muscle or connecting tissues. I'm no expert but I think the pain had several causes:

1. Improper technique: too much arm and not enough body/core. Improving basic squash mechanics made the difference.


2. Poor overall conditioning: my body was not conditioned for squash. Hitting the gym and engaging in other complementary activities (cycling, cross-country skiing, etc...) should effectively reduce this type of soreness


3. Over-swinging: hitting hard is fun, adds pace and puts pressure on your opponent but too much of this can lead to injury. I still hit with power, but it's never really maximum effort and it's not all the time."

Bow users in the Constellation are more viable for a few reasons: 

* With the Secret Shop, Winter Bows are available for purchase, giving archers the distinction of being able to choose their opponent's weaker Defense. High-end 3-range bows are also more readily available. (Winter Bow You also won't ever want for short bows to deal with 1-range (although that's less of an issue because... see below)
* Enemies get much tougher, surpassing even the lategame enemies in the standard game, and being able to apply ludicrous damage to a Flier is a very good thing to have. 
* Most importantly: Ultimatum. Clearing the Galactic Arena gives you 50000 gold, an Ether Sphere, Galagar's legendary Tomes aside from Inferno, and the champion's weapon, Ultimatum, an S-Rank Bow with 20 Mt, 80 Hit, 13 Wt, 0 Crit, 1-3 Range, and infinite uses. Not for nothing does its description say ""The greatest bow of its time."" It's well worth fielding a strong archer just to use it.

Rachel easily has the best speed growths of the available Archers, though Nomad Troopers can reach a higher Speed cap. She won't get as much Str, but will get passable HP, good Def, and excellent Res. Later on, when enemies start getting ridiculously OP, you can max your stats with Galagar at a cost of 500G per point of HP and 1000G per point of everything else, and Rachel will charge headlong into enough of her caps to make this cheaper than with other units.

Her 7 Con will make using Ultimatum harder unless you pass her the Ether Sphere, but she starts very strong otherwise, and she's an excellent choice from the point she's available onward. I brought her to Tenth Star, and she held her own."
"The idea isn't really a form of punishment. Say that you played a game with someone that you didn't enjoy playing with. They weren't toxic with communication or feeding, but they were doing something like hogging the courier and that impacted mid really hard or they had came into a game pre tilted and made really bad plays. You don't really want to queue up with that person again, it's not your preferred choice. Now say there are 20 people queuing for a game. One set will be game A, one game B. If you're destined for game A, and the guy you didn't like playing with was also going to be in game A, then the system would just swap a dude from game B in. It's more about logistics rather than sending someone to low prio.

"&gt;Generally speaking I agree with you, but there is a general attack on the public education system in the United States (and has been for awhile). Both at a federal and in a great many cases state/local level. [The general Republican position to public education is to defund it, point at it's failings because they don't have adequate finances to appropriately operate and replace those things with school voucher programs and/or charter schools. This is THE position of the current Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_DeVos#Education_activism)

&gt;Now not ALL charter schools are for profit but a great many of them are. It's naive to believe that even a nonprofit charter school isn't making money. This is privatization of all compulsory education. The first thing that privatization will do is make education unattainable for those who can't afford it. 

&gt;It's hyperbole, but lets imagine a scenario of a world where in America only the rich are afforded the opportunity to receive up to a high school education OR those who are not in reach are in so much debt that its a hole they cannot climb out of (similar to what is occurring with college education in the United States.) THAT is the direction we are headed.

&gt;An uneducated populace is the easiest to manipulate and when schools can't afford to operate the populace gets more and more dumb.

&gt;I encourage anyone who thinks [Betsy DeVos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_DeVos#Personal)has the everyman in the forefront of her decision making process to truly look at who she is with a critical eye.

"The 3 minute rule.

If you are contemplating whether to do something or not, ask your self if you can complete it in 3 minutes. If so do it. Some people do 5 mins, 10 mins, etc. It generally should make you more productive if you follow through on it. Carries over to much larger, time consuming tasks in my experience."

"Why is everyone all about this guy?

He's... okay. Prolific does not always equal good.

He's finishing 1200-page tomes in roughly two years or less. I doubt there's much revising involved, let alone allowing the editor to actually do their job.

I enjoy him. His lectures are good. He seems genuinely nice. But his wheelhouse is most definitely YA, and it baffles me that people honestly believe the Stormlight Archive is some fantasy godsend.

Steelheart was wonderful, though."

That's not what Ryo did. Ryo was blocking the bullets from in his face. When you see someone aim dodging in other fiction, they're usually doing it from a reasonable distance away because if they tried to dodge rapid fire coming from right in front of them,  it wouldn't work out. What Ryo did was far more impressive. 

And even if he knew the time intervals between bullets of a Tommy gun, he would still need to be comparably fast to react to an 800 rpm gun. "

"I don't think that Echoes Act 3 can actually bust out any new ability as long as it rhymes- Act 3 just told Koichi that to justify his naming scheme.
My theory is that Act 3 places tiny sound effects all over the target, and in exchange for versatility has greater power. Previously Act 2's moves were powerful, but not super destructive. There's probably a limit to what he can do with Act 2's powers.
Act 3 may be capable of learning other moves, but Three Freeze is already useful enough on its own. By Vento Aureo, we can really see that Koichi's development has progressed a lot, so there'll be little need for another act or a super powerful new move."

"I agree, please find a new one. I found mine on Psychology Today Find a Therapist. You can search by keywords for expertise such as abuse and domestic violence and trauma recovery. It’s locally oriented (search by zip code), you can read a description of their expertise, message them, and when some of them return your message and call you, you can ask the questions others posted above and consider them. This is a unique circumstance, and some are “trauma informed” and some not. 

You also might want to check with the National Domestic Violence hotline website, you can call or chat and they can point you to local resources who might be able to provide connections to therapists who know about trauma and abuse, support groups, legal resources and such.

Best of luck to you. I’ve been to many therapists and have dumped more than a few, please don’t let it set you back in any way, and eventually the outcome will be a more helpful therapist than this one."

"&gt;Cop, Coppa or CopperThe term copper was the original, unshortened word, originally used in Britain to mean ""someone who captures"". In British English, the term cop is recorded (Shorter Oxford Dictionary) in the sense of 'to capture' from 1704, derived from the Latin capere via the Old French caper. There is a common but mistaken belief that it refers to the police uniform's buttons or badge being made of copper.

"&gt; I'm sure this will help Republicans a little bit, but in a broader way, I think it hurts our system of election. When we make our state and local elections about national issues, we circumvent the intention of our government which is that we're represented by local people who most closely resemble our views. This slide from electing local representatives to electing party mascots has been happening for awhile and for a lot of reasons.

You know, I understand your romanticized notion of ""elect a local guy who represents our local interests!"" but it doesn't really make sense in 2018 America for three reasons:

1. We live in an extremely interconnected, globalized world. I can pull up a chat client right now and talk to an Australian, instantly, for free. Local issues like ""hey this bridge sucks"" are kinda drowned out when there are large scale issues like ""Puerto Rico doesn't have any power"" or ""there's a genocide going on in Myanmar.""
2. We already have local and state governments to handle local and state issues. Federal representatives aren't there to deal with parochial problems, really, they're there to represent our ideas about how the entire country should be run.
3. In a post-earmark era, all policy is national policy, and if that's the case, you're going to increasingly see ideological sorting because ideology is derived from a combination of ethical foundation and material conditions (with the latter being much more important), and those ideologies represent beliefs about national policy."

Then so it looked less odd widened the rear wings with wider running boards to tie it all in.  At first glance it did look fairly normal.  Still couldn't work out how they accommodated the engine height. "

The Republicans fucked it all up when they decided to let the tea party to hold them hostage 10 years ago and now you're the party of Trump. Since you've decided to throw away any sense of worth for votes from the worst type of people at least admit it's become the party of neo-nazis, racists, bigots, and homophobes.

"OK.... but we see a study about how climate change is happening faster than previously thought, and you guys chime in with “the world is being destroyed and this dummy Harris is complaining about identity politics”. 

Then an article about voter suppression is posted, and you guys slide on in and it’s “whoa, one really has to wonder why Harris is worried more about SJWs than black voters rights”. 

Then an article about explosives sent to some Dem pols, and its “yeah but Harris will tell you it’s much worse to deny Charles Murray a platform at a college”. 

Like you can’t help yourselves. I’m saying: look we get it, you think there are more important things. So does almost everyone else (I wasn’t being facetious above, in my view nukes and animal mistreatment are tops for me). But stop impugning Harris for not spending his time talking about what you want him to. 

You say “but issue X is obviously worse than identity politics”, but it’s not obviously worse and even if it were, there’s many other good reasons to not talk about it - not the least of which is *everyone else already is*. 

I’m sorry for being  snarky above but its just getting out of hand. It’s not just you, but I see this shit in every thread.  Just do me a favor and try to stop yourself from talking about Harris and his “character failures”, and instead try to engage the topics at hand. It’s fine to say “he’s wrong about this, here’s why...” you can even explain why you think Harris ought to talk more about X, but this constant shit-posting about how Harris is probably a secret Nazi because he doesn’t like Coates or how Harris is obviously alt-right because he interviewed a guy who is skeptical about the impacts of systemic discrimination is just childish. But more than that, it’s spoiling this community. "

"I liked it! Mostly the phonology and the genders; those are really awesome! But there is a biiig grammar issue: you defined three tenses that you basically all used wrong.

First of all: imperfect is a tense, that's right, but perfective is an aspect. The difference is subtle: a tense refers to the time something happens (not necessarily relative to the present). You could for example have a past tense, a present tense, a future tense, a far future tense, a back-in-the-days-when-dinosaurs-walked-the-earth tense and stuff like that. But aspect is about behaviour in time. Is the verb completed? Is it ongoing? Is it about to end? Is it about to start? All of these aspects can be used in *combination* with a tense. For example, in English the two sentences ""I have eaten my dinner"" and ""I will have eaten my dinner"" both show completion (that is what the perfective aspect does), but one of them is in the past, the other one in the future. Oddly, you used the term ""perfective"" as a synonym for the future tense.

Then, subjunctive isn't a tense either, but a mood. Moods basically carry subjective information such as degree of credibility or your personal opinion. I like to think of it that way: say you have a statement, for example ""I eat the fish"" and you call it A. Then the subjunctive mood says ""I want A to be true"". Other examples could be ""I witnessed that A is true first hand"", ""I heard about A being true"" or even ""I disapprove of the fact of A is true"".

Now the important thing about the tense-aspect-mood model (see Wikipedia) is that a verb has always all three of these things at a time: tense, aspect AND mood (even if it's indicative (""A is true"") which is the most boring mood).

You don't have to get into too much detail there. Some languages get along with no tenses, two aspects (perfective to show completion and imperfective to show the rest) and three or four moods (indicative, subjunctive / conjunctive, imperative).

Then another thing I noticed: 2nd person plural inclusive. 2nd person plural exclusive doesn't make sense, because it would simply become 3rd person plural, so differentiating between a general 2nd person plural and inclusive form doesn't make sense either. But here is a little tip: since penguins tend to be family-oriented animals, it would make sense to differentiate between family member and non-family member.

But shortly after that it ends already... :

* transitive / intransitive verbs (just read about the topic. It's necessary if you want to understand some of the following things)
* the voice system (active / passive)
* adjectives / adverbs (also bear in mind that some adverbs don't look like it: for example in the sentence ""I speak with you about my day in English""  ""with you"", ""about my day"" and ""in English"" are adverbs)
* subordinate clauses (I know you briefly included dependent clauses, but please give this point especially much thought! Subordinate clauses can very often be regarded as regular parts of speech, for example in ""The man who looked at me, went away"", the subordinate clause ""who looked at me"" works like an adjective describing ""man"". You could even (ungrammatically) rephrase the sentence to ""The looked-at-me man went away."" This is a big topic to explore!)

But apart from that: would you mind sharing how you got the idea to create this language? I man, why penguins?"

Being young and not having a family I invited my parents to come check it out.

Nice spin. Anyone not actually eligible to vote would either throw these out, or would be denied upon submission to the County office.

Get about a 8 or 9, killstreak which should not be hard unless you are a beginner. Call in strike team and spawn trap or camp close to the enemy spawn. Easy 15-20 killstreak and if your lucky 25. You should soon get another strike team and call them out to finish the nuke! I’ve gotten 4 nukes like this so far but I play hardcore and spawn trap hard.

"Because in countries with higher access to birth control, equal rights, and higher education for women, the birth rate drops naturally and in countries where people do literally starve to death, you’re just putting more arbitrary restrictions on women, who typically have limited rights and autonomy anyway.

And it would do things like shame younger girls who get pregnant into discontinuing their educations, something that happens in developed countries.

When women have bodily autonomy, the vast majority don’t want to exist solely as birth engines.

China had a one child policy and it led to infanticide.  Japan didn’t but women are often pressured to work and success (there are other issues).  Japan is now worried there won’t be enough kids to support the elderly population and is trying to get young couples to bone."

"&gt; Left-wing LGBT people have defined 'hating LGBT people' so broadly that any dissent from their activism is treated as a desire for extermination.

You're the only person mentioning a desire for extermination. Meanwhile wanting to take away the rights of a group and wanting to legalize torturing children who are members of that group generally qualifies as hating that group, and both of those are part of the Republican party's position on LGBT people.

&gt;they may well not tolerate you anymore either.

There has to have been a before where they were tolerant of LGBT people for them to stop. So far, since less than half of Republicans are anti-gay rights and the official party platform is anti-gay rights, that hasn't happened. I think what you should say is ""If you don't stop pointing out how we want to take away your rights, we'll keep trying to take away your rights."""

"The state of Georgia. I got pulled over there once on my way to the airport for a deployment. I was under 21 and on an out of state license, so the cop said he had to give me a court date. I told him where i was heading and he said just wait three days and call and pay it. So i did. And when i got back i found out there was a bench warrant for me for failure to appear. I was arrested, held for a weekend (which is a story unto itself), and appeared in court. I got lectured about responsibility until the judge found a reciept that showed i paid. I still got probation for the speeding ticket, with a provate company to the tune of $100 a month. They wanted me to appear in person every week too, which caused problems with my transfer to a new duty station. I ended up paying the $1200 in one sum, and got paperwork to show i didnt have to appear, but two months later when I tried to pick up the commemorative pistol my team ordered during our deployment, my background check stopped me. Because i had a bench warrant, for not meeting with my probation officer.

It made me so angry i founded a micronation just to declare war on the state. Sent an official declaration to the governor too. "

"All I can say is don’t do Revitalash.

I tried it a year ago and while it _did_ make my lashes grow longer and fuller, it made my eyelids noticeably darker and I’m pretty sure it also worsened my dark circles. I don’t have terrible dark circles but I noticed a difference.

And as soon as I stopped the treatment, my lashes were itchy for a few days and started falling off more. But a few weeks later and my babies were back to normal.

Honestly, I just rub in some oil (squalane, marula, argan, anything moisturizing) and my lashes look better. Idk if they grow any better just don’t fall out as much."

"I don't really smoke spliffs anymore, but I am addicted to nicotine as well.

Its like the psychological reactions dictate the physiological ones. Jade in the last episode of Y&amp;P was me all last week trying to simply not smoke at all for awhile, no lie lol. Its definitely a self-inflicted issue, but it just what happens when you self-medicate with pot every. single. day.

"Someday, you’re going to be an old man, looking back on this time of your life.

You’ll smile, and then lie to them. You'll lie and saying that you were on the right side the whole time, and all along you were silently protesting the rapid erosion of our nation’s values. You’ll say you stood valiantly, albeit quietly with those who fought to keep this nation free, incorruptible. You’ll lie to their faces because hindsight seems so clear, and yet in the moment, it felt so right. You were never evil, you just loved your country the way you felt was best. You won’t tell them that.

Later at night you’ll unpack a hat from the storage box in the basement and wonder if you should burn it. You’ll wonder how your grandkids will face you when they see the evidence of who you were, what you believed. But you won’t burn it, because to do so would be to admit you stood on the wrong side of history. 

All these beliefs will bring you is shame and hatred as you grow to realize that this world is too big for people like you. "

No solo estamos viviendo las consecuencias de que ganara AMLO también el resultado de una linea de trabajo que pudo haberse hecho mejor y ahí tienen la culpa empresarias privadas."

"Thank you so much for your well thought out response. See the thing is, I know and understand everything you said. This is why even though I talked to my partner about all this when my sister first came, I didn’t bring it up again and just let him do his thing for her entire stay. I never pressed him, I want him to be happy and relaxed in his own home. 

I’m just upset now knowing that all this time his actions have made my sister feel unwelcome and stopped her coming out of her room to spend time with me until my partner went to sleep. I’m not asking him to spend every second of his free time with us, but if my sister comes out and sits with us, it would make a huge difference if he stayed for 10-20 minutes with us rather than immediately and obviously try to get out of the situation. 

My sister and I would be happy to watch/play/do things he likes and suggests, but he just prefers to do that on his own. I guess I wrote this post because I’m torn between respecting my partner’s wishes and not sure if and how I should approach him about making more of an effort.

"I am passing on information that I got some time ago from a gentleman in a pipe shop who was generally very well informed. ""Imported briar"" is important in one way. Some time ago, American pipe manufacturers started growing *Erica arborea* in the US. In its natural habitat, rocky poor soil around the Mediterranean with low rainfall, the root burls grow slowly and form a dense grain structure. When cultivated in the US, it grows more quickly which is good if you are looking to make huge quantities of Grabows and Kaywoodies but it has a looser grain which makes for a pipe that doesn't smoke as well or last as long. This is why old Kaywoodies have their collectors who would not touch a newer one.

Unbranded pipes could simply be pipes from better manufacturers that did not make the grade because of bland grain, sand pits, etc. If they are made well they could still be decent smokers."

"Oh, well that’s all fine and dandy then. That’s all that needed clarification. Sounds like a solid plan to me. The important thing is to make sure the queen is renowned as the queen. We can’t have her locked up in a basement. She must be put on display and such - on a leash, stripped of all clothing - to express her righteousness which is indisputably unmatched. She must hunt through the woods to gather poppy for her fellow male ants, to which we respond with some greetings in the basement. The greetings are such that the leash becomes one of several chains to keep the queen secure for a warm welcumming, which includes (but does not exhaust everything entailed) continuous injections of diacetylmorphine into the queen to assist in the biosynthesis of more diacetylmorphine with the gathered poppy unveiled in the woods by the dope queen, who crawled to find and store poppies as eggs which begin to evolve in response to a certain chemical release acquired through a particular physiological stimuli response. This introduces a cyclic relationship in which the queen and all her minions (the minions are very well-treated) represent a biochemical function of positive feedback loop of diacetylmorphine synthesis. 
 
Oh, and be absolutely certain that you chew the nails with dignity and to perfection. Otherwise, you are just simply dehumanizing and objectifying the queen.

"We currently spend 3.2 trillion dollars annually as a country on healthcare. Mind you, health insurance companies drop you for costing too much. They drop cancer patients and won't cover pre existing conditions. Born with cystic fibrosis? Sucks to be you! Now, single payer or what ever name you prefer to call it, would cost 2.4 trillion a year, that's not including allowing people to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. With a socialized medical system, all conditions are covered, meaning families who give birth to a child with conditions will be able to get the child healthcare without selling their homes and living on the streets. 

Edit: some studies show that socialized healthcare may cost only 1.82 trillion annually. So between 1.8 to 2.4 trillion, versus the current 3.2 to 3.5 trillion we currently spend. It averages out to roughly 5800 dollars saved for most Americas. That's 5800 dollars more to spend on consumer goods which drive a capitalist market. This is objectively good for America and American companies."

"Probably because our subconscious can come at us completely out of left field with no warning whatsoever.

My parents divorced when I was 2.  I went with my dad, but none of his later wives or my other female relatives really loved me like a mother (except one aunt but I didn't get to live with her very long).  It was something I was aware of but never really thought about.

In my mid 20s I called a girl I'd recently gotten out of a 2-year relationship with (we realized we both needed to go in other directions, but were still friends).  I was super stressed out, and just needed somewhere I could go that I knew would be calm.

We ended up on her bed, my head on her stomach, her playing with my hair.  I heard her heartbeat through her stomach and in moments I was bawling like a toddler.  I had no idea why.  I regained my composure eventually, told her how odd that was and that I had no idea why it hit me like that, so suddenly.

I laid there a little longer and a few moments later had a flashback.  I'd visited my mother when I was 13, and at one time during that trip she sat on her couch and I laid my head in her lap, and she played with my hair.

That was the only conscious memory I had of my mother loving me.  My subconscious knew, even when I'd forgotten.

On the plus side, I was able to get in touch with my mother again in my 30s and recreate that moment (didn't tell her I was, it just happened that way).  On the down side, she's gone now.  Two good memories are better than none, and now I know to have my current gf play with my hair like that now and then."

" I don't think the question of ""what policy has he proposed that will make a positive impact on the community?"" Is the right question really in regards to American politics and the basic idea of what America is supposed to be. That isn't an attack of your question btw. To illustrate my point I view that question as ""what has Trump done to improve the lives of people who like to have pineapples inserted into their rectums?""... ""um... well..."" I can't think of any other president who has said something as supportive as ""if you attack our lgbtq community, you are attacking the heart and soul of our country."" Both Clintons did not believe in government recognized gay marriage. Many gay people support him, even in the face of the fact that the majority of that community dislike him, same example of blacks for trump. The interesting thing (imo) about blacks and gays for Trump is the assertion by the left that because of their identities they aren't allowed to vote republican and that sentiment is echoed in their communities. So here you have people who belong to a minority community willing taking the slings and arrows in order to vote what they believe to be in their best interest. So the question could be even with all the people screaming racist and homophobe, why are black and gay people still leaving the Democratic party and dawning the label Republican  (#walkaway) if these claims are so blatantly obvious?

"In person, I deal with my abusers as minimally as possible. I do not live with them anymore. I only deal with them when necessary. That’s how you deal with an abuser. You leave and you don’t give them anything. Not where you’re going, not any of your sympathy, nothing. Cut off all contact possible.

But that doesn’t make my anger magically go away. I am not magically healed because they’re gone. I am still angry, and I know a lot of people are probably angry at this dude because of every heinous thing he did. Once again, the theme of “anger is a thing that happens” is coming back in. The anger is there for a reason, and I dare say for a good reason here. This dude was scum.

I am truly unsure now as to why you’re really worried about a dead person’s feelings. The practical answer when you’re faced with an abuser who can lash out at you for being angry is to leave. But we are on the internet and this person is dead so I’m really not sure where you’re taking me in this conversation."
"Hrmmm, ok. I like that plan. I’ll play with that tomorrow and see how it works out.

Chibbs didnt get interesting or good really until about seasons 2 or 3. Same with TIG really his big thing was killing donna and later on he grew as a huge character... I mean if jax wasnt good then that would make the show pretty trash so I'm glad he was a good character. But to say he was the star of season one is a stretch.

*NSFW*

[Episode 83](http://www.throughthecrate.com/podcast/2018/10/24/ep-83-if-you-know-you-know)

In this episode we provide our take on the resurfacing of the Pusha T vs Drake beef, Vic Mensa's BET Cypher and being called out, as well as the excess of progressive candidates for mayor of Chicago. We also discuss Noname's Room 25 and T.I.'s Dime Trap.  

Through The Crate is a podcast where we dig through cultural and current events through the hip hop lens.

"The thing about IDK that draws me to him is that he is one of the *hungriest* people in hip hop right now.

His voice alone wakes you the fuck *up.* He even did that ""Trippie Redd's Freestyle"" shit where he ripped XXL apart just for not putting him on the Freshmen list. It's refreshing to hear a rapper sound this confident."
"Understood.  My point being they can come up with any reason to justify it. 

I used to be a banquet cook when I was finishing up culinary school.  I had purple hair and black fingernail polish.  The GM hated it (I wasn't the only one)  next thing you know a memo came out about grooming standards and people having natural hair color etc.. or they would be fired.  This was a private fine dining club,  so I can somewhat understand.  Thankfully for us we were given a warning.  That being said, we were good at our jobs and had a chef that went to bat for us."

"Agree with this. Incinerator within range has the highest probability of unsaved wound. The psilencer has a slightly higher chance of OOA because of the D3 Damage so if you don’t want an incinerator take the psilencer. Psycannon can be good vs high T low armor like some Gellerpox but within 8” the incinerator is strictly better than the psycannon. 

The psycannon is cheap tho so you can take 2 guns and as long as one is a psycannon you can still give your non-Justicar GK falchions. If you take two of the expensive guns you have to have have a plain GK with only one attack which sucks if you ask me. 

I also agree that GK are better in melee than at ranged and their guns are ok but not as good as say DW. So generally I prefer only 1 gunner and then take a Daemon Hammer and the rest falchions. The DH is your high S high AP multi wound weapon which we don’t get as a gun. Taking an incinerator has synergy  with the rest of the Kill team trying to get into close combat. Plus advance and shoot is nice when you auto hit! "

Most of the uplifts at all the resorts are quite old and it’s all button or t-bars. Though Glencoe might have a new chairlift at the top this season.

"My great-grandma is over 90 years of age. She told me she voted for JFK in her first time ever voting. She's a Southern Baptist and went to church every Sunday. Dr. King and his people were organizing the churches to have their members register to vote and so she said, for the first time she had the confidence to register to vote because God willed it. I think of her when I see this picture. I'm sure she's at home now in VA. Dozing off to MSNBC. She won't watch CNN anymore. MSNBC is more for the Democrats she tells me. She's a truly unique member of the nearly centennial few. She preaches to us grandchildren about the rights of women, LGBT, and other ethnic groups. She went to a segregated school and so did her kids. The things she went through, she won't speak of. She bemoans how the foods we eat today ain't nothing like when she was young. She says nothing she eats tastes good like it used to. She'll never taste meat and dairy as good as it was in the 40s ever again. I know I won't meet anyone else like her ever again. These were incredibly strong people. And it's sad how strong they had to be at so young because of the ignorance that controlled this country. What I love about my grandma is that she isn't done yet. A lot of elders scowl at how things have changed and think it's enough. She still wants more and more progress and reform for this country. It brings tears to my eyes that a woman who spent years working in restaurants that would not allow her family to eat inside believes there is more progress to be achieved in 2018. It just fills me with awe and I can only dream to be 10% of the woman she is. "
"Yes, definitely start with index funds, such as Vanguard's Total Stock Market ETF (Symbol: VTI). You pay no taxes on unrealized gains, correct. 

An easy way to get started would be to purchase some VTI. It can get more complicated (as complex as you wish to get, in fact), but that's a great place to start. Later, when you have a bit more saved, you may want to consider both diversifying to other low-cost broad-based funds like that, and into some bonds too. A 'standard' rule of thumb people throw around is 80% stocks, 20% bonds.

Robinhood seems like a good place to start there.

"&gt; Technically, I'm negative $17 eBay bucks at the moment.

Call and get that fixed ASAP, or you'll not get any more bonus Bucks deals so have to spend $1700 within the quarter to get it positive again (1% rewards). If the refund was no fault of your own, you should get it offset. One time a seller had never shipped and it put my new quarter Bucks at -$25, and a call to conceirge got it fixed without a hassle (I offered to pay the $25 but they just added it to my Bucks to go a little above zero, out of their pocket).

I REALLY wish they'd fix the situation with refunds. Even if you have an unspent Bucks certificate for $500 from the previous quarter, if a return from last quarter processes it'll put your new quarter Bucks balance negative and ruin your chances at &gt;1% reward offers. All they have to do is subtract the refund Bucks from your certificate."

"Every language has its frustrations.  I just came to python this year from a history of C#, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C++, VBA, T-SQL, PL-SQL, and more languages I'd care to just forget... 

On the one hand, experience with different languages will help you think about approaches to problems a little differently (functional, statically typed vs dynamically typed, etc).  But at the end of the day, you're just pressing the keyboard to make a computer do things.  The language you use rarely *fundamentally* matters.

From a popularity standpoint, python is growing, and one of the most popular language around.  I don't think that's changing in the next 5 years.  Having been around a while, you can usually see these types of changes coming.  You won't get blind-sided.  I did Visual Basic at one point (SmallTalk, too), but you could see the rise of Java + .Net coming.  Then the rise of JavaScript, or distributed computing, etc.  Python's been rising for a few years.  There's always time to make the change when you see the momentum changing.

Python can cover a lot of ground, but what about the challenges outside of your core language itself?

1) Do you ever need to hit data storage (SQL, noSQL engines)?  Adding some breadth may help you more than a new language.

2) Or, maybe a better question might be the scale of problems you work on?  You mention pyspark, which at least implies large-scale data manipulation and some level of distributed computing.  Something to expand on?

3) What about environment?  Serverless? Cloud computing?"

"I don't know if you've ever watched Futurama, but I think the episode ""Godfellas"" does [a great job describing the situation](https://youtu.be/EL7e05pClKM) when Bender meets ""god,"" or an approximation thereof. 

Just because you can't see God doing something, doesn't mean He isn't, and it also makes no sense for Him to be super involved in everyone's lives, taking care of every problem they have because then there would be absolutely no point in existence. I think life is defined by change, and if everything is always good, then there is no life.

In addition, logically it makes more sense (at least to me) for the universe to have been created, than for it and everything in it (including the laws of logic) to have been all of a sudden spawned out of literal nothingness. Even the theory of evolution makes more sense if you have some omnipotent force guiding mutation and natural selection.

The truth is that it comes down to a choice. I agree that there is no more evidence that God exists than there is evidence that God doesn't exist, but that's why believing takes faith. 

Faith is knowledge without evidence. "

"Middy is harder because it has more randomness to it. Also hot tail literally kills atleast one person everytime.

Omega is more scripted so its easier to plan out, and the only real thing that is a trouble is Pantokrator 2, and even then its just run around and in/outs. But you can even use jump there so it isn't that big a deal. Not only that, they make Star/lar easier by removing the thought of the second swipe.

I will say the DPS check on 11s is harder, but the tiny lull at the end of enrage is also a downfall as it gives time for dots to tick a little, and even more if someone happens to raise while the party dies. No such thing really exists in 10s. And trust me, for a first clear when your heart is racing and mistakes are being made a little, that tiny few seconds can make the difference. My clear happened like that.

"Talking about the link that's in this paragraph.

&gt; While not from GOG directly, it feels related that in August the Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter account responded to an innocuous comment with a common transphobic meme. If you don’t know, GOG and Cyberpunk 2077 are linked via owners CD Projekt. One of these tweets could be explained as a stupid mistake. Twice is concerning, but three times suggests intent. **That suggestion has been firmed up by some internet detectives piecing together details on GOG’s Social Media Manager**, including articles they’ve written in the past.

Basically, it was discovered that the guy had written a somewhat critical article for a defunct site about Sarkeesian in 2015 and that he follows Niche Gamer on Twitter. This is the proof they have to burn him. GOG's social media presence is not just one guy. There is no proof whatsoever that he sent the tweet. Or that he's a Gamergater.

Note what Dominic says earlier in the article:

&gt; While other recent social media comments have earned GOG derision and the occasional scathing article, this one seems to be having more direct effects. **While I’ll not link to them for fear that they’ll be harassed**, I’ve seen a few outspoken indie game devs and streamers on Twitter requesting to have their GOG accounts terminated, even if it loses them access to all purchased games. Geek TV producers Zombie Orpheus Entertainment have also requested that their products be removed from sale on GOG’s video section, as covered by Gamasutra.

It is clear as day what this piece of shit is trying to do here.

See this too

"I think we could address the void between veteran pkers and noobs with a better rank and match making system. We should only match with people of a similar skill/experience level. A few games do this seasonally, which would fit well - each season you could end up in a different rank tier, and work your way up. Higher tiers could offer higher rewards. 

I also liked the idea a few others mentioned about always being skulled in the wildy for BH worlds. One of the issues in pvp is rewards, and if you risk but your opponent doesn’t then there’s hardly any point in fighting. Maybe that could be part of the of tier system, higher tiers are skulled only?

"Oh there absolutely were fascist currents/Russian Imperialism--Hell, Stalin started on the Jews before he died with the whole murderers in white coats anti-doctor campaign, but Stalin was also Georgian, and despite this ruled over Russians for the first time in Russian imperial history, and furthermore you can't reduce the entire history of the Soviet Union to Stalinism, and you can't separate it from Communism, because that would be intellectually dishonest.

Communism proved itself to be authoritarian, but Soviet communism eradicated Socialism and Anarchism at the root--SR and Anarchists were the very people overthrown in the October Revolution, the Czar abdicated in March. Communism did not share many of the goals of the left--e.g. the Soviets both funded  and infiltrated organized labor movements in the West and forbade unions in the USSR as bourgeois bargainers.

It was communism though--there were no borders within the Soviet Union--traveling to other Soviet states, e.g. Georgia or Ukraine was common, the socioeconomic classes clearly existed, but they were designed differently, with the party hierarchy on top, rather than individual landowners on top, in what was ostensibly a dictatorship of the proletariat. There was plenty of government oppression because there was an authoritarian state--leftists who talk about a dissolved state are advocating for anarchy, which is the sort of thing that got you shot by communists between 1917 and 1922. 

It still doesn't make it fascism, because fascism is specific and different and has other defining features. The word you are looking for is still authoritarian and still communism."

"The BC NDP wants the MLA to be in place before February budget speech rolls around in 2019.

https://vancouversun.com/news/politics/nanaimo-byelection-to-occur-before-february-says-horgan/

There is also a need to resign before nomination closes for the byelection as one can't run for MLA while being MP under the BC law though one can argue the loopholes. 

The fixed term federal election is October 21, 2019, and a federal by election must be called within 11 days to 180 days in receiving the notice of a vacancy.

Sure. There are ways to avoid the federal byelection or merge it with the general election, but the timeline is really tight given the circumstances and most attempt to avoid one would create some bad optics for someone and it relies on the BC NDP and LPC cooperating.

The word is the Leeds—Grenville—Thousand  byelection would be announced before next week is up and the Burnaby South by election will be lump with that one, so maybe the BC NDP will keep it close until then. However, I am having difficult finding a path to no federal byelection in Nanaimo Ladysmith as well using the current timeline."

"its literally completely wrong except that arathi has a level 120 version. all zones are currently in their post cataclysm state. the classic 1-60 world was destroyed and thrown away and you will not get to see any of it. you play through 1-60 in cataclysm zones. once you get to 60 you reach burning crusade and wrath of the lich king quests which are in their own continents and set in the past compared to the current 1-60 content.

then you go back to cataclysm timeline for 5 levels, then pandaria, then draenor. also without the endgame of each of these expansions the story will basically make even less sense than it already is. then you get to 110 where they decided to change the way they introduce changes so bfa changes only kick in at 110 to make things even more confusing. thats when darkshore and tirisfal change. you dont get to play through the darkshore stuff but you do get a scenario about tirisfal. finally when you get to 120 arathi will change into its warfront form.

so it makes no sense and is basically indecipherable but thats blizzard's forward planning for you."

"Odd how you found this out. But from iOS 10 experience with (I believe Saigon) somehow some way...I used FLEXible and one day it resprang my phone (even showed my custom logo) I shut it off by hard reset then it never loaded anything again... a brick bootloop.

"The ""do the right thing"" comment is a red flag for me too.  For one thing, it says more about your counselor than it does about you, it's insight into her worldview, and she seems to be saying that keeping up appearances by meeting societal expectations is more important than one's happiness and well-being.  

&amp;#x200B;

which- no.  It's not.  

&amp;#x200B;

There's one thing she might be trying to get at that I do think is true, regarding ""the easy way out"".  Avoiding conflict can definitely be a defense mechanism.  It can seem easier to end a relationship than to stick with it and learn to set boundaries.  I've done done it, probably most people have at some point.  But if that's the choice we always make, then we never learn to set healthy boundaries and we keep repeating the same mistakes in other relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

So giving her the benefit of the doubt here- maybe she's trying to warn you against Escaping vs. Facing the awkwardness of learning new and better ways of coping with people?

&amp;#x200B;

But here's the thing.  Some relationships really don't deserve to keep going.  You can leave the toxic ones behind AND continue to learn to set boundaries in relationships that are worth keeping.  for instance with non-tyrannical people who are willing to recognize you exist as a human being and don't try to reinvent reality to suit their own selfish whims.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is to keep learning and growing, right?  And it's WAY easier (in my experience, anyway) to do that AWAY FROM people who are constantly dragging me back to a place I hated being.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, IMO ultimately it doesn't matter whether or not your parents know they're being abusive.  Intentional or not, the outcome is the same and there's no reason to think it won't continue to be the same.  

That's how it is w/ my Ndad.  I don't know to what degree he's capable of understanding all the ways that he hurts people.  I pretty much got over trying to figure it out when I decided that I'm not obligated to let him keep doing it regardless of whether or not he has some diminished culpability due to his NPD.

"&gt; Why would he even ask if he was just going to ignore it and say ""No, it has to be done in 5 weeks""?

Because the manager thinks that (s)he is motivating you to work harder by imposing a deadline on you.

Using deadlines as motivators of software teams is one root of the problem. The other problem is that software teams are not empowered to investigate, analyze, and decide what features the customer wants.

To put it another way: why run your in-house software team like a consulting shop? If you're adamant on doing so, just outsource. You'll save a lot of money."

I warn people about the lactose intolerance and I ask them how much does the dog weigh if the dog isn't with them. Only the biggest dogs get a half a short cup. Anything smaller gets less. Small dogs get barely a squirt in the bottom. Puppies get a warning and a drop in the bottom if the owners insist.

Like I'm just saying let's be realistic. Do you call apple seeds poison? No. But you call concentrated arsenic poison. Because of the dosage."

I sat and made sure she was asleep and not going to puke in my bed, and spent the night on the couch in my floor's lounge.

"Making money and making a good product with depth and precision is not a mutually exclusive thing. In fact the two are intimately related. Of course they are trying to make money...and they are doing it extremely well. 

No one said Epic isn't doing events or seasons without making money in mind. But any entertainment industry (books, movies, gaming, etc.) all try to deliver a deep / fun entertainment experience in the process. If your *only* goal is to make money, the product will be hollow and lifeless. Fortnite certainly does not fall into that category. You can tell Epic really enjoys what they do and seriously care about their product. 

That being said, of course things will get messed up from time to time. Glitches, bugs, etc are part of the business. That doesn't mean they aren't trying to deliver a good experience. It's not in anyone's best interest for them to have to delay patches or disable modes (like they did earlier) because they made a mistake.

"Because the use of goats and chickens as pets is fairly new. They are normally considered lifestock. Means they are used in an agricultural setting, producing milk, meat, wool, whatever.

Pets are mainly companions. Originally  they also often served a purpose (dogs protect/herd, cats keep the house pest free) or were decoration or entertainment (birds for example).

So the use of goats, pigs, chickens as pets is fairly new in a western setting. I think that's why they are called exotic. Maybe it helps if you think about the word exotic less as ""foreign"" and more like ""irregular""."

I don't see him as a white savior, he wasn't a superhero..he just started to care for those kids and saw that there was only 1 way he could stop it before he died. So he did the only thing he knew how and went to war. 

He started off as an old thinking war vet who saw them as nothing but outsiders but then he realized after they took him in that they were great, caring people and you saw his opinions change over time and even enjoy their company more than that of his own family. 

I also completely disagree that the movie depicted him/his buddies as faultless, by the end he clearly realized that the way he viewed their way of life was wrong and they were more alike than he ever could have imagined.

"&gt; Alright then, thanks for demonstrating what my OP already said. You're against religious parents raising their kids according to their religion, and think it should be made illegal.

Wrong... again. I'm against religious parents ""forcing"" / imposing religion on their kids (e.g. via abuse of position / power, threats of hell etc). If kids make the choice to participate then fine.

How can you be so utterly pathetic at making distinctions? Is the world just black and white for you?

&gt; Yes, it's called a reductio ad adsurdem.

No it's called ""tu maldito estúpido"". I agree you've reached the absurd part, you just didn't do it logically, thus your assertion is simply that, an assertion, with no point behind it.

&gt; I'm not admitting anything, I'm just demonstrating the hypocrisy of it all.

Yes you are? You specifically equated sharia with atheism and then said it (law based on religion) is bad. Why?

&gt; What ""3 logical absolutes""?

Something you're painfully unaware of since you violated them (specifically the 2nd one), google is your friend.

&gt; A lot of them are, though. Pretty much every single one I've talked to on the Internet has been, at least partly, an anti-theist.

Yes because people done woke the fuck up and realized that while religion does have value in a cultural and historical sense, as a form of parenting / child rearing technique and habitual practice it there is fuck all it provides that cannot be found elsewhere and there are real negative consequences to it.

That being said there are plenty of apatheists out there, go look harder.

&gt; So you're admitting that you want the government to regulate what parents teach their kids?

Wrong, i want government to legislate regarding what should *not* be taught / exposed to kids. It's both hilarious and sad that you keep making the same mistakes. Furthermore how do you think this is not being done already?

For example video games and movie rating systems? What about education curriculums? Drivers licenses? Right to buy arms / alcohol / cigarettes, etc? There are things that ""kids"" are not taught / exposed to until they are old enough to understand the associated consequences, explain why a special exception should be made in this case?

&gt; Locking your daughter in a dungeon and raping her isn't the same as teaching her something that most people don't like/think is wrong, fuck's sake man, how could you possibly think those are the same?

She wasn't provided with a choice... parents indoctrinating their kids into religion, is that a choice? Remember : 

- ""Believe or you'll go to hell""
- Or one of my favorites ""My house, my rules, you go to church or else""

How many other BS arguments have you heard that deny kids choice?

Granted i'll agree that in some cases it's necessary e.g. kids don't wanna go to school, but it's in their future best interests they do.

What's the difference? The difference is if you support freedom, then you must also support maximal choice / the right to choose, you can't have one without the other. Likewise if something must be mandatory you need to demonstrate why that is the case.

I can demonstrate why school is necessary, why is religion necessary for young children? Note i'm not asking why religion must be exposed to children at a young age, i'm asking why is it necessary?"

Agree 100%. It’s not the resorts fault if people can’t be bothered to read a sentence or 2 before entering their credit card info. They are the same people who get mad at a store for not accepting a return when it’s wayyy past the time allowed to return something. If they would have just read the return policy on the back of the receipt they’ve had for months they would have known when to get their lazy ass to the store by in order to get their money back.

"Can you post a picture of some of your prints, good and bad? Or link an Imgur? If we can see what your results I can tell you what is most likely the root of your problem. 

A couple questions;
1) When you flood the screen are you using two hands on the squeegee or is one hand lifting the screen as you flood?
 1.b) Are you applying actual pressure while flooding, possibly causing ghosting?

2) where are your hands located? Center, ends, 2/3rds?

3) How much angle are you using (approximate)?

4) What durameter are you using (usually)?

5) Do you have a spacer at the end of your screen (nearest you) between the screen frame and the platen/pallet? Like a couple washers or quarters?

6) is the shirt sticking to the screen when you lift the screen?

7) how many passes with the squeegee are you using?

"you can do a full 'normal' install onto a removable usb flash drive.

You boot from your 'source' live usb, install to the 'target' usb. 

HOWEVER -  the trick i have learned, is to unplug, or disable  (in bios) all other drives.  The various installers i have seen, like to put the UEFI files on the first UEFI partition they find, which may not be the one made on the USB flash. 

other than that  problem to watch out for, the process is the same.

At least this has been my experience.

I just let the installer auto-partition the target drive. I find people tend to mess up the partitioning  too much.  

Example Layout, would be a EFI partition, A / partition, and perhaps a swap partition. But many disrtos can use a swap file.

"Hello! I have been playing a version of this deck for the better part of 2 years and I love it. Combining people on turn 3 feels so dirty, especially when you've thoughtseized and ioked them. Slamming tezz is so nice vs so many decks, make a but blocker it attacker, start digging and ult him next turn! Use him as a speed bumb while you find a bridge. 

Here's a list of cards and my thoughts on them in this archtype!

Talisman of dominance: I've been liking talisman, it can be a bit slow but in your build you are more on the ramp to 4 plan so I think it's good. If you end up making room for mox opal I'd cut one or two definitely, I'm currently only playing one talisman and it's on the chopping block for me. Sometimes it doesn't do enough I find. I've thought about mind stone but then not making blue is pretty painful for us. 

Thirst for knowledge: it's ok,necer impressed me because I would clog my hand for bridge and that's usually my plan A against a lot of decks so I don't want to make it worse. 

Pentad prism: I agree with the other commenter how this card is a trap. You can play it turn 2 but once you use it it's dead. Sure you can sac it to foundry but I've found that not very relevant. I think the mox opal package is a much better and more consistent ramp card. 

Mox opal: I see you're not playing any and I think that is a mistake in this deck. There's a reason people have been asking for this card to be banned forever (not because it's too good), it's a very powerful card. The 'right' amount of artifacts is about 22/23 minimum. I'm on 3 right now as drawing 2 is pretty awful but the starts it can give are pretty brutal for your opponent. 

Ancient strings: also a trap. Very powerful card, it just doesn't hit any of our threats. No foundry, tezz or whir and usually those are the cards we need to dig for. 

Serum visions: aggressively mediocre. I've played with it a lot in the past and it's never felt too great, always kinda slow but soemtimes it's what you need. 

Discard: I'm currently on a list running 4 inquisition, 3 thoughtseize and 3 collective brutality. I think discard is amazing in modern right now and exactly what we want to be doing. Turn 1 discard is so good post board vs all the hate they bring in. It helps us slow them down eniuefor our engine to get online and get then dead. 

Bridge: secretly the beat card in the deck(not much of a secret) I never play less then 2the list you are playing

Abrupt decay/astro: I never leave home without 2 of these in my board. I'm playing a more rainbow version of the mana sources(4 spire, 2 glimmervoid, 3 mox opal) and I love them. They are the best answer to a stony silence, leyline, rip, other random hate. And they can take out something else in a pinch. Also astro makes our Tron matchup a bit better, sometimes you just astro and surgical Thier Tron piece, needle Thier o-stone and can kill them before they have 7 lands, even then you'll have so many thopters it doesn't matter if they karn. Unfortunately the thopters are blue so watch out for ugin! 

Time seive: I swore by it when I first picked up the deck and slowly I realized it was too much win more. If we have 5 mana and the combo we should already win this game. There are extremely few corner case scenarios when it has been the nail in the coffin but having a mostly dead card the other 95% of the time makes it not worth it. You can usually whir for another disruption piece to slow them down and that was how I usually got it out anyway so why not just get the card that does more in more cases. 

Nihil spellbomb: very good right now. Someone said to play 4 in the main and that's waaaayyyy too many as we have whir when we know we'll need it in a match. I usually have 1 in the main, sometimes 2 depending on the meta at the moment. 

Pyrite spellbomb: so good, you obviously aren't running red sources but with my rainbow lands and mox. It's. A. house. Kills Bob, Thalia, scullers, meddling mage, freebooter, pridemage and many more, also just can trips vs control and helps turn on metal craft / is good with whir. You don't need to tap it to use its abilities so remember you Can whir with it then crack it after! 

Pithing needle: I always have 2 in my 75, it's so good imo. Stops so much that hurts us, Lili, raging ravine, all of trons stuff, jace and teferi, azcanta, etc... So much. Such a good feeling to whir in response to them slamming a walker. Also sometimes you can just get em by naming a fetch if they don't have any activated abilities we are worried about, and it helps with whir/opal either way. 

Mishra's Bauble: very good, helps me turn on spire and glimmervoid on turn 1, helps filter through your deck and makes some dumb starts with opal for turn 2 tezz or combo. 

Foundry/sword: I have tried versions with less then 4 foundry and I think its just wrong. I am on 4/3 as sword only works with foundry (and they always kill foundry obviously) but foundry can do things on its own. We are a combo deck first and foremost so why would we trim on our combo? 

Karn: surpassingly I have not tested with karn and I'm very tempted to now. He seems pretty insane tbh. Im gonna try a build with the same split you have and 4 talisman to ramp them out. 

Man I love this deck. Ask about any cards I missed and I'll happily give you an explanation!

4 darkslick shores

4 spire of industry

3 polluted delta

2 Island

"IMO it is about philosophy of use.  Humvee's fuel economy is about 8mpg highway, 4mpg city, with a 25us gal. tank.  it weighs over 5000lbs unarmoured.  

It also has independent front and rear suspension, which has a lot more moving parts than a solid axle design. Those parts would be harder to come by than a bog standard toyota, chevy, etc.  IMO there is as much a technical as ideological debate for offroad suspension types, and their followers.

"Yeah for some reason we got a lot of people over on YouTube calling us out for rinsing under running water. A little new/weird because we've often called for rinsing for 10 minutes under running water without a peep :) I suppose 15 minutes is the threshold? 

Sinks are generally ~0.5 gallons per minute at full blast (and we didn't have this at full blast) while showers are ~2 gallons/minute. So 15 minutes of rinsing is **at most** equivalent to an extra 3m45s in the shower, probably actually around half that.

Living in the Pearl River Delta, there's an abundance of fresh water. That said, I don't like wasting either so if you live somewhere like North China, California, etc where fresh water is a bit more precious you could alternatively soak for 60-90 minutes, agitating periodically."

[Here](https://www.down-syndrome.org/en-us/about-down-syndrome/health/) is a list of negative health impacts associated with DS. Note that people with DS require care their entire lives and parents don't always have the resources for that, and of course, often die before their child, leaving their child to be cared for by others who may not cherish and care for them with the same amount of love.

"Stick with it man. Battlefront 2 was my first FPS i had played in many years. I have been playing since launch and just now as of about 3-4 months ago feel like I have exited noob status where I was constantly getting steamrolled .I am not naturally good at shooters so it took me a long time to be proficient. I now rank in the top 1/3 of my team consistently sometimes even making it on the EOR leaderboard. 

As far as tips and advice, play with your sensitivity settings. Most of being successful and winning firefights is landing your shots and staying mobile. Try both 1st and 3rd person play,some people are better at one or the other. Always play the objective aggressively.  If you want to get way better at troopers play blast. You level your troops way faster that way and there are mo heroes to worry about. Pick one class and play it until you reach level 70 then move to the next one. Doing that specifically is a grind but helped me get an in depth knowledge of how each class plays and what the advantages/disadvantages are for each. Fee free to experiment with star cards. You may find one that really speaks to you  that others don’t often use. I play specialist a lot with trip mines, you can do so much with those and few people use them. 

Sorry for the huge random list. you will get better, it just takes time. Don’t give up.

Cheers!"

"&gt;Is it coherent to offer second chances if there are some things that are unforgivable? Can there be such a thing as “unforgivable”?

Whether or not something is ""forgivable"" is entirely dependent on the person that's in a position to do so.

I am personally of the belief that trying to force or coerce forgiveness out of someone, like what Carol has been doing, instead of just letting it naturally happen like with Byron, will ultimately only cause more damage.

Some people simply can't forgive somethings, usually if it hurts them bad enough and the perpetrator is unrepentant about it, but that doesn't mean they can't still find closure and move past it."
"&gt; 'm like 99% sure we are saying the same thing, ""You can't compare D2 to D3."" 

That's the thing though... I'm not sure we are haha. I'm speaking specifically about disliking the metrics you're using to compare the games, whereas I'm not really sure why you personally, feel we can't compare D2 to D3.

&gt; Criticizing past mistakes leads to improved future decisions. 

I suppose you could look at it that way, but to me, it just feels like senseless complaining about D3 lol, I mean after all, we all know D4 will likely have microtransactions regardless of whether we like it or not. The model has shifted since D3's release...

&gt; If they are working on an expansion... First of all, I'd say they are  awful at making business decisions.  You can't not update a game for a  year then drop a some huge content patch in the form of an expansion and  hope it would go over as well as it should.  Second, kinda stems off my  previous point, they haven't touched anything in a year.  I doubt they  would add an expansion to a game they haven't touched in a year. 

Alrighty. So I think this is the point of contention: I think everything you've just said here is silly and wrong. There's absolutely nothing wrong with creating expansions for games that people are still playing, that are still active, etc. That's not an ""awful business move"". As for ""I doubt they'd add an expansion to a game they haven't touched in a year"", I'd argue against that. It was THREE years between Reaper of Souls and the Necromancer DLC, and the content released in that three year period wasn't constant and steady, but relied on sustaining the game with minor updates.

There's no reason to believe the game is abandoning according to your definition. And even if it is, if they're releasing D4 right around the corner, does that matter so much? Tons of games stop updating when sequels are inbound to encourage players to play the sequel.

&gt; I'm not sure what proof you need to agree that Diablo 3 is ""abandoned""/not being developed/on routine maintenance.   

I'd need actual proof that the game is ""abandoned""/not being developed/on routine maintenance. But the issue I have isn't admitting this if it's true. My problem is that you're treating this reality as if it's inherently wrong or undesirable in some way, when I just don't see it that way. It feels inevitable to me. Idk.

&gt; Honestly, as long as the Blizzcon announcement is either D2 remastered  or D4, i'll be happy.  If its just the Netflix series or honestly  anything else, some of their PR people should lose their jobs.  I know  that sounds outrageously negative and over the top, but you can't stir  up the hype train about ""the forges here are burning hot"" and ""multiple  diablo projects in the works"" shortly before a Blizzcon and reveal a  Netflix series. 

Let's hope for a D4, because we can all appreciate that lol, as I'd replace the remaster with a D3 xpac haha. But At least we can generally agree on this. If there's literally nothing? Someone fucked up, *badly.*

"Generally speaking, I'd say that I'm anti-religion-ist. In conversation, I'd further ask you to define what it is you believe, and why that probably won't work for me. 

For example - I think it is the absolute height of arrogance for someone to hold any book and say ""these scratches of ink on paper come together and accurately describes a being entirely beyond our comprehension. Yes, the book predates germ theory and democracy without addressing either. But it *can* tell you everything you need to know to be in the best graces of a being vast and incomprehensible. In fact, this being is so beyond our understanding that the tales surrounding said being are filled with impossibilities.""

&gt;""But that's what faith is.""

Sure. But then you haven't given a case for why I should then *worship* this being.  A being is not deserving of worship simply because it exists and is the most powerful. From my reading, the God of Abraham is an absolute bag of dicks and is distinctly *not* deserving of worship. 

That said, if it was the difference between a *certain and infinite punishment* or a *certain and infinite reward* just for saying a few magic words before I ate my food and whatnot, then sure I'd say the magic words.  

Would a being that powerful truly be so petty  as to punish me or reward you *infinitely* over some words? The books tend to say yes.... is that justice? Is justice whatever the most powerful being says it is?

"Firstly, they had 8 months for this game, not 3 years (they had to scrap what they had done and restart I am pretty sure).

"It’s been great theorizing and talking with all of you, you guys have all been great. Hope everyone enjoys playing the game come the 26th!"
"I'm a mom to a 20 month old and I've been breastfeeding him this whole time, so as someone who's been through this personally I wanted to chime in.  

1. It's possible that the % of women who don't make enough milk may be as high as 10-15% (with certain groups at higher risk than others I think). So MOST women are able to breastfeed, sure, but if your wife is in the 10-15% of women who can't and your child suffers because of it then knowing that *most* women could breastfeed will be a cold comfort. I've heard from more than one mom that wished she had not been so hard on herself in the beginning to breastfeed exclusively at the expense of her child.  

2. hahahahaha. There will be a lot of trial and error in the beginning. It's possible to get the latch wrong ONCE, have your nipple damaged, and then spend several days in pain even with a proper latch because your nipple hasn't had a chance to heal. I spent a week yelling ""AAHHHHH!!!"" every time my newborn son latched on my left nipple because he had damaged it at some point and I just never gave the nipple a chance to heal.  

3. Don't marry yourself to this! First off, it's been shown that pacifiers reduce the chances of SIDS. Second, babies both like to eat and comfort suck, but if mom's nipples are damaged then a pacifier can give your baby something to comfort suck instead of her damaged nipples. As long as baby is eating often enough then don't freak out about pacifier use. Even newborns aren't stupid and will realize if a pacifier isn't feeding them. Third, *formula use can save breastfeeding relationships*. The first few weeks are SO HARD. It took days for my milk to come in, my baby was hungry and screaming, I was exhausted and the crazy anxiety kept me from sleeping. I was on the verge of a mental breakdown and supplementing with formula in the beginning saved my sanity and possibly saved my kid, who may have starved while I was waiting for my milk to come in.  

When my son was born he would suckle for hours in the hospital but never seemed satisfied. When I tried to pump I found I only made drops of colostrum--not enough to satisfy my hungry baby. He spent SO MUCH TIME screaming and lost 8% of his birth weight in the first 24 hours because he wasn't getting any food so we decided to supplement with formula. He WOLFED down the bottle and was finally calm! 

I felt SOOO GUILTY that I gave him formula and I was terrified that I had crossed a line and could never establish breastfeeding. But it was formula that kept him fed during the long week while my milk came in. When I felt too overwhelmed to practice getting the right latch while wrestling with a nipple shield, formula let me get a little extra sleep while my husband could feed the baby. Formula gave me a chance to regroup, relax and pump and tackle breastfeeding when I felt mentally able. As my milk came in fully we gradually replaced formula bottles with pumped milk bottles, and as I got more comfortable and confident with breastfeeding we transitioned to feeding from the breast exclusively within 3-4 weeks.  

My only regret is that I didn't let my son drink pumped milk and formula until he was content instead of restricting how much we gave him in each bottle in fear of overfeeding him. Once he was on the breast exclusively and could eat as much as he wanted he gained almost a pound a week because he was hungry!! His body weight and height jumped to the 97th/98%ile to match his giant 99th%ile head and it kills me to think I was purposefully letting him stay hungry because I didn't want to use too much formula.  

Ultimately I would recommend you take **EVERYTHING** lactation consultants say with a grain of salt, especially if your instructor wasn't an IBCLC. Some lactation consultants are really great and take both baby and mom's health into consideration, but far too many lactation consultants take ""breast is best!"" as dogma and cite cherry-picked, poorly designed studies as evidence that breastfeeding needs to be promoted above all else.  Mom's mental health is important and it shouldn't be sacrificed to ensure that no drop of formula ever crosses baby's lips.  

I'm pro-breastfeeding--I wouldn't have stuck with it so long if I wasn't--but I'm also pro-healthy babies and healthy moms. I would suggest checking out the Fed is Best Foundation. [Their feeding plan](https://fedisbest.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018-Edition-Feeding-Plan-for-Baby-2.pdf) gave me an evidence-based strategy for knowing when it was time to supplement with formula. They also have information about misconceptions about things commonly promoted by lactation consultants, like ""babies don't need much milk because their stomach is the size of a grape"" (not true). I liked having evidence-based resources on the real benefits of breastfeeding instead of the nigh-religious fanaticism that was peddled in the breastfeeding class I took. "

"No, it's not. A person who suffers a mental disease has every right to feel the way they want, seek help, reject it. You have the right to protect yourself and your health too, I know that awareness to mental health paints a need to empathize with people who suffer from them but you are also a person who has nothing more but good intentions going to someone who is not quite in their right mind to receive them. 

You can choose to stick by your friend, help her as much as you can... But if you ever feel the need to distance yourself don't ever feel guilty for choosing YOU or not putting up with someone's problems. That's the exact advice people  get when they talk about it in therapy and for a good reason! there's nothing wrong or unhealthy about putting yourself out of situations you find uncomfortable or tiring.

I do agree that we got away with some very blatant ones earlier that game, and the final one was called as a “make up” call of sorts.  But the fact that it was a perfectly legal play that time, and the timing of the flag (both well, well after the play was over and the juncture of the game) are what really pissed me off about it.  Also the fact that I see pick plays *all the damn time* in ACC games no less and it never gets called.  Ugh, rant over.  "

"Yeah. I was with this girl for two and a half years. I didn't notice the red flags that I was causing. I let my jealousy, possessiveness and over reacting to everything fuel up my ego and fight with her, show that I didn't care every day. Went up through months. She was the one that broke up with me and it was way too late when I finally realized the damaged I have done. She told me while we were dating, ""can't you see your slowly loosing me with the attitude that you have"". Didn't listen, and now it's just me, all alone, wondering if she would ever come back. I still talk to her, every once in a while but she says that she feels happier and more in peace alone. She said that she does want to leave open the door for a possibility of us ever coming back, but that right now, she doesn't want to be with me or in a relationship. Tried to tell her that I was willing to change and make things right this time, but she said it was too late and she already gave me too many chances. I wish we can come back soon, I've learned my lesson of not getting caught up with myself. Does it hurt being the person who caused this? Yes. Do I regret doing these things to her? Fuck yes. Will I ever get back with her? Only time will tell. To anyone that stumbles upon this message and is in a relationship and going through hard times. Listen, don't let the small things ruin this. You might feel to prideful to say I'm sorry or to prideful to to say, ""no, you are the one that caused this because..."". Learn to let the past go, learn to love without expecting things in return. Trust in your partner, communicate with them. If you see that they are a good impact on your life, let them stay, don't be the one to push them away for your character. Learn to be a better version of yourself. Love your partner to the fullest and don't get caught up on the little things. Give each other a break, let them miss you and figure out why you are so insecure in certain aspects of the relationship. Solve them together. Don't let such a precious person rot. Learn to water and take care of things."

"So let me walk you through this. First, since your debt has gone to collection ignore the original lender--they have nothing to do with the loan anymore (in most cases). Second, now that you have been served with a lawsuit you have two options. Option one is to do nothing. If you do nothing the debt collector will get what is called a ""default judgement"". What happens after that will depend on the state. They could try to garnish wages or even assets but just because they can doesn't mean they are going to do that. Once a collector gets a default judgement it is unpredictable what they will do. You second option is to fight the lawsuit. Whether this is a good or bad idea all depends on the details of your case but tbh you sound inexperienced and broke so fighting on your own seems a bad idea and with no money to hire a lawyer that is not a choice. I honestly doubt legal aid will be of much use but I agree that it is worth a shot, don't have your expectations up.

"I live a double life. One with normal, 9-5 job, family, and church group people, the other with a bunch of people that want to fuck cartoon horses. I can honestly say the side that wants to bone the horse is way more fun. 

Normal? None of it will ever be completely normal. Sex as a whole is very much taboo and freaked out over in public. But from a sex standpoint? It's really only a matter of time. You are looking at an entire generation of kids growing up *on the internet*. They are being exposed to freaky hentai from Japan, furry porn, pokemon porn, and right now My Little Pony is currently the top most rule 34'd IP on the internet with people making thousands of drawings a week. A google search for any of the characters from the show is going to pull up curvy asses and ponies in lingerie. 

Will we see people start to open up to more crazy ideas as this generation matures? I guarantee it. You can't play Valve games without someone rockin a lewd furry/pony/anime avatar. You can't play Fortnite without someone talking about the freaky bdsm sex he got into a few weeks earlier. VR is already introducing all sorts of crazy xenophile sex. You can bang furry girls, ponies (http://besti.love/), characters from video games, or whatever else your lewd little mind can get it's hands on. When I was a kid, all we had was playboy magazines and the start of furry sites when i was in high school. I cannot even imagine going through puberty with this buffet of crazy porn we have now. "

If the chair doesn't do anything only then should you contact the dean. FYI they don't like it when you skip the chain and go straight to the higher-ups because these things can typically be resolve before then. Also, emails are great because they're considered formal documentation which can protect her in the long run just in case the instructor later says he didn't know or she's lied. "

"Why are you making it out to be an either/or?

We went into this year with Cassius Marsh as our best edge rusher. That's frankly unacceptable for a team that, prior to an ACL tear or two, was hoping to push for a wild card spot. We spent our highest draft pick since 2005 on a guy who we were either were projecting onto a position he's never played or plays a position already occupied by our best player (at the time). These moves are absolutely on Shanahan/Lynch, not Saleh.

But Saleh is far from innocent. The team has been poor at tackling, struggled to line up in the right spot, and is frequently in the wrong spot in coverage. He's made some baffling decisions about how to use the personnel he has. These things are on him."

"&gt; Prequel fans

People have been clamoring for major prequel content since the game was announced, which is to say, this is probably the only major content (aside from the obligation for TLJ and Solo) ""event"" in the game. It is understandable since EA was [expecting to make major money with its former loot box system,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRXm2zFAmwc) and with the changed plans, there has been a major slowdown. It doesn't help that the reputation and controversy turned off potential customers despite the loot box overhaul.

On one hand, I don't mind that there is some trickling content rather than putting all of their eggs in one basket (much like what Valve does with TF2, CSGO and Dota 2). On that flipside, if Battlefront II came out with the current loot box design (or a Battle Pass system similar to Dota 2) rather than what got them into major controversy, then the game would most likely see a better array of major content for months.

EA thought they could treat Battlefront II like their EA Sports games. Heck, before the game came out, I saw that locking competitive progress behind loot boxes was a terrible idea as it was potentially P2W. After nabbing money from Ultimate Edition/early copy owners, the loot box system became a luck chance if you want to get certain Heroes/Villains before anyone else. 

There was barely a major uproar for co-op games (ex. ME3, Gears of War 4, Halo 5) that has a similar system too. 

Some executives and maybe a team of microtransaction experts all fucked up with Battlefront 2."

Because if form changes only make the machines more difficult and less functional and are therefore only there to make the machine more visually appealing or to make the machine more marketable to a certain group of consumers, then they aren't ""form serving function."" If Apple used to the be computer equivalent of an old school Volvo --  simple and focused on functionality and practical innovation -- then they are becoming the computer version of like a Jaguar...

"Hey sorry you are having problems.

We released a huge update today for the entire application and the web interface.

If you were mining before on the older application and were on the newest Nvidia drivers you could have been having issues.

If you check the ""Miner console"" from settings you should see 2 things to know you are mining and earning shares.

1.) new block detected
2.) shares accepted by the pool

If you are not seeing both of those things you may be running the application but not actually mining anything.

I would bet if you look at your miner console you are not getting any accepted shares. Thus not earning any sats.

Anyway for Nvidia devices the newest update should fix any issues related to this. If you update the application and are still having problems please let me know ASAP.

Thanks #GetThatHoney "

"&gt; I don't know much about much, but I work in nutrition as a clinical assistant and I'm in a dietitian degree program. Keto only works when people eat fewer calories. It's generally just a fad diet like anything else - it works by eating fewer calories and the massive results you see in the first month is mostly water weight. You can disagree and have your own success story, but you can't lose weight unless you eat fewer calories than you burn, that's just how it works.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Keto is about macros. Not calories. You can eat 2000 calories a day on keto or regular diet. But your macros are where the results come from. If you want to burn fat, you get your body used to eating fat instead of carbs. That's the whole point. Of course you'll gain weight if you eat 2200 calories on keto vs 2000 calories on a regular diet, but I guarantee you'll be losing fat. "

The process to get my daughter on it was not fun because first she had to try all the other stuff that didn't work at all. She was so afraid of the side effects of accutane that she didn't want to do it. But there were no options left. She said she just wanted to live with the acne for the rest of her life. It took me many months to convince her that we got this. That I would be right there in her corner encouraging and supporting her the best I can. She's only been on it since last Friday, so she's on her 6th pill right now. The first thing to happen was her lips started getting a bit dryer than normal. Then her eyes. And now her chin. Nothing horrible though. I've got her using the lip balm mentioned above along with a lip mask at night. Eye gel drops at night and then regular eye drops in the morning before school. For skin care she is using cetaphil face wash, cetaphil facial lotion and a rose hip oil. That's it so far. She's had no physical or mental side effects so far.

&gt;all of your post are fighting people online about how macs are better.

All? Really? You've read *ALL* EIGHT YEARS of my posts? Now who is full of shit? I like PCs just fine. I've got three under my desk cranking away as I type this.

&gt;No one that claims to be that old with the experience you have spends so much time being a young angry kid on the internet.

Yeah, Ok kid. You still don't know what the fuck you're talking about. You can't possibly accept that there's people who have actually *lived* through the entirety of the personal computer revolution. That's not really my problem.

&gt;At best your a help desk tech with some serious mental helath issues whose only encountered windows for the first time at your job.

Still making personal attacks instead of arguing the merits of your position.

#*LOSER!!*

&gt;At worst you’re a teen whose parents have bought him nothing but macs and being a young kid your identity is tied into the brands you buy.

My parents have been dead for decades idiot.

&gt;Why didn’t you answer my question about your favorite first PC?

Because it was frivolous and pointless. But I'll play along. the S100 based computers were great because of the wide variety of peripherals you could get for them. I ran both Z80 and 68000 CPUs. I had a pair of Shugart 8"" floppies that seemed like the coolest thing at the time. The down side was that it was all *very* expensive, and for the most part you were limited by the software that you could write.

Maybe the greatest of that era was the Apple II. Not because it was Apple, but because it saw such wide adoption. The documentation that came with it was fantastic. Full schematics and ROM listings. I still remember most of the 6502 opcodes, and important addresses in the II's memory map. It's ultimately what got me away from computers and into electronics. I circuit-bent the shit out of that thing. Even made my own cards.

&gt;nah I just realized its not worth my time to waste with a professional neckbeard / troll who literally has no break longer than ten hours from reddit

And yet here you are, *STILL* typing away....

&gt;For the love of god, go outside and seek treatment.

Oh fuck off already. You're the very thing you're accusing me of being. You claim to know so much, but haven't put up jack shit to prove any of it. Don't believe that I'm experienced? Who fucking cares? You're wrong, and no amount of you casting aspersions will change that. 

It's clear by your post history that you've never been married, or divorced, or owned a house. You *ACT* like you know it all, when your punk ass hasn't begun to live.

&gt;Realize you’re not the end all be all.

I never *claimed* to be jackass.

&gt;FYI someone with the experience your lying about btw wouldn’t have made the first fan boy comment that you did that started all this.

Your mistake is believing that you know as much as you *think* you know. You do *NOT*. Not by a long shot. If you did, you'd have **PROVEN** me wrong by answering my challenge. You would have found a PC with the *SAME* specifications as any given mode of Mac for cheaper, and beaten me over the head with it.

#YOU DID *NOT*

I know the problem is on my side.

From what you say then you fall in love, but is just for a short moment, and you have to maintain that love alive in some ways.

I believe I haven't found out how to keep that love long lasting for the moment. I think I need to understand something by myself. Like what I really want/search.

I do think I put people and particularly her, above me, but this is because I like to care much about other. 

It's so hard to make a correct reply, I really don't understand what I am feeling and what is really the problem. 

But I guess yes, the thing is I must build up and keep that love, instead of let him fade and try all over. Maybe I'm just lazy, and would like to have that feeling all the time, and I consider the person that make me feel like that THE one. But this is probably Impossible

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

It becomes a concern when it interferes with a persons ability to manage their life. It is also a trait shared by many creative, and successful people.

Cognitive therapy would say learn to recognize the cycles and come up with strategies to work around them. ie: avoid drinking or drugs in a down cycle as you can see this as self medication which increases the chances of developing addictions which will create another set of problems.

"I'm not so sure about that. I think they would've put up a better fight against Lock Jaw, but I'm not so sure that they would've been able to out-drive Donald, who, at that point, had done few, if any, repairs (modifications are different from repairs). And even assuming they were able to defeat Lock Jaw and claim the spot in the Round of 16, going winless in Fight Night beforehand wouldn't have left them with a very high seed, so they likely would've gotten put up against one of the deadlier opponents. I'm not saying they'd get 16th and be put up against Tombstone, but they probably would've been seeded somewhere in the teens, and that puts you up against Minotaur at best.

"Would you guys consider setting it so that the default comment-sort on posts was ""new"" rather than ""top""?

&amp;#x200B;

Other people may disagree (in which case, totally ignore me-- totally fine), but as the sub grows, threads also grow quickly. Posts can quickly get 100+ comments. This means that people who see a thread any more than an hour after it's posted really have no reason to post because their new comment will have just 1 point and will go down to the bottom of the thread, where few will see it. Sorting it by new gives all comments a chance to be seen, while people can still change the threads to see top if they'd rather."

"You are so wrong. They didn’t cover up sexual abuse. It was handled. Everyone just immediately jumps to it being “covered” up because they didn’t announce to the world that their son made mistakes. They also did not blame their daughters. 

They have never “physically” shown feelings of anger and frustration. That suggests violence and hate. They do not hate any trans person or gay person or anyone who has had an abortion. They disagree with it. I am SO sick of people automatically saying someone “hates” people just because others disagree with choices or lifestyles. They are a happy family. They do not have extreme anger just because they are strong in their faith that homosexuality is a sin and that abortion is murder. Not sure how you not ever feeling sad about these things relates to the Duggars. 

The Duggar children 100% have the ability to make their own choices. It has been said time and time again that the Duggar children each create their own boundaries when it comes to courting. Hence John David being able to surprise his family with him having a girlfriend (from the time they truly met and then started a courtship was about 2 weeks, and they were engaged maybe a month after that? This was in no way forced on him). Another example: Jessa and Ben chose a longer courtship/engagement time. They were courting before Jill and Derick had even met and yet Jill and Derick were married about 6 months before Jessa and Ben. Each child as free will when they come of age to make their own choices regarding what they do. It is not forced upon them. And statistically speaking, people who don’t have multiple partners are happier in marriage than those who are married and have had many partners. The Duggars follow God’s word (the Bible) and they live their lives to honor God. And they live better lives because of it."

"I have been thinking of introducing ""devil grass"" from the first Dark Tower book by Stephen King. It's like a weed people chew to get high that changes the color of their teeth and lips to a brown/green. Once they get started it's very addictive and gives a euphoric high.

I'd essentially have a drug epidemic happening as a backdrop for the early story, starting in Field Ward then spreading into the city proper. 

This would be the secret machinations of the Cassalanters who then offer treatment and antidotes to the poor and needy to further brighten their public image. Then invite the recovered devil grass users to their Founder's Day feast.

No.  Cognitive dissonance is when there is a contradiction in the mind of a person who simultaneously believes two conflicting things.

That conflict must be apparent to the person experiencing it, and not by an external source.

Personally, I put dogs in a different category than farm animals, so any potential cognitive dissonance related to your post here is thus resolved in my mind (or more accurately, never developed). Even if you think there should be a conflict with my reasoning, I do not, so I experience no dissonance."

So on and so on until you’re left with nowhere to live. Instead of fear mongering and spreading useless info, you could always realize that Earth, in and of itself, is a dangerous place to live and you could maybe do as almost every human before you has and prepare/educate yourself in basic survival on this planet. People have survived millennia because they learned to recognize signs of disaster and learned how to react to it. For example, the 2004 tsunami: local people immediately recognized the signs of a MASSIVE tsunami (large earthquake followed by vastly receding waters) and headed for high ground. They were the ones who lived through the disaster and were able to help rebuild their homes. “Live somewhere else” isn’t an option for, I’d say, about 80% of people on Earth, nor is that a viable and realistic strategy to deal with natural disasters.

Be prepared, educate yourself, have a plan in place. We can’t prevent Mother Earth from throwing us curveballs, but we sure as hell can’t run and hide from them at all times either, we can know what to do and when to do it. That’s part of what makes us human, our ability to problem solve.

Letting her know, with a gift or even just words, that her dog was special and you'll remember him/her (if you met the dog - don't be fake about it) will be very appreciated. You could also try going to /r/drawforme or /r/redditgetsdrawn (their submission rules are more strict) to see if someone will make art of her dog for her.

And this goes without saying, but you only said you like her and not that you're dating her - don't just use this as an excuse to get closer to her. It's good if you're just trying to help her feel better, but don't take advantage of her being sad and vulnerable. That would be gross."

"Nope.  I’m arguing that speeding is not what causes deaths, rather reckless driving or specifically driving much faster than the surrounding traffic.  I’m arguing that actively making phones work more slowly is equally as reckless because it slows the productivity of hundreds of millions of people which in turn results in many unforseen consequences, including and not limited to people dying.

For a company with this kind of influence to not do in-depth research as to the possible consequences of doing something on this kind of scale is as equally as reckless as speeding, not to mention its downright fraud."

"I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Japan were themselves seeking to take control over huge portions of Asia, and killed a lot of people towards that goal. Is imperialism better when it's Japan doing it?

Like, yes, the imperialism of Europe was an issue there, and that shouldn't be erased, but Japan didn't seek to combat imperialism by liberalising those parts of the world. They just wanted control over them as well. "

It doesn't have the Acropolis, sure, but it does have a cool young vibe to it (without the simmering political tension that always seems present in Athens), and there's a bunch of cool early Christian churches too.

I would 100% recommend not going to Corfu. Other islands are better, and Corfu has a huge issue with garbage - apparently the bin men have been on strike for a couple of years because the landfill is full. The government built a new landfill in an illegal place (too close to homes, water sources etc) so the bin men won't use it and the riot police are there to control the locals who hate it. In the mean time there's just enormous (and I mean ENORMOUS) piles of garbage just sitting around everywhere. Perfect example of how poorly-managed tourism can just completely ruin a place."

"I love you to bits for wanting to adopt them!  And I'm happy to spend the time to help someone bring home kitties!  

I would highly recommend pet insurance if you can afford it, but there are a few things to keep in mind: 

- Senior cats are going to be more to insure, have higher deductibles, and lower payout rate

- Unlike people, insurance companies are NOT required to cover preexisting condition in animals.  This means that if they already have something, insurance will do nothing

- You need to keep the insurance going.  A break in coverage could mean that thing they got diagnosed with is no longer covered


I recently insured both my kitties through Figo because I liked their coverage amounts and what they covered.  For each one of my cats it costs about 35 a month.  My senior kitty (12 or 13 years old) I think I have a 500 or 1k deductible, and it pays out 90% of medical costs.  You can of course raise the deductible and lower the payout rate for a cheaper price.  That's also for the unlimited plan.  They have other plans that cover say 10k in a year that are definitely cheaper.  I don't know if you can start at the 10k plan, they get diagnosed with something, then move up to the unlimited plan.  

Also ask your vet about pet insurance, they probably have experience with multiple plans and can give you their honest feedback on who does a good job!  Some vets even have a preventive maintenance plan where you get all their shots/checkups at a small discount.  I probably should have asked my vet what their experience is, but we were about to leave on a trip and I had a bad feeling so I only researched it on my own.

Having an emergency fund is also a useful thing, even with insurance.  So if your deductible for both kitties combined is 1k, definitely have 1k.  When you go through the pricing with your partner, do have some rough end of life conversations about the kitties.  Like if they cost more than 10k, how would their quality of life be?  What kinds of things would you decide to ease their suffering for?  It might also be worthwhile to talk to emergency vets in your area about the actual cost of an emergency.  I know a friend who adopted a puppy who almost immediately got parvo, and that was 1k.  But if it requires overnight stays, surgery, that can be SO expensive!  I got the unlimited plan because I didn't do the research, and the difference between something like 14k and unlimited was a couple dollars a month.  

As a side note, if/when you do adopt them, SPREAD THE LOVE!  Post that ALL over reddit on how amazing your senior kitties are!  Kittens are the cutest things ever, but they're crazy and their personalities are still forming and they're WORK!  Senior kitties tend to be super chill and wonderful, but because they aren't these tiny weirdly proportioned things no one wants them!  "

"Como grupo de interés, los científicos que están involucrados en programas como la CORFO o CONICYT por razones obvias siempre van a estar en contra de estos recortes. Los fondos que esos programas reciben son fondos que *ellos* reciben, y sin fondos no tienen trabajo.

&amp;#x200B;

Como discutíamos en el otro thread, siento que en esta columna se critican los recortes y hablan de la importancia de los fondos públicos destinados a investigación y tecnología, pero hecho de menos que los autores mencionen qué logros y beneficios han traído ellos al país (asumo que son científicos los que lo escriben). Nunca he visto el que se hable del impacto que han logrado los científicos gracias a estos programas, solo dicen que hay más demanda por los fondos que oferta de los mismos, pero más que cantidad interesa saber la *calidad*. No me interesa estar financiando con fondos públicos investigaciones de ""hobby"", honestamente. 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer de unpopular opinion: se critica también la falta de apoyo del gobierno y la falta de fondos para el desarrollo de deportistas en Chile. Personalmente, creo que el éxito de un deportista es algo completamente individual, y si bien no niego que es lindo ver la bandera chilena en las olimpiadas y más aún si viene con medalla, no me interesa financiar éxitos individuales con fondos públicos. Con la investigación científica pasa algo parecido, no igual, pero parecido. La investigación puede traer beneficios para toda la sociedad, pero también puede que los beneficios sean para el científico detrás principalmente. Si es lo último, hasta qué punto queremos financiar esas cosas? Ahí es cuando yo creo que la plata tiene que venir 100% del sector privado, y si no hay interés de las empresas, por algo será. No me creo ese cuento de que las empresas en Chile le tienen miedo a la innovación y no meten ningún peso en investigación porque son ""anticuadas"" o ""conservadoras"". Eso es una excusa barata. Las empresas invierten en lo que traiga mejor retorno peso por peso según el riesgo de su inversión, y si no invierten en científicos es porque hay inversiones mejores, así de simple. Eso puede ser culpa de los científicos, pero jamás he escuchado esa posibilidad (cómo se te ocurre que alguien vaya a salir diciendo en la tele que Chile no tiene suficientes científicos buenos)."

"I've been to the Holocaust museum, I've spent hours there.  Obviously academic sources like encyclopedias and museums will do a good job of covering the entire scope of Hilter's death camps.  That's not who I'm arguing against.  

As I've mentioned elsewhere, my problem is not with people who focus on the 6 million Jews. My problem is with people who talk about the Holocaust and only mention and discuss the 6 million Jews while completely ignoring the other millions of lives lost.  As if those lives aren't worthy of mention and don't matter because they were non-Jews.  This is anecdotal of course but whenever I hear anyone talk about Hitler's death camps, it's always ""6 million Jews, what an atrocity!   6 Million Jews died!  Hitler was  such a monster because... 6 million Jews!"" 

Essentially the message they're sending is ""Hitler was a monster because he killed 6 million Jews"" rather than  ""Hitler was a monster because he killed 11 million *people*"""

"&gt;He came out and apologized for arguing with me about the finances (he was trying to go back on things he had already agreed to give me). He said he said those things out of anger. He said I can have all the things he promised. He said it’s my “reimbursement” for my suffering. “I see how this is going to play out, Im the guy who ‘abused’ you and you’re the victim so you should get everything.”

Getting your own lawyer is really important. You really dont want to engage in any negotiation with the person that has been abusing you for years or discuss this stuff further with him. Instead, prepare for the financial and legal abuse thats coming. Get records together, financials, get all the titles and deeds and records and heirlooms and pictures out of the house. Make sure to have your passport and documents. And protect your self interest. Never expect a liar to keep their ""word"". Words are what they use to abuse you with, after all. 

I know you are angry. Just be sure to put that anger into the new atty and getting your documents out, safe, and make sure to get them all. And dont tell him or discuss anything with him. Hes going to try to manipulate you since hes still living there with you. Hes going to try to pull you back into place by faking all the things he knows you want him to be. You know hes not going to give you everything for ""reimbursement"" for his abuse. Im so sorry you are going through that right now. It will get better. Does your therapist have experience in abuse specifically? Do you have support outside of your marriage of friends and family? 

Its going to be about a year of a bumpy ride. But your future free from abuse is just past that. Its the light at the end of the tunnel. "

At work its an open door policy for everyone. Anyone at anytime can book a meeting with me and as long a my schedule is clear, you are going to get it. The kind of responses I get for taking reasonable precautions almost feels like ""thought police"". I just don't feel its appropriate to meet a woman working under me for something like a one-on-one dinner etc. I'm just not comfortable with that. And the general feminist response I get is that's sexist and we dont care what you think. Makes it really hard for me to empathize with the opposing view without feeling like ""well I dont care what you think either"". Or the MRA loving response is ""good on you boi.

"Today’s been a lot of back and forth with my insurance, pharmacy, and doctor. The doctor corrected the prescription but that pharmacy wasn’t saying why they couldn’t fill it just that they wouldn’t. After calling the insurance multiple times, it apparently doesn’t matter what my doctor says they won’t allow me to have more than one ring at a time. How I’ve been receiving them in the past like that, I have no clue. 

The insurance doesn’t care if I get a new ring every 21 days, though. So I’ve been instructed to go back to the pharmacy when it’s time to get a new ring, according to my prescription, and tell them to do a track back because they wrote the wrong prescription in the system. 

I’m living in the Deep South right now, and I’ve never encountered so much pushback to getting my birth control. In my hometown I could fill my prescription and then a week later get the prescription filled again. I’ve never had to adhere so tightly to the prescription before.

I refuse to give in to the entitled citizens who want to consider discrimination and inequality the norm when we should be fighting for the rights of those who had their voices taken away by the racists and misogynists who just want power over others, who *do not* represent what a majority of US citizens believe and hold dear. The corrupt institutions may try to push their narrative of bigotry and hate, but we are *all* distant relatives of the same Homo sapiens, we are *all* people who seek better lives and none of us should feel proud about stepping on others to get there because we won’t ever rise above that if we don’t put the effort in and try.

People like you don’t even try to improve your world view or your humanity, and you’re the problem that is stopping the rest of us from being able to step beyond the shadow of the past spilled blood of genocide and established hate that is touted as something to admire and fondly reminisce about.

"You are not crazy. You are you, and God made you. God would never ever turn you away because he loves, he doesn't hate. People should not twist religion to make it question who you are. Listen, I was raised Catholic. I get the guilt. It's the worst part of being religious. 

And your dad isn't crazy. It's the way he was raised, and nothing in his life has ever had him question his beliefs. We all have beliefs. The problem is when people make us feel guilty for what we believe in. The world would be a better place if we could all just agree to keep our mouths shut and live our own lives. 

Just know someone (me) wants you to know your not crazy. Gay, straight, bi, transgender, whatever. You are you, and embrace who you are. Worry more about you, and less about what other think. Hang in there, because you are not alone."

yeah might require some troubleshooting with cables and other people's pc's just to see if it's bad.

specs say:

* USB 1.1/2.0 (or newer)

The USB 1.x and 2.0 specifications provide a 5 V supply on a single wire to power connected USB devices.

quick copy pasta:
A unit load is defined as 100 mA in USB 2.0, and 150 mA in USB 3.0. A device may draw a maximum of 5 unit loads (500 mA) from a port in USB 2.0; 6 (900 mA) in USB 3.0.

"Terrorists don't always blow things up.  They sow dissent and discord.  They accuse the opposition party of treason and all sorts of malfeasance. Sometimes they are the leader of a country.  Never. in my lifetime, did I think it would be my country that this would happen.

But apparently it has.  In 2 years Donald J. Trump has accomplished a lot.  A lot of divisiveness, discord and hate.  Not to mention passing a tax bill that paid himself and took money out of most of Americans pockets.  Now he wants to pretend that he is really, this time, no kidding, going to pass a tax reduction for middle class Americans.  I say ""pretend"" because he knows he has no chance of getting this passed.  It is just a carrot he is dangling in front of his minions.

If you really can not support this man and his behaviour, please vote on 11/062018 **against** any and all representatives that are now supporting this regime when most of them said they never would.

So I've got some real bad fall off after Michel for RBs and I can't even start Fournette or Michel because of injury. I'd much rather have Chubb or Kerryon than one of the other 3 RBs for the time being, plus I feel like Fournette's situation is really murky once he comes back (between re-injury and usage w/Hyde and Yeldon). I recognize that this is more of a win-now mode, but I think my WRs are serviceable (or at least I'm hoping Baldwin and Cooper can pan out)."

"All the stories of injuries I've heard run a wide range in terms of how painful it is.

Regarding ROM, I, like you, lost some ROM after the injury.  Next day after the injury my knee swelled up and I could hardly flex or fully extend my knee.  When the swelling subsided 2 weeks later I expected to be able to fully extend the knee, but it just wouldn't go beyond a certain point.  I never recovered full extension until after surgery.

When I woke from surgery my surgeon said she found my old ACL balled up in the middle of my knee and was probably blocking extension.  Post op my passive extension returned within a few days and active extension returned within a couple weeks as my quad control got stronger."

"The shuttle was totally a platypus, and the program a textbook victim of divergent (some classified at the time) requirements that never should have been demanded of a single vehicle, but I think calling it a trainwreck is pretty simplistic.

"Not very knowledgeable about church history, but I can do theology things!

**TL;DR** God is omniscient and omnipotent, but chooses not to be because he wants our love for Him to be our own choice.

If we're discussing from an assumption of God's omnipotence, you're talking to the wrong guy! I subscribe to Open Theism which argues that while God may be Omnipotent/Omniscient, He isn't necessarily such within the confines He places on Himself. Or, to be more accurate, there are things He simply *won't* do, to a point of principle that He, practically speaking, is not omnipotent/omniscient. The most common example of this is the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, where we read:

&gt; Then the Lord said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.” (Genesis 18:20-21, NIV)

The rest of the chapter is a dialogue between Abraham and God in which Abraham pleads with God to not destroy the city because He might destroy any righteous there as well. God says He will not destroy it if he finds at least 10 righteous people, and then later sends His angels to search.

The question that should arise through all of this is, doesn't God already know all this stuff? Why does He have to send angels to search the city to know? (The short answer is that it was a test for Abraham, baiting him into speaking boldly, and in the faith of the rightness of his convictions before God)

A VERY clear example of this ""self-imposed"" restraints thing is Hebrews 6:18 where Paul is talking about God's ultimate fulfillment of His promise to Abraham. Paul says that God set his promise up on two things: 1) an oath 2) which he made on His own name, the greatest name of all. Paul writes

&gt;  God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie... (NIV)

It's oddly worded due to Paul's lofty language, but Paul basically says that God set the promise up this way to this is was impossible for it to be a lie. That is, it was impossible for God to do something (in this case, lie). BUT we know that it's not impossible for God to lie in general, because Jesus lied to his brothers 

&gt;""You go to the festival. I am not going up to this festival...However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went also, not publicly, but in secret."" (John 7:8-10, NIV)

(Jesus did this because the leaders wanted to kill Him and it wasn't yet time for Him to die, but he still needed to go to Judea during the festival to teach when the time came to do so.) 

So what's the take away from this? God has full omnipotent power, but chooses not it use it? Yeah, basically. The truth is that He does love us, very very deeply. But if we're going to love Him back, He wants that to be OUR choice. 

There's way to much of this than what I can fit in a reddit comment and I've done a very messy job so far, but I'll leave you with this: I once did a word study on ""omnipotence,"" and I didn't find a single occurrence of the word or it's concept outside of the poetries such as the Psalms (which, in Hebrew culture, were not didactic materials, and were meant for worship and praise, in which hyperbolic language was perfectly acceptable. So we aren't able to use them for detailed teaching, just as they didn't)."

"Really good question, but very complicated. This will be a long post but bear with me. 

&gt; Why do we have complex thoughts?

We don't know how we have consciousness. 

&gt; Is it possible that any other animal could evolve and be able to learn our languages and integrate into society?

Yes, other animals could evolve this way. However, it is unlikely in the current circumstances. First, it takes a rather unique set of skills and circumstances for this to come about, no current species meets these criteria. Second, I don't think we as the current dominant species would allow it, a void would have to be created and another species would then rise in to fill our niche - providing they had the right combination of traits and circumstance. 

&gt;  How do we know some animals don’t already have self aware thoughts?

We do have a few ideas of some species that likely have some kind of self-awareness. If that sounds vague, its because it is. Before we can get to the answer of this question we kinda have to unpack what it means to be *conscious*. The main issue here is that it is really hard to define consciousness and measure it in humans, let alone in other animals. The only way we can really understand them is through observation, and to some extent behavioural experimentation. These methods are imperfect, we only get a vague sense of what it is like to be them, no one can truly understand the inner workings of the animal mind.

But from these experiments and observations we have deduced a few things. Animals are complex beings, and scientists for the past few decades have come to understand that the divide between us and them is not black and white, but rather a continuum of shared abilities. Animals exhibit a lot of similar behaviours and can even do things that we can't do (even on a cognitive level). They have morals; they have emotions; they make and modify tools; they can solve multi-step problems; they have culture and traditions; they can lie and cheat; they know when they are being treated unfairly; they mourn the dead; they have complex communication systems; they feel empathy; and some recognized themselves in a mirror and are able to distinguish self from other. So these aspects of intelligence and cognition, and very likely many other aspects that we have not fully explored, are not unique to humans. Given the complexity of other animals, it is very likely were are not the only species to have consciousness, that is to say other animals also have *'theory of mind'*. It may be more akin to the consciousness of a 3-5 year old, but none the less, they still know themselves from others.  One way that we have determined this is through the [mirror test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test). About a dozen species have past the test, including humans who are about 18 months or older. However, it is worth noting that this test is biased towards visual animals, and doesn't work well for species that rely on other senses.

Another way to  tackle this question is to examine how consciousness develops in a human individual over time. **When exactly does consciousness begin in a life form that is capable of it?** 

First, it isn't like a light switch one day its off the next day it is on. It is a gradual change of the brain and central nervous system over time. We know that infant humans are born without a consciousness that this develops slowly from the time of birth over the course of many years, well into early childhood. For example, young children and toddlers can't lie. This is because they have yet to grasp the notion that other individuals have thoughts and ideas that are distinct from their own. They think everyone experiences and thinks what they do. But around the age of three the ability to lie begins to develop because they begin to understand that their thoughts and experiences are distinct. We know that some animals are also capable of deception and cheating - which is really interesting because among other observations it indicates to us that they have an understanding of self being distinct from other. There are other cognitive abilities that develop over time as well. For example, young infants cannot pass the *mirror test*. As I said, this ability develops around 18m in humans, but deception not until later. So you begin to understand how two measures of self-identification develop at different times within humans. There are indeed some species that pass the mirror test - dolphins, many primates, birds like crows and pigeons, elephants...do they have consciousness? Well passing the mirror test seems to suggest that they do, but is their consciousness like ours? How can it be different? If you took an animal who relied more heavily on other senses and failed the mirror test it wouldn't exactly tell you much. That animal could easily pass another test, better suited to their abilities (e.g. smell for rhinos).

Many other cognitive abilities develop over the course of infancy - language, spatial skills, memory, tool use (problem solving)...these all come together to form the conscious human. In other species other things may come together to form the conscious elephant, or the conscious chimpanzee. In nature there is more than one way to solve a problem, and the problem of ""consciousness"" has very likely been solved in different ways. So if we are just looking for animals that exhibit the traits we deem responsible for human consciousness then we might miss some that have other traits that are unique to theirs. 

Another critical aspect of consciousness is that you don't need to have language in order to be a conscious being. Language, in the modern human sense, enhances consciousness, especially the shared collective consciousness of a group, but it is not required. So even though animals lack language as we know and define it, that does not mean they lack consciousness.

**So what makes humans different from other animals?**

* Traits we inherited from our ancestors

* Large brain-to-body size ratio &amp; increased brain gyrification

The Armorsuit should be compatible with most any cases as it leaves a good amount of space at the edges. The Whitestone on the other hand will not work with some cases and if you apply it slightly off center can have problems as well.  

I had an Armorsuit on my S7 for a couple years and it worked perfectly."

"My ex husband and I used to have this fight. In hindsight, my problem wasnt about the fact that he didn't fight or argue, it was the fact that he was so ambivalent about every aspect of our life that it didnt feel like he cared enough about anything in our life or his. He was a pushover and I was trying to provoke any kind of reaction other than a shoulder shrug. 

To be fair and knowing this in hindsight, we both get how stupid the whole thing was and acknowledged that it tanked our relationship.

"I appreciate you giving Will props! He deserves it. He is in fact an incredible black actor and a hip hop pioneer. I am his biggest fan and a leading expert on all things Will, so I have to clarify on your last point about never hurting anyone:  Will was arrested on charges of assault and criminal conspiracy (among others) with his body guard. Nearly blinding a man- William Hendricks. It was one of his worst moments, but I think he has grown and learned from the experience. But as fans, we should also be objective and be careful how we portray celebrities. Again, to repeat, I am Will Smith's biggest fan (hence my username), but I am also a person with empathy for others and it's important to point out."

"15 year long friend ship. We were out camping, myself, him and his 7ish year long girlfriend.
The friendship ended because he was getting plastered and in a neighbouring camps tent. Laying in some other girls lap, while his gf was extreamly sick, at our camp. I was helping his gf while he was trying to get laid by some other girl. (Whom we later learned was high on extacy, because she had some weird come down later that night and was deperatly trying to find her baggy of pills.) Needles to say, I got pissed at him... It started to storm heavily, I got even more pissed and called him out on it after trying to talk to him reasonably... He was drunk and angry for calling him out in front of his gf. I got in his face still telling him off about how fΩ©ked up what he was doing was. He slammed my face into a tree broke my nose, blood pouring down my face, my shirt soaked in blood and rain. 
We had paddled into our camp site. My tent and most my gear was messed up from the storm that had rolled in, so I left it. I got in the boat shouted at them both to get in the boat... He bitched about lighting and not wanting to leave. His gf and I paddled back while he sat in the center of the boat bitching non stop all the way to the car...

 I went to the ER shortly after getting home, they dont fix broken noses... They threw several stitches in and refered me to a specialist to have it reset. (It was pretty noticeably sideways). My gf at the time had called him while i was in the ER. And he had apparently made some comment along the lines of, ' if he tries to report me for assault im gonna fuck his life up.' According to what my gf had tolled me...
We didn't speak for along time after that. I ran into him at the store, he said sorry for being an asshole and that was about the last time I saw or spoke to him again... 

Additional info, we were in our mid to early 20s... And everyone that night had been drinking.

"I'd suggest sitting down with her and talk with her. Communication is the best thing, I already know that you have tried but the response are always ""well, you did this"", I think you need to approach it a different way. Instead of saying all the bad stuff that she has down, establish ground rules (mutual rules). Start the conversation not by pointing fingers but state what is wrong with the current living situation. I had multiple bad housemates and it was irritating. The first few bad roommates I handled it in the worst way possible. I was too aggressive and said things that would hurt people and the whole living experience was just horrible. The best way in my opinion is to try to establish set rules and be civil. Hope this helps and good luck!"

"I’m not having the backs of any men at all, I’m just pointing out that in this instance, it was a woman using a term she’s allowed to use and everyone jumped to the conclusion that it was meant to be derogatory. Yes I have been catcalled, followed home, nearly kidnapped, called a bitch for not responding, etc. and I know there are plenty of cis white men that need to be put in line for the misogyny they breed that should have been dead decades ago. I don’t disagree with you on any of your points, except that calling out anonymous Redditors could somehow cause societal change. People come to reddit often because they can be a total asshole and not have real life percussions. Most of the time, calling them whiny and telling them not the use the word bitch just fuels their stupidity and prompts them to act even worse. We all know bitch is a lame insult, and pointing that out just makes them use other unimaginative words.

I guess my tldr is this: misogyny is bad, but being aggressive over words used on the Internet is not going to cure it. Telling people to stop using an offensive word just tells them that using it is working by making people upset, just like they want."

"Done beautifully as always by the Queen, and the whole BABYMETAL organization. This is why I still believe Su, Moa, Koba, and the Kami's are all destined for continued success and greatness. I will follow them until the end of my life - like I do with a handful of other bands I love.

On another note - regarding some discussion about whether the BM staff views this subreddit, frankly, I would be embarrassed if they did so. I think positive feedback is always a plus, and sometimes you have to look at hate and learn from that too. But for them to see this fractured community here - embarrasses me. Some folks are OK here, and I have learned alot from many people here. But alas, there are too many fair weather fans here for me just basically shit-posting without facts, good quality pictures, etc.. I will most likely enjoy BABYMETAL's future success elsewhere, as I can no longer tolerate this community as a whole. There will be no responses given."

"/me enters tarven in every town

did you hear the story of Carolus Rex, the master rogue, he defeated an elder lich in a card game!, the clever dastard, played a game of 3 card monte with a deck of many things, forcing the lich to draw an unfortunate card in his choice.

The smartest, quickest of wit, the greatest rogue there ever was... was sadly consumed by his deadly game, as the fates bound them with an alignment swap, now there is an heroic lich going around saving people...and the unknown hero who saved the world, slaughtering men and monsters, nations and gods by the many...and so I tell this story, for the hero who gave it all up, to save people like me and you.

10 sessions later... I wouldn't threaten me, don't you know my name? /disguise self... Carolus Rex, bend the knee or die, forfeit your soul to my apatite, and have your mourners at your funeral slain, thusly no one will be left living who will even know you had ever been...

601 Canadian men with testicular cancer and 744 population-based controls were used to assess diet risk with testicular cancer. Of 17 food groups (along with 15 nutrients), high dairy intake was found to be the biggest risk factor in testicular cancer, especially cheese. Of nutrients, dietary calcium was consistently associated with increased risk of cancer in the non-seminoma group. High intake of fruits and vegetables were found to offer no protection in the high-risk diets.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22190107](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22190107)

Daily milk consumption in adolescence (vs. less than daily), but not in  midlife or currently, was associated with a 3.2-fold risk of advanced  prostate cancer (95% CI: 1.25, 8.28). These data suggest that frequent  milk intake in adolescence increases risk of advanced prostate cancer.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11857417](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11857417)

The incidence and mortality rates of testicular and prostatic cancers in  42 countries were correlated with the dietary practices in these  countries using the cancer rates (1988-92) provided by the International  Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the food supply data (1961-90)  provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Among the food  items we examined, cheese was most closely correlated with the  incidence of testicular cancer at ages 20-39, followed by animal fats  and milk. The correlation coefficient (r) was highest (r = 0.804) when  calculated for cheese consumed during the period 1961-65 (maternal or  prepubertal consumption).

&amp;#x200B;

I think we should lay off feeding dairy to kids since childhood seems to be the absolute worst time to consume it. I wish I was told about the risks and given the choice when I was young.

"\&gt;And the surface line is a lot more than PCs

Not sure what you mean (peripherals?).   But the first article notes that IDC counts Chromebooks as PC's but not 2-in-1's like the Pro/Book/Go, and Gartner does the reverse (which makes more sense) which is why their numbers are higher.

So Surface revenue growth is much higher/faster than the whole PC market, though the ""traditional business PC"" is also contributing strongly to growth:

Desktops and tablets (iPads, presumeably) are losing market share while laptops are gaining slightly.

I didnt know how terrible the abortion culture is in America. Where I come from its considered a right. If you want an abortion you have to be a 100% sure of it and if you're not, they wont let you get through it. You tell your closes friends and family about it, because you need support and it sucks. They probably will be supportive. 

I dont think abortion should be as restricted as you say it would have to be. If there are persons willing to coat hanger themselve, then clearly there is something wrong with the system. 
Maybe whay you're looking for is something like alowing the earlier forms of abortion. The kind you just discribed is only done when the baby's to big (17-24 weeks old). The reason its done till the baby is 24 weeks is because the nervus system is not able to sense pain till that time. 

So yeah, baby dead, cut up and all. But didn't feel anything. It wasn't even really alive yet.

What he needs to get him off varies so I look for/listen to his cues. But primarily it's hard suction while stroking with one or both hands.  I use long strokes from the base to the head (or close anyway because I'm trying to maintain suction as much as possible at the same time) 

Sometimes I use a motion like using a pepper grinder, really slow like. That often takes him over the edge."

"&gt;best possible explanation for existence

How do you know this? How did you arrive at this conclusion?

&gt;no reason for belief in the unknown

That is correct, because how can you believe in something that is unknowable? Even theists would agree with this, because they claim to “know” about a god of some kind, which means that god is technically speaking no longer in the category of “unknowable things”.

Your metaphor of the room is also flawed, because we have examples of rooms being constructed and designed. We have no examples of universes being constructed or designed to compare our universe to, so this example doesn’t work. Also, in this example you assume that it’s even possible to look outside the room. Currently, it is not possible to actually look outside our universe, we can only observe what is in the universe and make educated guesses about what could possibly be outside it.

The rest of your argument sort of turns into Rampling about goodness and things being easier to destroy than create, but all of that is a subjective call based on your personal biases and experiences. So it’s less of an argument and more of an assertion on your part, that is not backed up by any sort of facts. (Unless you start getting into entropy, which is another subject in my estimation)"
"&gt; cant you just copy and paste valves post

Most of the times there isn't one. And even when there is, not every change is documented.

&gt; is it really like a full time job

It's not. But when people expect it of you, it starts to feel like one. And the longer they expect, the stronger it feels like a full time job.

&gt; if you dont post it im sure someone else would or atleast we could all go to valves website and just read ourselves

They wouldn't. For many reasons.

1. Like I said, there aren't change patch notes most of the time.
2. Even if someone can diff through the changes, there is a difference between seeing a change and knowing what it means.
3. To know what a change means, you need to have a good understanding of how the Dota 2 system works .. and that can take a while to learn it well enough to do it.
4. Once you know what a change means, you need to have the patience to neatly format it and explain things for the layman.
5. Last but not the least .. they'd do it once .. twice.. thrice. I've done it for well over a thousand (literally) patches over 6 years. So time and dedication I'd say is something not everyone might be willing to put in.

Aery and Comet are acceptable choices on him, yet Predator is great - in the early game, your ult is mostly gonna be a ""Let me finish that low health target"" and not ""I'll just up my damage by 5k by pressing one button"", and Predator is extremely useful for that since it'll always go on the lowest target. It boosts your execute range by a lot and its cooldown is pretty much the same as that of your ult. 

Later on in the game, it makes your ult go from ""I'll poke squishies down from 100% to 40% of their health"" to ""You have 80% of your health as an ADC without defensive stats? Git gud and get that grey screen"". 

Besides, Predator allows you to get Ultimate Hunter while still having Last Stand and Presence of Mind. "

"The GOO Warlock is the most Lovecraft-inspired D&amp;D subclass. A GOO patron is something like Cthulhu. A GOO Warlock has probably tapped into the power of some cosmic horror that may not even know the Warlock exists.

I liked my friend’s analogy. When I eat lunch, I leave crumbs. If a solitary ant comes along and rolls a crumb home, I’ll probably never notice. The ant probably isn’t even able to perceive me properly because I’m so big, powerful, and alien to the ant. But if that ant could tell stories and think about the world, it wouldn’t be a surprise if it decided that crumb was a gift from some powerful god. Maybe it returns and does a ceremony to beseech the god for more food. Maybe the god “answers” by delivering more food.

The GOO can be me eating lunch and your Warlock can be the ant. It doesn’t have to be like that, but it works for the GOO and is distinct from a D&amp;D cleric or most other Warlock’s relation to their gods/patrons. With all that in mind, the powers start to make more sense. They tend to be ominous and relate to warping and manipulating minds and the fabric of reality as the Warlock taps into the power of this horrific, cosmic entity."

"Wow you hit the nail on the head.  You're especially right about the protagonist kid's anti-arc? and just how uncomfortable the scenes with the women in the village is.  It seems like just about every scene contradicts itself.  

When they first entered (force their way into) the house of the women I thought to myself, Jesus, how would I feel watching this in the theater?  It starts with BPitt and kid breaking into a flat and practically raping these women, then in a bizarre quick turn of events BPitt makes himself comfortable and shows the lady some eggs: understandably all the tension and rapey vibes go away.  It builds a good 3 or 4 minutes of uncomfortable wtf-ness than in the span of about 10 seconds completely turns around and the women are won over.  W.T.F.  Things are going well so the douches come in and make everything uncomfortable again?  WHY?  What is with this constantly fluctuating tone?

The whole movie builds on the kid becoming one of the crew then poops the bed with the aforementioned German letting him live.  The only German that actually lived because of kid not shooting was the road side bomber near the beginning of the film and because of that one of their tank crews was killed -- to me that's the movie saying 'not killing = bad'.  If he let a German live at SOME POINT in the movie you might be able to ring this one back as good karma; but he never does.  The message they hammer into you is war is brutal and you need to be brutal to survive.  There was no message of mercy or redemption it was all KILL KILL KILL which made the ending completely baffling."

Most people don't have extensive education in world history and I think the lack of a clear example the average person can point to for a tolerant majority Muslim society causes a knee jerk reaction to conflate Islam with those societies. For Christianity I think most people can name multiple ""Christian"" counties, quotes because most are no longer strictly Christian, that are tolerant of other religions and do not rely on scripture for authority when enacting brutal laws. One could make the argument that it is a societal failing, not a failing of Islam itself that leads to the differences, but the religions are easy things to point to for the average person to explain the differences, hence why Christianity is treated differently than Islam despite the Old Testiment having questionable passages.

"I actually can totally relate to this. I have stuff at work I have to lift closer to like 50 lbs and it used to bother the crap out of me that I couldn't. So I fixed it.

Let's things about the movements necessary here (and feel free to correct me if I get them wrong).

You want to lift an object (assuming off the ground), up to chest level, then push up to get it above your head?

So the lifting from the ground is super easy to train. Deadlifts and their variations would be your friend here. Of course squats won't hurt either, but the deadlift is activating the back and gripping muscles in your arms which is what's allowing you to actually grasp, hold, and lift the object. Your legs are moving your body up while your upper body holds on.

To get from here to chest level, there are a couple options. You could do an upright row and target your back a little more or you could do a front raise and target your shoulders. Your large back muscles are going to be stronger and therefore this is probably the easier way to go. 

From here, it becomes chest, tris, and shoulders (i.e. your pushing muscles). At this point, you're taking the weight and pushing it up and away from you. Front raises come in again as well as bench press and it's variations. Definitely throw in OHP press, probably standing because you want to mimic your desired movement. Another one that helped me a TON was to grab a plate and press it hard between my palms. I held the plate close to my chest and then pressed outward. It took a little to get the mind muscle connection on that one but once I did... 👍💪"

"Hi there!

I can only speak from personal experience as a previous student who went through his course. 

It really depends on what you are looking for and what your current situation is. 

I was financially stable before I came into the program so $2,500 was relatively cheap for me. 

The reason I decided to join HTC was to acquire a high income skill so that I can spend less time working and more time with my family. I made great money but was unable to spend it with my family and I knew that things were going to continue that way unless I did something different. 

The course gave me the necessary mindset and resource to become successful. After graduating from the course I secured an influencer and have netted $13,000 (two month) into my pocket. Let me also share with you that I do not come from any sales background and just the thought of speaking to strangers freaks me out. My goal is to quit my day job by next year and pursue closing fulltime. 

In addition to my own personal growth, you will also network with some really high rollers that will help pull you up. I have also seen people who were broke and invested fully into the program and are now making 6-7k/month. Just to be clear, the program says that you can make up to 10k/month but most likely not get there starting off. However, would you still be happy with making 6-7k/month starting off working only 4-5 hrs a day? 

If you have any additional question, please feel free to reach out to me via Facebook and I will do my best to answer them. Thank you."

That will show that you are informed, but not trying to compare yourself to another specific employee. It'll also let your boss know you probably looked at job offers, to know the salaries. Personally if I were your boss and you went that route and explained why you're a good asset and a raise can help you be an even better one, I'd be inclined to raise you; if you mentioned someone else's salary, I know for me, you'd be a red flag that I'd probably give as little raise as possible.

"According to Merriam-Webster, ""Zionism"" is ""an international movement originally for the establishment of a Jewish national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of modern Israel.""  You are taking that definition, particularly the ""support for modern Israel"" bit and stretching it to mean ""support for a movement whereby Israel has an absolute right to run its country, without reproach or criticism, including by means of cruel oppression and ethnic cleansing."" This is not part of being Jewish. Not by any means.  There is nothing inherent in being Jewish that requires such oppression and violence. Therefore, criticism of this mentality is not anti-Semitic, it is anti-apartheid.  If you cannot see this, you are trying to talk yourself into something that is not there.

I think it can be hard it school because you lose focus of what OT really is. You get caught up in the technical stuff the goni, transfers, splints and see them as assessments/grades to pass and not their purpose. I know you're busy with school but it might be beneficial/therapeutic to remember back to your shadowing time and how these skills were used/if they were used. If you have time it might be helpful to see if you can shadow an OT on a weekend or something to ground you.  


Also, want to second Azen's point about talking out loud. I think this is a great study tool, but also something that I do frequently when working with patients. I find that explaining exactly what I'm going to do for transfers is a great way to reassure the patient and remind myself what to do, along with continued patient education.

"&gt; Sure, which is why I say that the exact point of consciousness is what we need to determine with regards to abortions. That is the middle point that I'm largely referring to. At what point the fetus go from ""a clump of cells"" into ""a baby"".

I doubt there is a point, it's probably a process that starts with the formation of the first neurons (which, IIRC happens during the embryo stage) until probably some months after language is mastered. Of course, I'm not a biologist, so this is completely uninformed opinion. But in general, biology doesn't work through concrete points, it's usually a gradual process, so why should this be any different?

&gt; Which is what most abortions are (as in, the body doing so naturally). A fetus cannot survive outside of the mother's body until it is developed to a particular point. That, too, is a similar middle-point regarding when it is and is not acceptable to abort.

Well, no. In an abortion, someone takes action (ie, ingest certain drugs or perform something into the woman's uterus) to make the human die. In the event of disconnecting someone with brain death, someone has to take action to keep the person alive (ie, connect it to the medical equipment) if keeping that person alive is at all possible.

Suppose I find a bleeding dog in the street. If I do nothing, the dog will continue to bleed until brain death happens and, at that point, agony becomes irreversible. That's letting the dog die. If, however, the dog is fine but I grab him and put it in an environment where he'll die (like Laika), I'm not ""letting the dog die"" - I'm killing the dog. Laika, for instance, wasn't ""left to die"". She was intentionally put to death."

You can't leave and find a comparable paying job because you don't have a degree.  
You have no leverage.

Companies don't just give you raises because they think you do a good job, they give you raises because they think you do a good job and don't want you to leave.

You can't leave anyway. So what would be the point in giving you a raise?

The initial raises were probably just enough to ensure you couldn't leave and find a comparable salary."
" I have several favorites. 2012 Pendleton event (swim, bike, run at Camp Pendleton)- that truly had the most element of surprise of any CrossFit event because it was the first time the games started earlier in the week when we were all expecting it to start on Friday.

One of my favorite memories is starting the run in a tight pack and then pulling away with Julie Foucher, we pushed each other through most of the run until she hit the jets! Another favorite was the legless rope climb event at the games in 2013. I got 2nd place in the event which put me in first overall at the end of Friday. It was the only time in my career that I got to go to bed and wake up in first place at the CrossFit Games! I ended up in 7th overall that year."

But might examine your finances, freeze interest and say ""J Smith you've to pay $10 a week"" or whatever you can afford.   It's not ideal.

Look on Amazon

Edit:  just took a closer look.  I would chisel the mdf out completely to just above and below the damaged area.  Make nice squared off cuts. Be careful not to further damage the plastic window frame or the wood casing.  Then use construction adhesive to attach a piece of scrap wood just smaller than the area you chiseled out. Build up to the final profile with the Quickwood, or even wood filler if the scrap fit good.   Use wood filler on the gouges on the casing. Sand smooth, paint, profit. "

"Slashers are one of the three types of lycanthropes, victims of a contagious mental illness that fucks up their perception of morality and spreads through fascination. 

There's two possibilities for your disembodied supernatural beings, ""creepypasta"" types, and other one-of-a-kind monsters: they're either wights, or symptoms of a haunting. 

Significant (usually tragic) events have been known to leave psychic scars in places and objects. These scars that cause magical phenomena to manifest that mirror the event in question. Hauntings are by nature hard to generalize, as each one is dependent on local folklore. The events of *Nightmare on Elm Street* fit the description of a haunting - serial killer gets caught, a rumor starts that he can hunt you down in your dreams, and as a result the neighborhood starts to lash out at sleeping teens. 


Wights, on the other hand, are people who got preternatural abilities thanks to their reputation. Wights generally have strict behavioral limitations that they're forced to follow, also determined by their image. The thing from *It Follows* is a good example of what a wight might look like - supernatural durability, selective invisibility, and apparent immortality... but there's a hard logic behind who it's allowed to pursue, who can see it, and it needs to fucking walk everywhere goes. 

Instead of reputation, you can also develop supernatural abilities through ""confidence"" by completely mastering mundane skills. This is most often seen in older vampires - if you spend decades killing, you'll probably pick up a few tricks along the way. 

As for how humans don't get wiped out, it's admittedly a tough existence but we're really good at findings ways to adapt. Especially since magic is intertwined with symbolism and belief, so there's plenty of little magical tools to help knowledgeable individuals put down most threats.

Also, voltaics (artificial lifeforms, both biological *Frankenstein*-types and robotic mechs) have been instrumental in humanity's endemic war against the creatures of the night."

STARDUST: So much crystals on these mid sized nugs, I love it! Strong berry and skunk aroma and smooth tasty smoke. Great body buzz, was uplifting yet relaxing and this was definitely my fav out of the 4 strains I got. Recommend for daytime for a social gathering.

ICE CREAM: Love the smell on this strain, literally sweet like ice cream! Sticky, dense and frosty mid sized nugs. Smooth on the smoke and was pretty good high, nice relaxed, euphoric feel to it. Pretty nice for daytime use for sure.

"&gt;You are either trolling or you are completely clueless.

Pure projection

&gt;Your points are all invalid in your follow up response.

Just because you wish that were the case?  You failed to rebut any of my points or evidence.

&gt;The whole argument for the planner being back home was that the boyfriend had access to the car at some point after she was murdered. He was already confirmed to be living at her home after her death. This was already addressed in the documentary.

After she was reported missing he stayed with Bloedorne as they did searching etc. That fails to mean a thing so far as the planner page.

You have no explanation for why she would take a sheet of paper with her to do any appointments and no evidence of any kind she had any appointments to do. You have no evidence she left her house until after 12:50.  You have nothing and keep ignoring this...

&gt;The clients don’t pay the photographer until she shows up. This. Again. Has nothing to do with Auto trader being involved. They don’t pay in advance which is why Teresa showed up to SA’s trailer and took the money and gave him the magazine and left. It doesn’t work in reverse like it does in your imagination. The clients didn’t contact AT and then they gave them Teresa’s number. They already had her cell number. You’re entire argument for this point is “why didn’t anyone say anything” when this is a strong question asked about the ex boyfriend not reporting her missing after 3 days of being MIA.

How does this rebut my points?  You are making the allegations she did appointments from 9-1 collecting all sorts of money from people to run AT ads and then are saying that these people would not have called AT to complain about their ads not being run... 

Her phone records were investigated to see who she spoke to leading up to her murder and no hustle shots were arranged other than Speckman.  So once again you want to pretend appointments were scheduled that had not been...

Hillegas was her exboyfriend from highschool he was not a recent ex and he didn't see her much so why would he notice her missing?   What relevance is this to any of the points made in this thread anyway about Halbach having no reason to take the sheet of paper with her in her car, not leaving her house until after 12:50...

&gt;Your cell tower knowledge is lacking by quite a bit so you should stop trying to address it as if a quick google search is going to help you understand the full concept.

It is your understanding that is totally lacking. The cell tower connected to has to be in range of the phone. The maximum range of GSM towers is 20 miles. The tower connected to was way more than 20 miles away from Sheboygan.  She used her landline while Zellner claims she was in Sheboygan- you refuse to address how she could be in 2 places at once.  

&gt;Trying to dismiss everything because of your lack of knowledge or lack of understanding is quite laughable. Keep arguing and trying to challenge everyone who disagrees with you when you are asking questions about topics that have already been clearly addressed. If you would have done the correct research you wouldn’t be asking questions that have already been answered.

It is you who has a total lack of understanding and dismisses everything you can't comprehend even something so simple as the fact that Halbach was using her home phone the same exact time Zellner claims she was doing appointments that didn't even exist...

You failed to address any of my arguments all you did was deflect..."

"Thank you so much for this well written reply--  Yes we didn't realize the colors were off until viewing from the side in very florescent light.  Band is rose gold and the head is yellow gold--  I think each time I want to think and trust its perfect due to my lack of knowledge and their professional ability but these issues pop up later...

For the 4 prong, It was my request-- I see your point and would have reconsidered but they didn't point to any issues at the time.  I know my SO's ideal set up is the 4 prong--  I will get opinion if it was the wrong setting.

The polishing job is almost a relief.  I'm pretty sure I originally paid for Gold (albeit 10k gold), while when I got it repaired they never discussed changing the metal so I assumed the head would STAY the original material... Originally I brought them a ring that had two small of gold prongs so they at least were able to cut and keep that small amount.  I know the jeweler was on vacation part of the time he had it, and kept saying he was waiting on a mount.   Perhaps he rushed this mount and that's why it's not proper size or color?

For the cleaning-- it seems like when it came back the white sapphire's on the band were cloudier.  We cleaned with drop of soap in water and it got a bit better, but still seemed dirtier then before fix, but perhaps jeweler didn't clean at all?  By cleanup did you mean needs cleaned with soap and water, or cleaned up with industrial heat and materials to remove oxidation and porosity?"

"Im referring to the shouting down of public protest, and doxxing. Its everywhere on college campuses and doxing was very popular during the “unite the right” rallies. This is a strategy commonly used by antifa, and other far left groups. 
However, doxxing seems to be a party wide strategy. Predominantly on republican figures, they also use global internet platforms to close down republicans as well. I.e: alex jones. 

This also includes physical assault of republicans as well. Where the democratic party would constantly physically assault the right, almost to no effect.

Realistically, listening to one another will never work. Neither party would let that happen. With radicals on each side and others firm in their beliefs, there will never be national unity unless it is under a single party. And i believe it will slowly shift towards republican domination."

"**Tom Waits**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/e6928364a1584e76ad63e88df481aafd.png)  

&gt; Tom Waits (born Thomas Alan Waits, in Pomona, California, on December 7, 1949) is a prolific American singer, songwriter, composer, and actor.

&gt; He started his career in the early 1970s as a singer in spit 'n' sawdust bars. Initially, he was deeply influenced by the beat generation, novelists like Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, and poets like Allen Ginsberg and Charles Bukowski.  Waits is often compared to Charles Bukowski, being similar both in content and lifestyle

&gt; Waits was unable to make a living from his music in the 70s because his classical bar music, based in pre-rock, and Americana, blues, and Vaudeville styles were not popular.  Waits's voice back then was soft, warm and clear. 

&gt; Waits subsequently developed a devoted cult following and has influenced subsequent songwriters, despite having little radio or music video support. In fact, his songs are perhaps best known to the general public in the form of cover versions of more visible artists, such as the Eagles, Bruce Springsteen and Rod Stewart. 

&gt; Although Waits’s albums have met with mixed commercial success in his native United States, they have occasionally achieved gold album sales status in other countries.

&gt; Lyrically, Waits's songs are known for atmospheric portrayals of seedy characters and places; he sings about the losers on the streets: alcoholics, junkies, prostitutes and social outcasts, although he also includes more conventional and touching ballads in his repertoire.  

&gt; While opening for Frank Zappa, the audience catcalled and refused to listen to him; he was an unsuitable match with Zappa's avantgarde style. 

&gt; Countless cigarettes, gallons of alcohol and many  all night parties eventually left their trace in his face and voice.

&gt; His more recent gravelly voice can be first heard on Small Change. This distinctive voice turned out to be his trademark. It is described by the Music Hound Rock Album Guide as sounding ""like it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months and then taken outside and run over with a car"". Small Change with its sentimental ballads, its bar-jazz attitude and Film Noir-oriented stories turned out to be his biggest commercial success in the 1970s. 

&gt; Waits subsequently developed a more unique style. His songs have grown more abrasive since then, and the arrangements have turned more surreal and experimental with every new record.  His life brings him to new visions, as indicated by the direction taken in his ""Alice"" release.

&gt; While composing the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's One From The Heart Waits met Kathleen Brennan, his bride-to-be. They married in 1980 and she helped him quit drinking and smoking.  Since their marriage they have been working together on his albums as co-producers and co-writers. It is hard to say which part belongs to her and which to him, but it's easy to see that they make a perfect team.  Additionally, his eldest son Casey can be heard on turntables and percussion on Waits's album ""Real Gone"".

&gt; One of Waits's greatest successes was the album ""Swordfishtrombones"", released in 1983. It struck with his critics and fans alike. He achieved a new level of song writing and left former conventions (and his earlier career) behind. All songs, whether ballads, jive or jazz are played in a completely different way. It seems that Waits had taken the musical archetypes of these styles and made them his own. All tracks are in the quintessential Waits style. They have a striking rawness and listenability and they set the stage for his success and his future career. 

&gt; The Bad As Me Songfacts reports that 36 years after the release of Waits' first album, Closing Time in 1973, Bad As Me became Waits's first ever top 10 album in the US when it debuted at #6 with 63,000 sales. 

&gt; In the late 1980s Waits discovered an outlet for his creativity in composing musicals. His first Musical was named ""The Black Rider"", and is based on ""Der Freischütz"" by Carl Maria von Weber. It was co-produced by Robert Wilson and the lyrics come from William S. Burroughs. The story is slightly reminiscent of Kurt Weil's and Berthold Brecht's ""Three Penny Opera"" and the 1930s. The debut performance of the play was in 1990 at the Thalia Theater, Hamburg and has been played by various theatre groups since then.

&gt; Waits was also responsible for two other musicals, which later became albums released simultaneously in 2002. One was the musical ""Blood Money,"" which covers the ""Woyczek"" theme of Georg Büchner. This one is one of the darkest works from Waits. The other musical is based on Lewis Carroll's classic children's novel, ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". ""Alice"" is very romantic, dreamy and soft, and contains one of Waits most romantic songs. Even though they were released at the same time, the bootlegs of the ""Alice"" musical were long before traded between fans and were just rearranged and re-mastered for the official release.

&gt; Besides many film contributions as composer – the Internet Movie Database imdb.com lists 47 appearances of Waits as composer and 38 soundtracks containing songs by Waits - he also is an actor with a total of 25 appearances, ranging from some mini-roles as a trumpeter in ""Heart of Saturday Night"" and the R. M. Renfield in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" to the major role of Zack in Jim Jarmusch's ""Down by Law"". He recently appeared in Roberto Benigni's ""The Tiger and the Snow"", playing You Can Never Hold Back Spring at Benigni's wedding dream.  Even more recently, Waits played Mr.Nick (the Devil) in Terry Gilliam's ""The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus"".

&gt; In addition to a number of concert videos, he also appeared in the critically-acclaimed concert feature film ""Big Time"" (1990).

&gt; Waits has always refused to allow the use of his songs in commercials. He has filed several lawsuits against advertisers for using his material without permission. Waits also successfully sued an advertiser for using a work that was stylistically similar to his work, after he had declined to sell them the rights to his song. He has been quoted as saying, ""Apparently the highest compliment our culture grants artists nowadays is to be in an ad — ideally naked and purring on the hood of a new car.  I have adamantly and repeatedly refused this dubious honor.""

"I think I have to attribute starting off on the piano with my Uncle. He was a ""dabble here and there"" kind of musician who would grab little things like a lap held electric drum pad or something to mess around with in his spare time. I'm pretty sure he sat me down one day and was just like 'Hey see this, this is fun, try and see what you can do!"" As that's how he would grab our attention for something he was passionate for.

I started on piano around 8 or 9 years old. 

In middle school my twin decided to join orchestra so I joined to. I took up the cello, and played that for the next four years even getting into advanced orchestra although it wasn't really that advanced.

In high school during the three years of cello, my twin picked up the guitar and bass guitar which I essentially took over from her as her interest quickly fizzled out.

And also during high school I fell in love with the drums and my mom bought me a little cheap 300 dollar set.

So that makes five so far...piano, cello, bass, guitar, and drums.

The only instrument out of the 5 that I didn't teach myself was the cello. The learning process for the piano was using the prerecording songs that had lights on the keys for finger placement. It was a reallly nice Yamaha keyboard that had lessons you could do to learn the built in songs for either just the left hand, or the right hand, or both together. You could fast forward or rewind certain parts you struggled with and the notes would light up to show you were the notes were on the scale. That's how I started to learn piano, and how I learned all the songs I learned there after.

The cello, like I said, I was taught by a teacher for four years. 

The drums I initially just started banging on, finding sounds I liked, then I realized well hey cello has sheet music drums should have some too. So I started learning how to read drum tab and learned how to play some of my favorite songs that way.

With the guitar I went straight to reading the music, though I learned the really simple version of guitar music, called guitar tab, rather than actual sheet music, as the I only ever learned bass sheet music when I was learning the cello(since it's a bass instrument).

Bass guitar was my least played instrument, but I consider it learned since it's pretty much a lower key off shoot of the guitar, and I had a technical understanding of it.

Being in orchestra my inspiration for Cello was like Bach and the other classical artists, can't remember any of them now, lol. My inspiration for drums, guitar, and bass were my favorite rock bands...think Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day and Blur. And for piano, I didn't have any inspiration for that other than the songs that came prerecorded on it that I wanted to learn, and I think there was like 100 of them or something around about there.

I adore music, but now at 27 I haven't played anything in two years and the only thing that's stuck around this long has been the SAME Yamaha from when I was 8 and my guitars."

"In need of a new rear wheel. Run Deep V upfront but want something lighter in the back. Why? I feel my bike is a tad too heavy. Budget is $400 or less. I looked at all the usual suspects, mostly wheels like Miche Pistard, Wabi superlight, Ellipse, Formation, Archetype, KinLin, etc. I then started looking into carbon. 

Basically I'd like some suggestions of stuff i missed or any advice on carbon as i don't know much. Just ""discovered"" Reynolds Recons so I'm a noob. 

Either way, must be clincher. Really prefer sealed bearings, and kind of want to be able to use my Surley lockring but threading is not a deal breaker. Also a brake pad will never touch this wheel. 

Thanks for the suggestions

EDIT: Apparently carbon is waaaay out of my budget, so I guess any rear wheel suggestions other then the ones listed above. I am 220lbs and ride like a Clydesdale on DC's shitty streets. Deep Vs have served me well, just wanting something lighter if possible. Otherwise, I may just get another Deep V. "

"That's just a matter of making some assumptions. What kind of lifestyle do you want to have in retirement and how much do you think you'll need to withdraw from savings to live it? You'll likely own your house, so housing costs might be able to be safely removed from the equation, so is that future tax bracket likely low enough that deferring taxes on the top portion of your income now is worth it?

It's a fairly safe bet that tax rates will go up in the future, so the more you make now, the closer you get to the point where a Roth is no longer your best option."

"[here](http://galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html) 

I’m sure a lot of us have read it but..

Anyway. It’s interesting to me because we could be wrong about..well..everything in the world. God, our understanding of the world, it’s laws and anything else could just all be wrong.

When I get stuck in my head thinking about these things I sort of come back to the thought the universe as we understand it and even our world just has too much order for some greater power to not make sense. 

I think “finding god/being saved” is just when you come to terms with yourself and know that you have not reached your full potential. There is so much more to us than we know of. But it also means that we realize there has to be something greater than ourselves.

One reason I believe this is just because look at us. We are the most adaptive creatures on the planet with brains that can find ways to make sense of almost anything. But at the same time those same brains can be fooled.

We can convince ourselves of literally anything. No matter how right or wrong. We can convince ourselves that anything is true.

Our minds and bodies and abilities are so mysterious. We think we understand them but we may have only reached the surface. 

To a similar note what is beyond our universe? What about beyond that? And beyond that?

Saying “the universe doesn’t end” is one thing but really think about that and it should be unsettling. How can something never end? What does that mean? The universe is a physical thing. It’s a place of existence. How can it not have an end? If it does then what’s at the end?

"Leave it be. He’s apologized and has agreed to leave the game at home. There is no red flag here - in fact, he sounds like a pretty good guy for realizing his mistake and apologizing and moving on.

My opinion may be unpopular, but... I can see why he reacted the way he did if he’s anything like me. 1. I like video games and I get excited about new ones that are about to come out (I’ve preordered RDR). 2. Most importantly, I need some “me” time every day. I can be completely in love with my girlfriend, but if I don’t have at least an hour to myself for the day, I’m not going to be very happy. Some people just need that time to themselves to do what *they* want to do - alone. In your defense, I totally understand that you *both* want to play it, but there’s only one TV, and nobody wants to watch someone play through a game that you’re eager to play through. It ruins the first time experience for you.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/eb40a62777d64a1783988c4afa641821.png)  

&gt; In the summer of 2005, after a series of deaths in the family, Michael Deni left his hometown in New Jersey for San Francisco. He spent the next several months with his guitar and a synthesizer, turning that tragedy into the songs that would soon become the foundation for Geographer.

&gt; With the additions of cellist Nathan Blaz and drummer Brian Ostreicher, Geographer spent the next year cutting their teeth in the Bay Area, winning over crowds with the heart-pounding epics that make up their debut record, ‘Innocent Ghosts’.

&gt; After being selected one of three ‘Undiscovered Bands You Need To Hear Now’ by SPIN Magazine and garnering considerable word-of-mouth praise from their energetic live shows, the band signed to San Francisco-based label Tricycle Records, releasing a 7” single for the song ‘Kites’ in October 2009.

&gt; ‘Animal Shapes’ follows up ‘Kites’, building on the synth-driven aesthetic of the single, while flirting with darker, more esoteric underpinnings. The record merges Geographer’s aptitude for crafting beautiful, haunting melodies with textural sounds and poly-rhythmic energy, marking an evolution of their distinct style.

&gt; With the overwhelming response to the release of ‘Kites’ and ‘Animal Shapes’, punctuated by a dynamic and engaging live set, the band has already begun to make an indelible mark on the ears of music fans worldwide. Read more on Last.fm.

"The Divide part is splitting people up by immutable characteristics and legitimizing those as vectors to critizice and judge people on. Left wing Identity politics is pretty rampant imo (don't bring up the right I know and they are of no concern for right now).

On the surface they seek equality yet the would they would reject an egalitarian approach. Why does the CoC have the bucket list of characteristics? Unless ""everyone"" for some odd reason doesn't include people of color all of the sudden.
Everyone is to be afforded the same opportunity and courtesy regardless of characteristics (immutable or otherwise) not withstanding ability to code. Ask yourself why isn't it somehing along those lines?
Because they don't want equality they want ""representation"" and they don't want merit. Why? Because they want to in regardless of skill.

What you misunderstood is that Infiltration does not mean they  come from outside. It means that they are highly motivated activists that ""Infiltrate"" into positions of power. Unearned yet given to them because they scream loudest.

How does it work?  
The far left will decry racism in any field that has under representation of minorities and/or percieved underprivileged groups. However assuming a level playing field one would expect differences in Interests and thus varying percentages across different Fields. There are biological differences between the sexes which can in part explain imbalances. Access to education is also a big factor to consider. This may not cover all of it but a difference in outcome does not logically imply discrimination in the input.

So what they do is raise the issue of underrepresentation.  
How do they want to fix underrepresentation? Simple just hire more X in favor of Y regardless of merit. The company/project  should ""represent"" the entire population after all. 51% of humans are women and so should be our parliament, management team, community.  
A ludicrous goal since the talent pool is not split nearly 50/50.
Might that be because women are discouraged from entering the field? Maybe, but we can't fix that through discrimination now can we?

They will say ""unconscious biases"" are preventing their sucess. However while humans do have biases, if you where truly trying to remove them, you would anonymise CVs not replace them with a conscious bias. (open source projects already allow pseudonymity why do you assume your pull request is rejected because of your genitals?)

Ofc there is no hiring in FOSS but I hope you get the point. Companies where the first to fall victim to this strategy that is why I reference it.

So what is next: ""only XX% of accepted commits are by Y. Accept my shitty code because I wasn't loved as a child and feel victimized."" 

Which puts us in step 3: Regulate. Exert control through Ideological dominance, shaming and authority.

Figure out your passions and hobbies. These have to be things that keep you in the present moment. The best thing to do is to set a goal for yourself and get to it. It takes time, but once you’re immersed in something you love (I personally love doing puzzles and origami, along with rubik’s cubes) you kinda forget your problems and they eventually become rational to deal with. When you’re sitting alone it can kinda be like “damn, I have nothing going for me. I hate this life,” etc. but when you’re doing something you enjoy, you tend to be more like “ahh I have some issues in life but at least I have something fun I enjoy doing”. It then lessens the pain and you’re more likely to go and get help when things get rough. "

as far as your rambling about water and soda and stuff...that all has valid parts to it...but again, nothing to really do with the original point that sandwiches are a perfectly fine thing to by to prep for a few days.

"Keep seeing this article posted but it is an absolute misrepresentation is selective data.

From the article:

&gt; ADL’s death count includes non-ideological murders committed by extremists, i.e. gang violence or other criminal activity that does not have a political or racial motive.

-

Pretty important point don’t you think? If a skin head kills another skin head because he had an affair with his wife, then that’s right wing extremist violence in this analysis.  

-

The opposite equivalent of this would be to brand every murder committed by anyone who supports black lives matter as being included in left wing extremism violence/murders.

-

Apolitical violence committed by someone doesn’t entail violence of a group.  It has to be politically or ideologically motivated to be defined as violence by right or left wing extremists. 

-

E:  Also, are you kidding me this kind of crap??

&gt; The Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to the ADL to assess the source data behind the “74 percent” statistic, but the ADL declined to provide the data. “We did not make the full data set public,” the communications team told TheDCNF.

I can assume here that your modem is attempting to reach its typical first destination (one of your ISP's routers) and then fails, and then goes to the next best destination in its routing table. If you do more ping tests, do you consistently see ""No response from host"" as the second result after your router at 192.168.0.1 (assuming it's .1, 192.168.0.x is always a private IP address and you don't need to blank it out as it's reserved for local networks only :) )."

"I had a good post about Irony and sincerity on a subreddit that got banned. The gyst was basically that irony and sincerity both have roles but they can become unbalanced or misplaced. Irony “should” tear down shitty ideals that are too sincerely held. Sincerity should build up ideals that are worth keeping.

I was thinking about this as you were talking. Truth should be the ultimate goal of sincerity, and when say Truth is transcendent or whatever word you used, you are correct. The problem that arises is that outside of a materialistic worldview Truth isn’t as simple as an easily generalizable principle based on a scientific discovery. Truth is something real and it is transcendent, but approaches to truth differ from person to person. This isn’t to say that truth itself is relative. Truth is concrete, and we are the ones that deviate from it. Truth doesn’t necessitate the same thing for everyone. Everyone is born in a particular body, at a particular time and place, and creating a simple “truth” that encompasses the myriad of differences between people is unbelievably difficult. We have free will and can choose to deviate from “our truth”. So, even if someone has a good idea of what The Truth is, they can still choose to move away from it. “Free love” , “world peace” and other generalities fail to encapsulate what is actually true. 

Now is where I get into explicitly Christian stuff. In order for someone to truly show us The Truth, they would have to be The Truth that leads us back to The Truth. They would have to be the Way, The Truth and The Life. In coming to show us the Truth, The Truth would be not only confronted by Ironists, and non believers, but also by those that were convinced that they knew and were the authority on The Truth. He warned us about false prophets, and those that claim they know. He showed us that the most prized among us are those that know that they have deviated and are willing to admit it. So, irony is useful against those that are sincere about untruth. 

A lot of this is paraphrasing Kierkegaard. You should check out Fear and Trembling and Philisophical Fragments if you are interested in a more coherent explanation. You should also read the Bible "

"Krishna is most certainly an avatar of Lord Vishnu per Hindu scripture (Mahabharata and Bhagvad Purana). Krishna is actually probably the most commonly worshipped roop (form) of God today, with Ram Ji being the second (this sentence is an estimate though if data were available I’m beyond certain it is true). There is even a sect of Hinduism that is known as ISKCON - international society of Krishna consciousness.

The Vedas were first documented around the timeline you mentioned, but were passed down for multitudes of generations orally. It’s interesting to note that the preservation of this knowledge was very intense and strict memorization was required by the sages. There are even prayers for forgiveness of grammatical errors to be made after recitation of scripture. The scriptures themselves make references to dates of significant events/births/deaths/etc. based on star positioning and can be used to estimate the timing of the actual events. Using these calculations, the dates referenced are literally 10,000 years ago.

Speaking more generally, it is not by accident that present day humanity has concluded this is the oldest religion. That isn’t to take away from your faith in any way - people worship different religions all the time... the only thing that really matters is your love for God and the way you connect to Him/Her/Them/It/etc"

About the error: A .dll missing is a quite common error and reinstalling the wallet may in fact fix it, unless the error originates from a hardware failure making parts of your harddisk unreadable.

Either way, if reinstall doesn't help, try some other wallet and if that still doesn't help, latest when you get a new harddisk you'll be fine and under no circumstances will you lose any coins, as long as you have your private key."

"I know we have enough CG gameplay, but this is more a tribute to Dungeons, what I think are currently the best part of the game. 

0 obligation to do them. The rewards are great, but not game changing. They’ve done a good job with minor improvements each iteration. And best of all, it’s a fun, challenging piece of content, IF you want it to be. The nodes require strategy. It rewards you for having a wide roster. Especially with synergies teams. You can use champs you wouldn’t normally bring to AW or to try out for little risk. My 5/50 champions get to breathe again. 

As for the fight, it was dungeon 7.4. I’m not the best CG player and he was only 3/45 with two charges. I kept praying for IMIW for the third charge and fighting Kang instead! Anyway, power reserve was one of the nodes, and that plus my boosts (like I said, not the best and my partner was using 5/65 blade so I needed to keep up) made this one of the most satisfying kills in a fast and furious match up. 

Please keep the dungeons coming back! I’d love to see a leaderboard or something for each iteration! For the pair or top pairs that can get the farthest in each dungeon? Maybe bonus artifacts too! "

"I believe the serving size on canned beans includes the liquid. It's a bit of a pain, but here's what I do:

* Divide weight A by the serving size weight, which tells me how many servings are in the can
* Rinse the beans and weigh them (weight B)
* Divide weight B by the number of servings I calculated (my final drained weight)

This is the drained weight per serving. So if the serving size is 100g but my drained weight is 75g, I weigh out 75g of my drained beans and count this as one full serving. I hope this makes sense!

 The Xbox is a very powerful console, using not so foreign technology and having a structure similar to that of a PC. The fact it also uses DirectX(hence the name Xbox) means that video apps on it are generally great, but here's the catch: whenever you really try to play any videos with a high bitrate, or a resolution above 1080p, it chugs. hard. Now, that's on a 733 MHz Pentium III, and a 233 MHz N2VA.

The iPhone 4 has a 1 *G*Hz(underclocked to 800MHz) Processor, meaning it's obviously capable of more powerful stuff. as for it's GPU, I don't know.

The vita on the otherhand, has a standard clock speed of 333MHz(default) and can go up to 500MHz. It's weaker than both. It may not seem like much, but the difference is quite huge."

I offered him a lift home so we could talk a bit. 30 minute drive. When I asked how come she wasn't there with him today (they work out 5 days a week), he asked if I knew her, I said nope, never really looked at her so don't know who it is. Then he said she's mentioned that she knows me from college. 

Not saying its true but it really could be why she's looking... if so, I feel even more sad for him now. No wonder she hides her face under a very low cap every single time.

This is not gonna end well for him :/

"So I looked up the origin of this joke and found a better version:

A Supreme Court justice, a circuit judge and a district judge go duck hunting.

A duck flies overhead and the Supreme Court justice, before he picks up his shotgun, ponders the policy implications of shooting the duck. How will the environment be affected if he shoots the duck? How will the duck-hunting business be affected if he doesn't shoot the duck? By the time he finishes, the duck has flown away.

Another duck flies overhead, and the circuit judge goes through a five-part test before pulling the trigger: He lifts the shotgun to his shoulder, he sights the duck, he measures the velocity of the duck's flight, he aims, and he shoots. And, he misses.

Finally, another duck flies by, and the district judge picks up the shotgun and shoots. The duck lands and the district judge picks it up, swings it over his shoulder and tells the other two judges to explain what he did over dinner.

"[Yes it was actually.](https://www.groundguitar.com/slash-gear/)

&gt;""This guitar was originally owned by Joe Perry whose first wife sold it in the early 80s after their divorce to a music shop in Cambridge, Massachusetts for $4,500. Billy Loosigian, who worked at the shop, bought it himself, and played until 1987 when he sold it to a guitar dealer Gerry Beaudoin. It didn’t take long before Garry sold the instrument to Eric Johnson, who played it for a bit, but after finding out that it belonged to Perry, he offered to sell the guitar to him for the same price he payed. Perry didn’t have the money at that moment, so Eric contacted a few more people interested in buying it. Among them was Slash.
Loosigian reported that the guitar had pits all over the fingerboard when he first bought it. It also had Japanese style plastic tuners and the covers were removed from the pickups. He replaced the tuners with Klusons, installed Gibson pickup covers and re-fretted the neck. The guitar remains in this state to this day.

&gt;Slash played it in “November Rain” music video and on the “Use Your Illusion” studio sessions.

&gt;This Les Paul remained with him up until 2000, despite Perry’s constant efforts to buy it back. Finally on September 10th, Slash saw a great opportunity to surprise Perry: “I kept the guitar for a long time; but I knew that Joe really loved it probably as much as I did. So I gave it to him for his birthday."""

"So two things. 

1) I think it would help if you had a better understanding of what it meant to be schizophrenic. I’m NOT saying that you should check whether you meet the criteria for this disorder, but I think you’re drawing a conclusion with distorted evidence. 

2) This is a fairly common OCD theme. I’ve gone through this myself, and yes it can be scary. While NOT easy, it would help if you simply accepted the possibility that you could indeed be schizophrenic. Trying to “figure out” whether X=Y is a compulsion, and by shutting down this compulsion but recognizing you’re having the thought will at first heighten anxiety but it will eventually diminish.

Reason I brought it up was because OP said she prefers to date within her circle of friends, the complete opposite of what my friends think, and found it creepy that a stranger would ask her out.

"USA: ~100 million dead native americans, large participants in the transatlantic slave trade that killed some 50 million innocents, countless colonial atrocities in the Philippine, ~20 million killed by US military actions post-WWII, ongoing enslavement of millions of Americans, literal concentration camps for ethnic cleansing, ongoing material support for 70% of the world's dictators, consistent violent subjugation of democracy abroad, and the hegemonic enforcement of global capitalism which killed ~1.6 billion people in the 20th century and which kills a further ~20 million every year.

USSR: less than 20 million domestically and abroad over its entire existence, despite recovering from two extremely bloody defensive wars against capitalist powers and striving to liberate post-colonial territories from the far-right dictators the colonial powers left in charge.

Post-soviet Russia: more than 20 million excess deaths from kleptocratic capitalism causing widespread famine, substandard medical care, and the overall massive collapse in living standards that came with capitalism.

Wow which of these numbers is bigger and involves multiple deliberate acts of genocide?"

"What I'd do.

Warrior of Light - Basically a better version of his original unit. And give him some DEF-as-ATK and SPR-as-ATK damage options, like Sieghart has.

Firion - I'd like to see him be a king of exploiting weaknesses and physical damage, so give him lots of masteries and killers, along with chaining moves from a couple of different families. 

Onion Knight - This will be our third OK unit between the original and OK Refia. I think to differentiate him from the other two, I'd say make him a hybrid unit. Give him two Limit Stone-fueled cooldowns that allow him to ""class change"" between Ninja (ATK-fueled special abilities) and Sage (MAG-fueled abilities)

Cecil - Magic/physical cover tank that has some support abilities and an LS-fueled cooldown that gives him access to Dark knight-themed abilities that do a lot of damage without any of the drawback DKC has as a unit.

Bartz - Another hybrid unit but more singularly focused on wind element. Also native TDW.

Terra - Damage Mage with some inspiration from T. Terra for moveset. Also I'd like to see her get some evocation gauge-building stuff to play upon her esper roots. Hoping for an outside chance of Celes, but outside of a Runic-type ability, CG Charlotte is more or less how I envisioned a 5 base Celes to actually work.

Cloud - Better multipliers on both TDH damage and abilities. Also, make his Finishing Touch wind-element, reducing wind resistance, and having Tornado frames.

Squall - Give him some fire chaining moves and some of those chains that start out single target and end AOE.

Zidane - Give him both TDW and TDH passives to reflect his ability to either dual wield daggers or use the two-handed double-bladed ""thief swords."" Make him an all purpose versatile physical chainer that can fit in with multiple families.

Tidus - TDH chainer, including a DR chaining move that reduces water resistance. 

Shantotto - I guess Livid Shantotto but better.

Vaan - I'd go with basing him on his gameplay in FF12:RW and FFTA2. So someone that can stat break while buffing the party's as well as function as an evasion tank.

Lightning - Covered.

Y'Shtola - My basic concept of her gameplay (besides being Heavensward sprite) is ""CG Fina on crack."" Just also give her some Wind, Earth, and Water-elemental attack abilities that function on SPR-as-MAG scaling,

Noctis - Keep his ""jack of all trades"" shtick his original unit has, just be better at it. Like make his flasks do magic damage with ATK-as-MAG scaling."

"I've only been playing for about a month...started when I joined a work league with some friends. We play singles cricket and 301, and doubles cricket and 501. I have a looong warmup period. Seems like I only start reliably hitting what I want to hit after 3 or 4 matches. Feels like I need to remind myself what my throw should feel like. I usually stay for a bit after we finish and throw for a bit, and by then, especially without the pressure, I start throwing really tight clusters where I want to. What can I do to get closer to starting cold, under the pressure of an actual match?"

"Sympathy and empathy has a lot to do with that.  Its the victim card.   Both are kinda wrong.

I argue that there is more difference within a group of people, than between them.  Meaning if you had 100 white people and 100 black people,in the same enviroment, seperated, I believe they would be very similar groups, or atleast that the differences between them would be far fewer, than within those groups.  Thats why I have an issue with forced diversity, its quite literally racist.

Same goes for whites, tho I cant say I know enough about modern day white nationalists like this, I find it hard to velieve that they think whites are superior race, I more so would be inclined to believe they want to hold onto there own culture and belief systems, and are desperately afraid to lose it to immigrants.  Which is a very common thing,people get really crazy when defending there veliefs, its those beliefs that enables them to cope with life and death and everything in between, and when that gets taken, whats left?   

In other words, I see it like a scared dog, anxious and backed into a corner."

"&gt;Considering our limited knowledge about the past, and given the realty of causality, it's perfectly reasonable to believe that there was something/someone behind our coming into existence. A theist would sit in an empty room and claim that someone built it, and possibly try to look outside of the room. A theist's goal would be to meet the builder and learn more about why the room was built and make the room as good as what the creator planned it for.

This just read like an excuse for a designer or Intelligent Design argument. If the universe or our reality had some hint of a creator then atheists such as myself would at least be open to exploring the possibility. Your opening statement sounds like you just don't want to admit we don't know what started the beginning. Which I think it is better to go with we don't know versus to assume some sort of creator. 

&gt;Atheists believe that there is no reason for belief in the unknown, because we should only believe what we can support by empirical evidence. An atheist would sit in a room, and since the room is empty, he would claim there is no reason to believe anyone else is around. Mainly an atheist's goal would be to make the room as good as he thinks it should be. He will reject pursuing anyone outside of the room.

Wrong. Atheism is nothing more than the lack of belief in God. A room is not the same as the universe or reality. If an atheist sat in a room then obviously someone built the room. I don't really see what the last part has to do with the topic. Change it to the Earth where we know natural processes or various theories we have for the formation of our planet then I would want to make the planet the best it can be. Other opinions may vary. 

&gt;Regardless of whether the builder exists or not, I would argue the theist is more rational since it would make sense if the ""goodness"" of the room aligns with the original purpose of the room. The atheist's plan to make it as good as he sees fit, while well-intentioned, is not very reasonable since without understanding the purpose of anything it's easier to destroy it than make it better. 

How would a theists know the purpose of the room more than the atheist if both don't know what built the room? Why is it not reasonable to attempt to make the room as good as possible regardless of knowing the builder? Why would it be better for the theist vs the atheist?

&gt;This is about true theists and atheists, not theists because of their parents or atheists because of what they hear from witty comedians, etc. People who truly believe in a creator and pursuing the creator are more rational than people who reject any type of unknown beings. 

You act like atheists intentionally reject a being. As said earlier atheists just have a lack of belief in a God. I truly looked for God, but due to research, and not your weak ad hominem attacks against comedians, for some odd reason, I came to my current stance. 

Lastly you didnt really explain the why in your post. All you did was make a baseless claim providing no evidence for this creator.    "

"100% true: when I was in middle school, in a math class, the ""hottest girl in school"", who either sat next to me, or behind me, for some fucking reason, started pointing at the front of my pants, and exclaiming ""It's getting bigger!""

"Uh, no. Launching a full-blown invasion of California from Hawaii would have rivaled Operation Overlord in terms of complexity and resources - the fuel requirements alone would have been prohibitive. Not to mention that Japan had most of its army committed to the war in China. And the Royal Navy wouldn’t have sat on their hands while the vast majority of the IJN set itself up in Hawaii to prepare. Even ignoring the insurmountable logistical difficulties with such a plan, the overextension alone would have crippled the Japanese war effort closer to home. It was never, ever going to happen, which is why the possibility was basically ignored in Japanese pre-war planning. "

Someone got a clip of this thing? 
"I asked you 100 different ways to explain what's happened to you specifically. You gave me nothing. You've only ever blamed the media. Guess what, the media you watch/listen to sucks. Just cause the media exists doesn't mean you are forced to subscribe to it. And you know why there's anti-white sentiment? Because there's fuckheads out there who think they're superior over everyone else just because they're white, even though they personally haven't done jack shit for humanity. And those same fuckheads usually think violence is a good solution to the 'rising up' of the 'non-whites'. Remember before when I said the people who blame white people for everything are fucking morons? Hate them because they're morons. You can't choose your race but we all get a choice to be a dickhead or not. Hate people because of their decisions. I've worked with thousands of people from almost every goddamn country in the world. There's one thing that's universal regardless of your race, and that's this: some people are usually dickheads, some people usually are awesome, and most people are average, good some days, bad others, depending on when you catch them. If you're ruling out every other race in the world just because it's not your own, you're missing out on some amazing life experiences. 

Now, if you don't want to be friends with other races because you don't know how to act around them and it makes you feel uncomfortable, that's fine. But fuck anyone who openly advocates for genocide. You're either a hateful piece of shit or just young and ignorant. You don't have to be either if you don't want to."

"As a guy that is just starting this out myself I feel like you're already at a good spot where you sleeping with other men isn't an issue. Seeing it on the other hand could be really bad. We just had our first threesome and we crossed this bridge when my fiancee was just done for the night and I hadn't finished yet - her friend wanted to finish me but only if she was okay if we fucked 1 on 1. Turned out she liked it because she likes both of us (she's bi, and not to mention the whole, I'm a sub and my gal friend just dominated me and now my man is dominating her dynamic). If your bf isn't into guys AT ALL, it will probably not go okay. Especially if both guys are dominant enough that there is friction over who gets to do what. Has he even seen pics or vids of you with other guys? I'd maybe start there just to make sure it isn't an instant OH NO feeling for him. Then maybe invite a guy over and fuck him while bf just watches. Give him the option to tap out if he can't stomach it. If he can get through that then you're good to go!



But crossing this bridge for the first time in a foursome might be messy IMO. Imagine he's fucking this other girl and then you start fucking the other guy and he freaks out and everyone walks away upset. "

Also I would say that people definitely go around and explore Manhattan.

The convenient thing is that NYU's location is excellent for going to most places of interest. Whenever I have friends over, what I usually do is take them shopping in Soho and then meander our way over towards Chinatown. The barrier to exploring the city is very low basically.

"Most likely: Lone crazy person like the Unabomber. Not to be blamed on anything but mental illness

Only if you think that polarizing rhetoric has no effect on the incidence of violence by unhinged people. When someone you trust is telling you that Hillary is quite literally an incarnation of Satan, and that is *not* hyperbole, how can you claim there's a disconnect? How can you handwave it away as mental illness?"

"I'm so glad you're safe now. 

I know what you mean about the anger. This is actually a neurological issue in the brain. Essentially, you've had to spend so much time and energy being afraid and angry and surviving, that your brain is *amazing* at that. Those neural pathways are smooth and fast and have become your brain's first instinctive reaction to everything. 

But what your brain is *not* good at, because it hasn't had practice, is feeling safe and calm. That's brand new and not so easy for us to do. We have to teach our brains that the time for surviving is over, and it's now time to live and thrive. 

For me, things that help me are yoga and mindfulness exercises. I just look at ones of YouTube and practice them. Look around the house, tidy up a bit and rearrange things to the way *you* want them to be. Make it look a little different and make it yours. Take a moment every day to just sit in the kitchen, look around, and say to yourself ""I'm safe today"". 

If you can, get a copy of Bessel van der Kolk's books on trauma and abuse. Your local library may even have them. He's so good at explaining how fear, abuse, and trauma affect the body, and it will help you understand how to teach yourself to be calm and feel safe. It will take years, but every day will be a bit better than the last. 

I'm so glad you will go to sleep without fear tonight. *Hugs*. "
I dont really see the problem with having two subs. This sub was here first and even at times to seems be more active despite having a slightly smaller number of subscribers. After talking to the mod on the other subreddit they have said they have no interest in even talking over this sub or redirecting to either one. Thus I like to believe that this is a difference between the subs and a reason why people prefer to come to this one either due to our moderation or design of the subreddit itself. 
"T-Max no question. Such a sexy beast. You can always change rollers/variator, and add sports exhaust for a little more sportiness and performance. Also you can turbo charge a TMax, there's several on youtube.

"My boyfriend has the same issue. Whenever we hang out, he is always late (minimum 30 min., maximum 2 hours). In contrast, I was strictly raised by my parents to be punctual. They want me to respect my and other people's time. Sadly, now that we are close to four years, I'm seeing one of the major turnoffs and deal breaker character for me. His actions caused numerous misunderstandings lately but we talked about it and tried to resolve the issue. 

Now, it's happening again. I just try my best to just understand. Yes, it's not easy. But as long as his actions are reasonable, I understand and forgive. 

In your case,  if his character is already affecting your the dynamics of your relationship and his performance at work, he must do something about it. If he was raised with that kind of culture, he must compromise. Talk about the effects of his actions. Tell him he can change and cope up with the fast-paced world. It will take time but an attempt to change is a great start. 

Your love should meet. Talk and compromise. "

"In the tldr, OP said that he was acting distant after he said sorry.  And if you look up the definition of sulking, it's someone who is in a bad mood and acts distant/silent for awhile. There's no way to know if he was actually using that time to reflect on his behavior, for all we know he was just upset because he didn't get his way. That's not something I would normally assume, but combined with his overall behavior (the video game, comparing to his ex, acting distant after apologizing) it's certainly a possibility. 

I don't care if someone who refuses to acknowledge all the words they put in my mouth, then goes on to cherry pick the rest of what I wrote, takes me seriously.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"If most games only last 30-35 rounds and the wind staff and ice staff are 1 hit kills those entire games, it makes no difference which staff does more damage. So you must then judge the staffs on thier other attributes to determine which is better. The wind staff will kill a group almost instantly freeing you from a sticky situation. Whereas the ice staff takes a few seconds to kill them giving the zombies a better chance at downing you before dying off. Making the wind better in a normal public match. If you were going for a high round run, ice would definitely be better when you get to the higher rounds. But if those games never get past the point when the wind becomes more than one hit, the extra damage the ice does means nothing."

"From the Band of Brothers book:

&gt;While at Toccoa everyone, enlisted and officer, had to pass a qualifying physical test. By then they were in such good shape that no one was really worried about it. Almost all of them could do thirty-five or forty push-ups, for example, and the requirement was only thirty. But there was great excitement, Tipper said, because ""we knew Sobel could barely do twenty push-ups. He always stopped at that point when leading the company in calisthenics. If this test were fair, Sobel would fail and wash out.
&gt;
&gt;""Sobel's test was public and fair. I was part of a not-so-casual audience perhaps fifty feet away. At twenty push-ups he was noticeably bushed, but kept going. At twenty-four or twenty-five his arms were trembling, and he was turning red, but slowly continuing. How he managed to complete the thirty push-ups I don't know, but he did. We were silent, shook our heads, but did not smile. Sobel did not lack determination. We comforted ourselves with the idea that he was still a joke, no matter what.""

Their pushup minimum back then was only 30 and CPT Sobel could only just barely make that."

[Frostytech review of older revision Lucifer](http://www.frostytech.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=2777&amp;page=1)
"My friendships have ended pretty much the same way, both pre- and post-diagnosis. The only difference is now I'm aware that my symptoms are acting up (ie. I'll tell myself I'm overreacting and need to calm down) but my emotions are so out of control that they simply can't be reasoned with. So splitting always happens and usually I'm the one to throw the friendship in the garbage despite reason telling me not to.

One piece of advice I'll pass along is something my therapist once told me, which has served me well. People aren't nearly as averse to apologies and reaching out as we like to think. You can try, and if it fails - are you any worse off? Probably not. Just be sure that if you do reach out you're willing to do things differently this time. Most people are open to second chances, but if you blow it you probably won't get a third."

"Zombies already use weapons and will pick up armor.  When I say smarter I really don't mean that the zombies themselves are smarter so much as that they are implemented smarter.  In simple game logic, if a villager has a trade that means that he has that item.  Since they already use items they have, doesn't it make sense that they would use items they had on them?  They already even pick the best item- I'm not exactly sure of the priority but I think they use the best grade of armor/tool they have, but prioritize enchanted items.  It's just sort of extending the game logic to cover the fact that they should logically have these items.  (Without getting into too much minutia about whether they have the trade unlocked).  The shepard one was the only one that was more than autonomic behavior, and I said that one felt out of place.  If you cut a chicken's head off in real life it runs around for a while.  It seems that zombies could use the skills they had in life in sort of a brain dead way... the farmers would only remember to dig up crops, not replant them, for instance.  It's not that they are thinking... 'if I do this the player will starve', they are just going through a rote routine like they were a skipping record."

"It really depends on what kind of time line/travel  we are talking about. There are the multiverse which could mean that he’s dead but everything else that happened still happened and is unaffected. There’s the theory that if they go back in time it can create a paradox which means they will never truly stop him. Or it could be that they kill him and another rises and they still never stopped it. I think they will create their own time rules if they do that but i don’t see how. I can see them destroying Michael and maybe that itself is what resets time back to day one, the Harmon’s move in. Maybe that’s why he wanted them all dead because they are the only ones who have the power to not only stop and destroy him but to undo what he has done. Michael tells Meade that once he is crowned supreme he can usurp the power and get rid of all of their covens, meaning there are multiple covens that could pose a threat, and then he will be able to do what he was made for. Interestingly enough, his fear of Mallory and his plea to his father for not having got rid of them all def has to do with the witches so there’s something they can do they don’t know yet, or he knows either by prophecy or divination like magic, that they are the only ones who pose a threat.

"In order to draw magical energy from  other Planes, you have to use Druidry to add the energy in question into your Aura (which houses your Life Force and Magical Energy)
Of course, to add it into your Aura, you also have to find the energy is question. The simplest way to accomplish that would be to summon something from another Plane, capable of spellcasting yet weak enough to overpower. Using Druidry, simply take some of their magical energy from them, and then banish/kill the not-happy summon

Alternatively, you can travel to another Plane and simply take in ambient energy from the air. Risky, but less so than a direct summon. The trade-off here is that, barring  a very very rare ability one must be born with, it'll require cooperation with another spellcaster to banish and summon you back into this Plane. In most places, banishing a native of the Plane is highly illegal no matter the circumstances, not to mention the gray area of Eldritch magic in the first place

Thirdly, there is a certain artifact, the book Kerchkoth, which acts both as an extensive grimoire and a battery for multiple Eldritch magics. It's a fickle artifact though, tends to disappear on you and reappear in the most unlikely places years later"

"It’s actually not. I got feels for one sexy man and essentially porked myself (not in a good way).

"I've read some of the tweets and some of the women were actually creeped out by the experience. And mostly it's because these people persist despite the initial rejection. And it's not really just about normalizing rape, but treating women as commodities, not actual people, as if they're just an NPC in a game. These PUAs would claim that it's all about personality development, but are they really teaching men how to have a genuine interaction with a woman, or how they could psych their way inside her pants."

"Pewdiepie, a content creator operating solo except for trusted associates, has had the most YouTube subscriptions for a long time and is a great promoter of the fact that YouTube is a platform where a creator can make good content and share it to the world with good results. T-Series, however, is a big Indian based corporation that is soon approaching his #1 spot and will be a major blow to the idea that YouTube wasn’t for big companies in media to market themselves to the public, but rather a good platform for people to make themselves into well-respected and to maybe even make a profit off of their trade."

"You are entitled to your beliefs, and you have the right to share them.

For example: you just made the assertive claim that we shouldn’t impose beliefs on others. But that’s a belief. And I think you’d like me to accept that belief — you’re imposing it on me by stating it.

If some girl made a post here about you stating that belief and asked others whether or not she should break up with you because of that, I’d be inclined to say no. You have that right to state what you think and to try to persuade others. Why not extend the same courtesy to your girl?"

"The plastic shoe trees are fine as a temporary measure- the value of a shoe tree is more in its ability to keep the shape of the shoe than any deodorant/drying aspects- in the past most shoe trees were either solid varnished wood or the metal skeleton ones- cedar trees are a more recent phenomenon- probably because they are a cheap wood.  As for the Kiwi shoe trees, they are OK, but the handles are narrow, and may put too much pinpoint pressure on the heel cup of your footwear if used regularly (they would be ok as lighter weight travel shoe trees).  I would get a pair of trees that have a wider, more rounded handle area that distributes the pressure evenly around the heel cup.  The ones you can get cheap at Nordstrom Rack ($12~13?)  are fine.

Also, the MSQ grind is extremely difficult to put into words just how long it is. I think it's more of a chore than Vanilla/BC WoW leveling.

"Let's be honest here. Compared to DUST 514, *every other video game on the market* is boring and unambitious with the possible exception of Falcon 4.0 and its Electronic Battlefield architecture.

DUST 514's stated goal was to firmly connect two completely different MMOs in two completely different genres with completely different play styles to the point where players in one could directly interact *during a battle* with players in another. And amazingly, it **worked**. A DUST 514 player could call down an orbital strike in the middle of his FPS battle from the player of EVE. If you stop and think about it for 30 seconds or so, you come to realize how startling and how amazing that is.

CCP doesn't get enough credit for how amazing the underlying architecture of the DUST 514/EVE link was. It was the huge invisible iceberg under the two games. It was honestly and sincerely a good decade or two ahead of its time. Far future video games will link together routinely.

It's just a shame that DUST 514 wasn't a better shooter."

"I mean the city does get that vibe. Generally our sports teams end up doing well and choke when it's needed most. So I guess you could say the city has a chip on its shoulder. Like in the NBA one of the narratives is no one wants to come to Toronto for whatever reason, despite the Raptors consistently being at the top of the Eastern Conference. Everyone also always underestimates the Raptors, saying we don't have any real talent or star power. We do always feel like the underdog. Other than that city is so diverse and multicultural, I've lived in many cities across the world but I would say this is by far my favorite city and my home. It gets called Canada's New York and I know some people don't like that. I'd say this is pretty spot on from a Toronto sports fan point of view.

"Well actually I'm not Christian, as my flair clealy states... i just enjoy following various religious subs because I find some of the threads to be enlightening and informative and occasionally uplifting. However this thread I find to be very....  bizarre. Yes that's probably the nicest way I could put it, bizarre. 

I apologize for ruffling your feathers earlier, it's very clear you are incredibly passionate about a subject that I really don't care that much about. I'm a woman and I dont consider myself a feminist, but I also don't believe in the ludicrous notion that feminism is some mischievous inner workings of the devil... (mainly because I don't believe the devil is a living being but rather a metaphor for hate and the absence of love... but I digress.)

 If you think feminism is a bunch of witches and warlocks conjuring up schemes to push a satanic agenda then that's your crazy train to ride, not mine.

In response to your comment I would like to point out that this concept of ""third wave feminism"" is just semantics... it is only one view point of what feminism could be. Some people see feminism as trying to make all people equal (men, women, homosexusls, transgenders). Some people (presumably you) view it as women trying to reign over men... this view is only your opinion of what feminism is and frankly I don't know anyone else who thinks that is what feminism stands for...

Sure there might be some feminists who are trying to make women superior or whatever, but there are also feminists who just seek equality. Frankly I believe that we are all already equal in our own ways which is why I see no need for feminism... but this case you are arguing is merely just your own, again bizarre, perspective of an infinite number of perspectives.. but anywho, I'm gonna go back to living happily in my ""ignorance"" or what ever judgemental statement you choose to describe it.  (Because as much as you might try to skew it in your own head, you ARE being judgemental, and therefore a hypocrite)

And i'll just leave you here in your manic state of stress, fear, and.. what did you call it.. oh exposing the darkness of feminism. I wish you the best of luck with all that!"
"I don’t think promotions should be listed.

"Someone said music is just organised or coherent noise.  
Since the organisation and coherence is what sets it apart, I would urge people not to listen to white noise for hours on end hoping to realize what they didn't like about it.  
If the static noise is metaphor for, or a result of, the constant barage of chaos that the world is, ever since the universe began, let it be so, or don't.  
It is so rare in this life to find some semblance of elegance that you can resonate with on a deep level.  
I would much prefer a life of noticing the worst aspects of my favorite music, than trying to find the best parts of noise that meant nothing to me.  
That said, most people do some combination of both, and it usually makes things more interesting."

"&gt; Ähnliches habe ich auch in Deutschland schon ein paar Mal gesehen, aber halt alles komplett subjektiv. 

Das Problem hierbei ist, dass viele Leute glauben, sie hätten voll den Schimmer, aber eigentlich absolut *Null* Plan von der Materie haben. Wenn ich jetzt mal Depression als Beispiel nehme: Es gibt da so eine Menge an Leuten, die glauben, dass sie über Depression voll im Bilde wären, weil sie es wenigstens als Krankheit wahrnehmen und nicht glauben, dass das mit ein bisschen Yoga&amp;Co wieder vorbeigeht(immerhin schonmal was), dann aber nicht genug informiert sind, um zu wissen, dass ich nicht 24/7 als s a d b o i e rumrennen muss - ich kann, wenn ich mit Freunden unterwegs bin, auch durchaus lachen und so(und manchmal ist das auch aktiv ein Bewältigungsmechanismus). Im Regelfall sieht man mich während einer wirklich aktiv depressiven Phase ja auch gar nicht, weil ich dann halt nicht rausgeh zu Freunden um Party zu machen - dann hab ich halt mal ""viel mit Uni zu tun"" oder ""hab kein Geld zum Feiern gehen"" oder ""echt schlecht geschlafen heute"" oder verschlafen oder sonstwas. Oder ich geh genau deswegen zur Party, um mich endlos volllaufen zu lassen, siehe Alkoholismus&amp;co. Das muss gar nicht groß auffallen, sagen völlig normale Leute ja auch gelegentlich. Irgendwann entsteht da halt ein Bias, man sieht den angeblich Depressiven immer nur lachen, aber nie so richtig depressiv sein, und schwupdiewup ""Der ist sicher gar nicht depressiv"".

Und das alles ignoriert schon die Tatsache, dass alleine dieses ""der ist eh undiagnostiziert und will nur Aufmerksamkeit"" auch schon irgendwie nicht so superpralle ist(auch wenn ich das irgendwo verstehe). Im Grunde genommen diagnostiziert sich die Hälfte der Leute in Deutschland alle Nase lang irgendwie selbst - wenn ich dir sage, dass ich letzte Woche eine Erkältung hatte, dann ist deine erste Reaktion ja auch nicht ""Hat dir ein Arzt das wirklich bestätigt? Könnte ja auch was anderes gewesen sein mit ähnlichen Symptomen!"", sondern du nimmst das ganz ruhig hin und glaubst mir. Selbstdiagnose ist das aber natürlich trotzdem gewesen.

Mind you, wenn jemand sich x Jahre als YZ selbstdiagnostiziert, allen Leuten damit auf'n Sack geht und nie den Arsch hochbekommt, um was zu machen, dann versteh ich völlig, dass man davon angenervt ist(auch wenn manche psychische Krankheiten leider echt massiv gegen einen selbst arbeiten und einen aktiv daran hindern, zum Arzt zu gehen) - aber die Menge der Leute, die sich wegen angeblicher Selbstdiagnosen beschwert, ist hierzulande IMO schon verdammt hoch.

Bisschen Wall of Text geworden, aber habe diesen Vorwurf tatsächlich schon hier und da an den Kopf bekommen *trotz* Diagnose, das nervt einfach nur unendlich stark"

"This is my first Forza/Horizon game ever and I really dig it. I have always wanted a Forza game and hadn't realized Horizon 3 had been released for PC when Horizon 4 arrived, so of course I bought that instead. I am still thinking of buying Horizon 3 when it goes on a sale, but don't know if I will dislike the car physics. 

When playing offline I tend to find lots of traffic compared to online, so I don't recognize myself in that it feels empty. 

Anyways, yes there's always improvements to be made and features to be implemented. 

Here's my list for now:

**Turn on/off light (as you mentioned)**

**Turn signals**

**Start/turn off engine**

**Separate market for clothes/emothes/horns that you buy with credits or something.**

**Louder idle sound for some cars**

**Able to turn ABS and Traction Control on/off depending on the car (ABS and Traction Control can still be used in 
settings for cars that don't have those features)**

**Simulation damage should include the need to refuel, would require to implement gas stations into the world though.**

**More styling options i.e more skirts, spoilers, rims etc.**

**Interior styling**

**Neon**

I am mostly a SP kind of guy but would still like to have a MP mode where you're racing as an individual, not as a team. And a lot of other things others have mentioned several times all over reddit and the official forums. 

And a change, which may not be appreciated, but I would like for spoilers, hoods and so on would purely be cosmetic and have no effect on performance.

"I think the best way to reduce crime in Baltimore is a four-part system. Part one is to open easily accessible and free of charge family planning centers all over the city. Second is to immediately cut all dollar incentives to have additional children in our current federal and state welfare programs. Third is to open boarding schools for potentially at risk or currently at risk children and young adults in crime infested areas of the city. Making investments in infrastructure like this tax-deductible would go quite a long way. Fourth is to implement the death penalty for violent offenders and huge sentences for conspiracy or gang affiliation. I don’t know what to do with all the homelessness or rampant drug use unfortunately. 

It’s obviously never going to happen, but seeing how Baltimore is about as safe as Juarez, Mexico, (the cities  both share 53-54 homicides per 100,000 citizens) maybe we should start considering drastic measures. People in this city are living in war zones.

Fair enough but my only thing is that drafting a franchise qb may win you enough games to keep you from decent future picks.

"I didn't downvote, but it may take more than 5 years, possibly much longer, for a PS3 emulator to get to a playable state for demanding games. In the past, we could rely on ever faster PC per core speeds. Traditionally and currently, emulation requires a much much faster CPU core to emulate some other core. Per Core speed advancements have slowed a lot. 

A PS3 emulator is going to need to do something entirely new, or wait until our CPU speeds almost double. Basically, don't hold your breath."

 Brasília, 24/10/2018 – O coronel da reserva Antônio Carlos Alves Correia, que fez ataques verbais ao [Supremo Tribunal Federal](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/stf-supremo-tribunal-federal) (STF) e chamou a presidente do [Tribunal Superior Eleitoral](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/tse-tribunal-superior-eleitoral) (TSE), ministra [Rosa Weber](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/rosa-weber), de “corrupta” e “salafrária”, é alvo de uma investigação no Ministério Público Militar (MPM) para apurar ofensas disparadas em outros vídeos contra autoridades militares, entre elas o comandante do Exército, general Eduardo Villas Bôas.

 O procedimento para apurar esse outro episódio foi aberto em julho de 2018. Segundo o **Broadcast Político** apurou, dentro do Exército o coronel é considerado “louco” e tem o comportamento “abominado”.

 Em um dos vídeos, o coronel afirmou que o general Eduardo Villas Bôas é “um homem doente”, provavelmente com o raciocínio debilitado e exige que ele seja substituído por outro general no comando do Exército para prender o presidente Michel Temer.

 **TELEFONEMA.** Depois de vir à tona o vídeo em que o coronel da reserva chama Rosa Weber de “corrupta e salafrária”, o comandante do Exército entrou em contato com a presidente do TSE por telefone.

 O Broadcast Político apurou que o comandante do Exército prestou solidariedade à ministra, lamentou a conduta do coronel e frisou que o comportamento dele não é condizente com o das Forças Armadas.  
 Em nota divulgada na última terça-feira (23), o Exército afirmou que “o referido militar afronta diversas autoridades e deve assumir as responsabilidades por suas declarações, as quais não representam o pensamento do Exército Brasileiro”. “O general Villas Bôas, comandante do Exército, é a autoridade responsável por expressar o posicionamento da Força.”

 A reportagem não localizou o coronel da reserva Antônio Carlos Alves Correia.

"I might take a look at either a Ryzen 5 2600 (maybe the X if you don't want to overclock) or the i3-8350K. If you're playing mostly older games, the i3 will crush them, as it hits 4 GHz without overclocking, and has a newer architecture. However, if you're looking for a little more support in the future, I might stick with AMD on this one, since they say they'll be using the same socket for a while (up through 2021 I think, but I would check on that), and the higher core count with half-decent performance per core (better if you overclock) will make running newer games that are optimized for the higher core count easier to run."

"You’re not the asshole, but neither is your wife. As you mentioned, she has anxiety issues. For someone with anxiety, the scenario you laid out is a stressful nightmare. 

It seems like you have a bit of a parent / child relationship. I cannot imagine my wife saying “don’t make me”, for instance. There’s nothing I could “make” her do, that she doesn’t want to. I could beg, but she would need to do it as a favor to me.... I have no authority to force her because we are equals. (The same holds true in reverse)

So you aren’t an asshole for being stuck in a bad situation, and though her reaction was childish it does feel like that’s the dynamic you have set up.  

But then, I don’t really know you. Personally, the options for me would have been a cheap dirt motel, or having her drop me off then drive back herself (then pick me up, or maybe if a train was convenient for that route).  You can find cheap motels for like $60 a night, so it really doesn’t seem like it would be totally undoable. Though you might be taking a chance at bed bugs. "

"[Here's the latest info booklet from OSHA](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3074/osha3074.html), dated 2002. The numbers you remember are not wrong:

* 85 dB time-weighted-average (TWA) over 8 hours is the trigger for audiometric testing. If an employee is exposed to an environment with at least 85 dB TWA over 8 hours, then the employer must within 6 months establish a baseline audiogram for the employee and provide annual audiograms.
* 90 db TWA over 8 hours is one of the requirements for providing hearing protection. Note that this is **a single day exposure** of 90 db TWA over 8 hours; if this level of exposure mandates hearing protection, it is a stretch to call it ""safe"".
* Other requirements for providing hearing protection are if a baseline audiogram has not been performed within 6 months of the first 85 dB TWA exposure OR if audiograms have revealed damage to the employee's hearing that necessitates hearing protection.

EDIT: Remove some superflous hyphens. Also, I think the takeaway from OSHA requirements is that *under* 85 dB TWA over 8 hours is acceptable; anything over that threshold requires action from the employer to monitor and protect the employees' hearing."

"No, don't agree one bit. I used to play MTG competitively. Doesn't hold a candle to Dota in terms of toxicity and tryharding.

My card shop in Cleveland had several pro tour grinders and they were respectful even after losing to far less skilled players. Never heard any trash talking from anyone who was actually good. The average age of tryhard MTG players is a lot higher so I think that's a big factor."

"He wasn’t kicked out for actually being drunk though. 

And I really don’t think so. I’ve only seen two people get kicked out of bars for being too drunk and both times they were vomiting on the bar floor.  It’s well noted that he wasn’t in that state of drunkenness. Legally, almost every state determines minimum/maximum penalties associated with BAC at .15 . Under .15 You’re facing minimum, over .15 and your facing maximum. Some states it’s even higher.  But I agree that if the common shared stories are wrong and he was indeed alive for a few hours before his death, his BAC would have been dangerously high. "

I don't think anything good could come out of firing Hue midseason. The team is only a few executed plays away from a winning record. As the coaching staff and players grow together over the rest of the season these mistakes will get ironed out and hopefully be primed for next season.

"## [🔗 Link para a notícia completa](https://outline.com/75PWKh) 

 Um dia depois de ter [**ouvido críticas do rapper Mano Brown**](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,durante-ato-no-rio-de-janeiro-haddad-diz-que-sente-clima-de-virada-no-ar,70002560815) sobre a dificuldade de dialogar com as bases populares, o candidato do [**PT**](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/pt-partido-dos-trabalhadores) à Presidência nas [**eleições 2018**](https://politica.estadao.com.br/eleicoes/2018), [**Fernando Haddad**](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/fernando-haddad), admitiu nesta quarta-feira, 24, que o partido precisa se reconectar com a população da periferia. ""O que ele falou é a pura verdade. A gente tem que reconectar com a periferia, com a dor que as pessoas estão sofrendo"", disse Haddad.

 O candidato é alvo de críticas dentro do próprio PT por ter supostamente dado pouca atenção à periferia, base histórica do partido, em sua passagem pela prefeitura.

 Haddad comemorou o resultado da pesquisa Ibope/**Estado**/TV Globo, [**divulgada nesta terça-feira**](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,ibope-bolsonaro-tem-57-dos-votos-validos-e-haddad-43,70002560490), durante ato no Largo da Batata, em São Paulo. O petista registrou 51% das intenções de voto na capital paulista contra 49% do candidato do PSL, [**Jair Bolsonaro**](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/jair-bolsonaro), e elogiou o ex-presidente do [**PSDB**](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/psdb-partido-da-social-democracia-brasileira) **Alberto Goldmann** por ter declarado voto no PT. O comício reuniu milhares de pessoas.

 O candidato também comemorou o resultado nacional da pesquisa, que mostra a queda de quatro pontos percentuais em relação a Bolsonaro, a quem chamou de ""frouxo"" por ter se recusado a participar de debates no segundo turno. Sobre o crescimento entre o eleitorado evangélico, Haddad disse que é um reflexo das mentiras disseminadas pela campanha do rival.

 Com voz rouca, mas não se poupando de gritar, Haddad discursou apostando em reverter a vantagem de Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) e afirmou que o adversário vai levar uma ""surra"" do povo brasileiro no próximo domingo (28), quando ocorre a votação do segundo turno.

 ""Fala, Bolsonaro. Fala o que você pensa. Já que você não quer me enfrentar, fala só o que você pensa. Você vai tomar uma surra do povo brasileiro no domingo porque você não merece a confiança do povo, não merece governar esse país. Esse país é muito melhor do que você"", disse Haddad em ato no Largo da Batata, na capital paulista.

 Ao lado de aliados, Haddad jogou rosas vermelhas e brancas para o público e, em um discurso que durou oito minutos, chamou Bolsonaro de ""frouxo"", ""soldadinho de araque"", ""um grande coitado"" e disse que o candidato do PSL ""não é nada"".

 ""Pelas minhas previsões, ele está a duas entrevistas da derrota"", declarou Haddad. O petista relatou uma conversa que o articulador político de sua campanha, Jaques Wagner, teria tido com um integrante do mercado financeiro, para quem a eleição de Bolsonaro estava garantida anteontem e hoje é provável.

 ""Ele vai descobrir que hoje ela é provável, amanhã será possível, ele vai descobrir no sábado que a coisa esquentou, que o gato subiu no telhado. No domingo, que ele perdeu."" Para Haddad, as reações apresentadas em pesquisas de intenção de voto mostram que o povo está acordando por medo do que Bolsonaro, segundo ele, representa.

"We did a cabana this past summer. 

Not going to lie, it was kinda fun staying in the nicest camping option haha. The cabana is beautiful and really adds to the whole fairytale Tomorrowland vibe. We were able to leave the key with the staff at the front so we never had to worry about losing the key. We also got gifts- I got a bottle of Hugo perfume and a box of MAC makeup.  I loved being able to stand up completely inside though, we met friends that were staying at dream lodge and it was kinda annoying to have to crouch down slightly inside. 

It got hot as hell so as soon as the sun came up, we were awake. I’m small- 5’6 and 105 pounds but the bed still felt too small. We are most likely going to do the kokono next year just for that large bed, it was hard to get a decent nights sleep on the beds (even with Advil PM, earplugs, etc). 

Regardless of the specific camping option, I will always stay at the montagoe area in future years. It was so beautiful and nice and not crowded. When we first got there we hung out for a bit then made our way down to the dreamville marketplace area and passed all the other camping, and I know people love MG but it looked like hell to me. The extra money is soooo worth it to stay at the montagoe, and we were a five minute walk from the TML entrance, which was amazing when it ended and we were tired and just wanted to lay down. "

"E. Skill doesn't pair with 'Elemental' or 'Added Effect', the OP-ness would be obscene. In addition, any materia that contains more than one element doesn't pair with 'Elemental', but you can experiment and then check in the 'status' screen. Materia that have multiple effects like 'Destruct' are good for 'Added Effect' as it will try to use every effect the materia has at the same time, with descent probability (1/5 ish).

When using 'Elemental' on a weapon, it will double damage against enemies weak to the element it's paired with, but! On armour the first level of the 'Elemental' materia cuts enemy damage in half, the second level null's it, the third level absorbs it. You'll find that it's a hit-and-miss type of system, where predicting what battles will benefit from what element is hard. If you grind one area or are travelling then you can see what enemies are using and counter it. Generally I equip it for attack since more enemies use physical attacks anyway with a few exceptions."

"Umm ... confidence \*is\* being able to accept advice from others, to learn from others! Are you perhaps confusing confidence with arrogance, where someone thinks they are somehow superior? :)

To my mind, confidence is simply being comfortable with myself as I am now, flaws and all. It's a position of acceptance and thus an open mind - there is so much out there that I do not know, so I'm happy to learn from someone who does know. 

That said, I won't blindly accept advice: being comfortable with myself also involves trusting that I know enough to tell when something or someone is BS. :) I'm not always right, but a few times I've been SO right that it more than balances out the times I'm wrong."

"**Gotthard Base Tunnel**

The Gotthard Base Tunnel (GBT; German: Gotthard-Basistunnel, Italian: Galleria di base del San Gottardo, Romansh: Tunnel da basa dal Son Gottard) is a railway tunnel through the Alps in Switzerland. It opened on 1 June 2016, and full service began on 11 December 2016. With a route length of 57.09 km (35.5 mi), it is the world's longest and deepest railway tunnel and the first flat, low-level route through the Alps. It lies at the heart of the Gotthard axis and constitutes the third tunnel connecting the cantons of Uri and Ticino, after the Gotthard Tunnel and the Gotthard Road Tunnel.

"&gt; Saying ""On any given day"" strongly implied that this would be an everyday thing. Yes, it technically doesn't necessarily mean that, but this is not a court of law and, sorry, but I don't accept technical defenses.

It actually *does* technically mean that. ""On any given day"" means that you can just pick a day within the appropriate period and it applies. That's why the phrase is *any* given day. It doesn't say ""on most days"" it will be up for 4 to 8 hours.

There's room to defend them from some flak but this isn't where to find it.

"The IoT is based on allowing virtually all electronic equipment being internet addressable.

We've already seen that computers, tablets, phones, etc are all able to be compromised and are open to security hacks, especially when they don't have their security updated on a regular basis to protect against new attacks and new threats. And most of those have a life expectancy of less than 5 years, before being replaced, or reimaged, and most have virus-checkers, installed firewalls etc.

There is ***zero*** chance that a connected fridge, TV, washing machine and similar appliances will ever have their security maintained (and many have a life expectancy of 15+ years), which means that all of them will increasingly become susceptible to exploits, turned into bot-networks etc. 

So Security isn't necessarily being sacrificed for higher speeds, but it absolutely will be sacrificed in a desire to add IoT features to home appliances, to cars, or to anything else someone thinks they can profit from."

"10s has a single mech that's tuned abnormally tight for a fight of that level. The rest of it is pretty simple and DPS check is incredibly lenient but hot tail has just become traumatic for some people and they kinda overblow the difficulty of the entire fight.

If I ask my boss’ boss nicely and have a legitimate reason, I can get temporary administrative access to well over 1000.

"Almost everything. But the primary driver of that change from being one of the hardcore libertarians you see around Reddit and real life was realizing that there was no market answer for health care. Just the concept of a ""market failure"" crumbled almost everything I believed.

With health care, when you need it most, you're least able to pay. When it's an emergency, it's impossible to shop. Almost everyone is willing to pay almost infinite sums, once they're sick, to live a little bit longer. Healthy people have every incentive not to pay for health care until they need it, which is completely counter to the purpose of insurance. And ultimately who lives and dies is still decided by a death panel, that death panel is just a faceless corporation and not a government. And finally, if you are sick,  Insurance doesn't work for you. You can't get it. You're just fucked 

Once I accepted all of that I understood that there's no market solution here. From there I was no longer able to see medical debt as a personal failing. Which then opened up my eyes to the concept that many people are captives of circumstance. ""There but by the grace of God go I"" and then that opens a whole new world of wanting to equalize everyone's circumstances as much as possible without outright penalizing good luck.  

Basically everything about what I think today followed from that one idea that broke the wall."

"&gt;Our waters are very shallow for like 200 miles out.

Actually, not exactly. We have a couple of large trenches not far off the coast - some of the deepest known waters in the world. And, they're close enough that the average SCUBA diver can swim out to them, particularly in the Monterey / San Cruz Bay waters. They literally start in 60-80 feet of water, and then plummet to hundreds of thousands of feet in a near wall-like slope.

&gt; Doesn’t mean they can’t happen, but we just aren’t at the same risk levels for them as places like Indonesia

This is still largely true, however. A large portion of NorCal waters are not conducive to tsunami-like activity as result of a quake (though if you go up far enough to places around Eureka, there are definitely a few ""tsunami zones"" that are posted on various street signs).

Hydejime Kido
"&gt;Anyone who has ever told you that is a liar

OFA tests costs thousands of dollars. Emergency C-sections can cost thousands. Vet bills for any other complications for mom or puppies get expensive. Traveling to and competing in dog shows to show your dog is worthy of breeding is extremely expensive. Artificial insemination is expensive. Sire fees for the owner of the dad (if it's not you, which most of the time, if you're breeding responsibly, it will not be) usually equal about the cost of 1 puppy. And after all of this, you can still end in a miscarriage or a small litter. You can occasionally make money off of one litter, but in the long run, most reputable breeders are looking at a net loss over time. 

&gt;All our pups are have multiple vet visits before they go home.

That is not OFA testing. For Standard poodles, you're looking at, at a minimum, testing both parents for hip dysplasia (through X-Rays), an eye exam by a registered canine ophthalmologist (not your regular vet) and at least one of either an OFA Thyroid evaluation from an approved laboratory, and congenital cardiac exam from a specialist, an advanced cardiac exam from a specialist, or an OFA SA evaluation from an approved dermapathologist. The results of these tests should be easy to look up on ofa.org for any perspective puppy buyers. 

&gt;If a customer is unhappy with the puppy upon personal delivery, they will be refunded everything but the deposit. But that rarely happens with us.

That doesn't answer the question. Will you take the puppy back? What about if the family finds out later in the dog's life that they can no longer take care of the puppy? Will you take it back? What happens to the dogs you breed that the families no longer can have or want? I'm not asking about their money, I'm asking about the dog.

&gt;Many of our studs are from champion bloodlines, as well as our moms.

But are THEY champions? Have you ever been involved in the dog showing world? Have your dogs specifically been proven in the ring? Comes from champion bloodlines means very little in terms of whether your dogs should be bred.  

&gt;I'm in every doodle/poodle breeder facebook group/subreddit in existence. We want what is best for our dogs health. We aren't backyard breeders.

That is not the breed club. That's a network of backyard breeders and puppy mills sharing tips on how to make money. How does your interaction with other doodle breeders assure healthy and sound puppies? How do you interact with that network to help to create puppies that achieve a breed standard (especially since no breed standard for doodles exists)?

&gt;We don't breed girls until their second heat cycle

So... you're breeding them before they're 2 years old. This is before their bones are done growing. This is before they can even be tested to assure that they are orthopedically sound. 

&gt;Honestly, when someone is paying $1000+ before they get the pup, its not likely that pup will end up abused.

That is complete bullshit and so much more goes into being a dog owner than ""I don't beat my dog"". You don't know if these buyers are going to be able to give the proper exercise to the dogs they're looking at. And even more, for the buyers, you're not helping to guarantee them a dog that fits with their families if you're not going through an application and interview process. 

&gt;All pups are socialized before they go home. Its not hard to find people to play with our pups.

A lot more goes into socialization than letting people play with puppies. Are they exposed to a variety of different types of surfaces to walk on? Different sights, sounds smells? Different places? Exposure to the crates? Beginnings of potty training? Different animals and breeds of dogs? And all in a way where the puppies remain safe both physically and emotionally while having a good time. 

&gt;I honestly believe we are a reputable source of responsibly bred doods n poods.

If it helps you sleep at night. But congratulations. You're the reason why dog breeding has a bad reputation and you're one of the people that is contributing to the homeless dog population, the puppy mill business, and the declining health and reputations of Poodles, Labradors, Golden Retrievers, and every other breed that is commonly thrown into a doodle mix.

"If it's for the sake of figuring out what you need to eat, most people ignore the estimates from activity when calculating their TDEE.  Everyone is different and measuring calories burned from activity is nearly impossible.  We're left working with averages.  What most people do is calculate their TDEE as sedentary, add or subtract 250-500 calories for gaining or losing and then experiment from there.  If you're still not gaining or losing weight, add/subtract maybe another 250 and so on until you're seeing results.  

It's a consistent science in that the physics and mechanics of it is the same for all of us.  We can easily determine what we need based on our size.  But it's nowhere near an exact science in how it's measured for activity, so it takes some experimenting."

"It isn't at all, and if you bothered to read the link I gave you, you'd see that there is zero correlation. Since I know you won't bother, here's the first paragraph:

&gt; There is no clear correlation whatsoever between gun ownership rate and gun homicide rate. Not within the USA. Not regionally. Not internationally. Not among peaceful societies. Not among violent ones. Gun ownership doesn’t make us safer. It doesn’t make us less safe. A bivariate correlation simply isn’t there. It is blatantly not-there. It is so tremendously not-there that the “not-there-ness” of it alone should be a huge news story."

"If I was to hazard a guess, amongst other things I think its because the entire UI system for the game is dog shit, and gives you very little feedback to give you a sense you are making progress or doing anything that matters. Everything feels really disconnected because its just plain boring text on your screen. I know people would argue they dont want a traditional game UI because it's a SIM and they dont want to ruin their 'immersion"" but surely theres a better way to do the UI than plain text with the occasional colour text for emphasis. I love DCS but I feel I am one of those people similar to yourself who is looking for the game to give me some feedback while I'm playing because at the moment it just feels hollow unless I'm flying with a friend."

"Over the years I've learned when to stop trying to show people why they're wrong if they are set in their ways . You can believe what you want. I take care of my husband and he takes care of me. We work full time, we take care of everyone and everything together. Marriage and relationships require an equal partnership. You don't know what women like or don't unless you are one, and even then you can't speak on their behalf. You can believe whatever you like and I'll be living my happy life.♥️ Take care, I hope you someday become more open minded instead of pulling statistics out of your ass."

" “If you’re looking for the word that means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want no matter how much it destroys you, it’s love. And when you love someone you just, you…you don’t stop, ever. Even when people roll their eyes, and call you crazy. Even then. Especially then. You just—you don’t give up. Because if I could just give up…if I could just, you know, take the whole world’s advice and—and move on and find someone else, that wouldn’t be love.

"Mr. Lewis Cross - you get it.

The husband not only wants the same enthusiastic treatment - he wants MORE enthusiastic sex!

These women just don't get it. The husband is exerting the most effort, investing the most time and energy, and receives less than enthusiastic sex.

The comments are sickening and most likely from women who support this woman being a hardcore slut with every other guy EXCEPT her husband. If Mark gets a threesome and screaming orgasms, then the husband gets the same thing and much, much more. These sexual burnouts just don't get it.

Even worse is they try to justify and rationalize this nonsense.

The slut should have married Mark, but was not enough woman to secure marriage...so enter the unsuspecting and dutiful Beta-Provider who gets the basic duty sex and half-ass participation.

Most women have no idea or concern for a man's investment in her life when he commits to marriage. It's disgusting."

"He wasn't just cut. He never made the 53 man roster. He's been off the team since the start of the season. He was a freak athlete at the combine and shot up the draft boards as a result. He was drafted way too high, because of his athletic ability.  He wasn't nearly good enough as a player. He got injured in year one and suffered multiple injuries throughout his short career, which sapped him of valuable time to learn on the field.

I was a big Obi hopeful, so I kept an eye on the Raiders' sub. Speaking with them and reading what they wrote, he was way overvalued b/c of his freak athleticism and wasn't able to pick up the game fast enough. I don't remember with 100% clarity, but the injuries he suffered may have caused him to lose some of his athleticism.  I do remember that he struggled with the size of the NFL players. In the conference UConn plays in he's a big guy, but in the NFL, alot of men weigh 220 pounds. Maurice Jones Drew weighed 210 pounds and was listed at 5'7. A man 9 inches shorter is only giving up 10 pounds in muscle. That is a lot of mass and I don't think Obi's body could handle the collisions, hence all the injuries (and poor tackling)."

It truly makes no sense SA would leave two dots of blood and two  blood smears going in opposite direction, on an area of the dash not contacted when turning the key,  but  he didn't leave blood on the key or gear shift lever, or door handles  or steering wheel.

It truly makes no sense BD &amp; SA threw TH into the cargo area and SA left blood on the right rear door jam but not the tailgate's jam or rear bumper.

It truly makes no sense SA bled in his bathroom, hallway, and TH's car but he didn't bleed in the bedroom or garage.

It  truly makes no sense BD &amp; SA would take the cut bones to the County's Quarry, but not leave the car there, and leave the skull fragments needed to establish method of death and the teeth needed to identify the body in the fire pit.

It truly certainly makes no sense how a bullet would collect TH's  DNA, wood, and waxy substance then travel under a compressor but not collect bone, blood, or human tissue.  

The list goes on and on as to why the crime scenes &amp; evidence truly don't make sense.

And before anyone says I'm only saying this out of some fantasy that I can qualify to a tournament, I'm honestly not. I'm just worried about the quality of the tournament. I'm sure many of the people who qualify won't have been in the closed beta. However they will most likely get stomped by people who have played longer. It creates an inherent advantage."

This is a wildly radical statement with no bearing in reality. It's just flagrantly ignorant drivel. 

4 upvotes!

Edit: You're either a layman or dumb. Over 1000 journalist have been killed in middle east countries in the last few years. 1 is now the result of the Saudis. The Saudis are a pivotal part of US efforts to stop Iran and Turkey from funding terrorist groups that are killing thousands of people a week... Saudis are actively fighting the war on our behalf based on mutual interest as Iran and Turkey are their biggest adversaries in the region.  So what you're asking Trump to do, is completely embarrass our only chance at stopped radical Islamic terrorist from over taking the region on behalf of two terrorist funding governments. If Trump isn't extremely judicial here, he will fuck the Saudi alliance and push them back into their soft anti US position that funded 9/11. The Saudis are never going to publicly let their crown prince take the fall for this. It isn't going to happen. They will sever all ties to the US before that happens. 

Trump has to be so fucking careful to have every bit of evidence possible before pressuring the crown prince. If the Saudis can paint this as a false accusation by the imperials to their population, they will. 

What you're doing, either because you're not familiar or because you're ignorant, is asking the Trump fire bomb a shitty ally to to give open season to even shittier enemies. Real foreign policy looks like this. There are no good options. There are millions of pages of historical record written about no win situations like this.

For the record, this journalist was not a beacon of western thought. He was a pro Muslim brotherhood thinly veiled Islamist operating out of WAPO. That doesn't give any excuse to the Saudis for murdering him... but lets not pretend we has promoting any sort of reformist ideology or had any interest in being an actual journalist reporting news.  

Oh but 7 people upvoted you... because DRUMPH HATE DUR JOURNALIST. Do you understand that your ignorance and outrage on this actually hurts the US's position? Do you think the Saudis aren't monitoring the public opinion polls? This is how every piece of foreign policy agenda gets done.

"I'm sure you would be indicted for a much smaller amount in Canada. And possession no longer becomes the problem, it would be trafficking. 

Instead of 10kg, make it 500g. I'm sure this amount would result in criminal liability in Canada. Additionally, the man being sold to has an intent to smuggle into Canada. 

If our hypothetical person boarded a flight in Lima with 500g of coca leaves, sold it on the flight to Piura to a man knowing his intent was to smuggle coca leaves into Canada, but our person disembarked the plane to stay in Peru, he would not be indicted. 

However, if he stayed on that plane whose terminal destination was Canada, he then could be indicted for trafficking.

"&gt; Skyler did legitimately love Walt for his crimes. That's an argument for Skyler also being a piece of shit 

That's just the beginning, Skyler is the worst kind of evil, a disloyal, hypocritical *shrew*:

1) When things are good, Skyler hangs around to enjoy the criminal rewards (""[Gliding Over All](https://i.imgur.com/SLFWwVI.jpg)""). 

2) When things go bad, Skyler stabs you in the back (""Ozymandias""). That *already* makes her the most disloyal character in the show, but it was much worse than that:

3) Things went bad *because of Skyler:* If Walt did what he wanted, Hank would be alive, Gomie would be alive, Walter himself would be alive, he was willing to sacrifice his freedom to save everyone. And Skyler refused because she wanted the money (""[Buried](http://i.imgur.com/j5jkXr1.jpg)""). 

4) Finally, as if all that wasn't enough, Skyler actually blamed Walt for everything (""[Felina](https://i.imgur.com/bt2rqnJ.jpg)"") which he then conveniently accepted (to appease her/appease the politically correct media with the contrived anti-Walt pro-Skyler narrative of S5b). 

Huge differences between the two characters: Walt not only stuck around when things got tough, he accepted his blame of the shared responsibility. Skyler did neither, and because Skyler never accepted her blame, the casual viewer is also duped into thinking Skyler is blameless."

Mathematically, yes. But if you analyse it further, they MUST win all of their remaining fixtures, and Barcelona must lose all of their games.

Inter must also only win once (like against Barcelona) then lose the rest of their games. PSV should also win against Inter and Barcelona but lose to Tottenham."

"I've been listening to logic since he dropped ""The Spotlight"" so i'd say i'm a pretty old fan. This album had many problems for me. Logic said that he would be releasing an album that would feel like a classic logic mixtape which obviously made fans very excited. However a lot of things fell flat and dont feel very classic to me. The songs are very hit or miss and the ones in which he tried to make big have too many problems. For example, Wu Tang Forever although is an okay track has one big problem that most of the tracks on this thing have. The beat gets boring fast and the track is too long. Now obviously for this track it was going to be long, but with track as long as 9 minutes SOMETHING needs to happen to the beat or pace of the song to keep me interested. It needed a beat switch. For songs like the glorious five and 100 miles and running the beats in my opinion were just bad. like extremely boring, which makes the songs very unenjoyable for me. Street dreams II which had a great beat IMO felt like a scene. Which I guess isn't necessarily a bad thing, but its just not very re playable for me. Ordinary day just sounds like he was trying to recreate something like EVERYDAY or Overnight, which is a style i personally think he should avoid. Another issue I found with this album was a lot of repetition. There were many bars that I recognized from other logic songs that were literally just the words in a different order. For example On The Adventures of Stoney Bob, which I actually enjoy a lot as a track uses a line ""I'm 'bout to run a train on this girl with all my boys and her name is Mary Jane"" which is the same as when he said ""Pass the Mary Jane like I'm running a train with Peter Parker"" on Warm it Up. He also reuses the blue like a crip line in one of the tracks on here, which he used on Bounce from UP. In songs like ICONIC which i was very excited about when I saw a jaden smith feature were extremely disappointing when I didn't hear a verse from jaden. To summarize everything this album just feels like a good songs surrounded by a massive amount of filler, and the tracks are too long with bland beats. The best songs on this album are easily YSIV, Legacy, The Return, and Everybody dies. Honestly, the transition between Everybody dies and The Return is amazing. But after you listen to the return the next bit of the album is extremely boring, and then it picks up again once it get to The Adventures of Stoney Bob. If i had to rank the songs from best to worst.

1. YSIV
2. Legacy
3. The Return                                            //THIS AND EVERYTHING ABOVE IS GOOD//
4. Wu Tang Forever  
5. Everybody Dies
6. Street Dreams II
7. Adventures of Stoney Bob                         
8. ICONIC                                                  //THIS AND EVERYTHING ABOVE IS OKAY. EVERYTHING BELOW THIS IS BAD.//
9. One Day  
10. Last Call (If it wasn't 10 minutes this could be so much better)
11. The Glorious Five
12. 100 Miles and Running
13. Ordinary Day                                                      
14. Thank you

"Chapter 2: Proletarians and Communists
1. By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage labour.
By proletariat, the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labour power in order to live. [Engels, 1888 English edition]
2. That is, all written history. In 1847, the pre-history of society, the social organisation existing previous to recorded history, all but unknown. Since then, August von Haxthausen (1792-1866) discovered common ownership of land in Russia, Georg Ludwig von Maurer proved it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and, by and by, village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The inner organisation of this primitive communistic society was laid bare, in its typical form, by Lewis Henry Morgan's (1818-1881) crowning discovery of the true nature of the gens and its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of the primeval communities, society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempted to retrace this dissolution in The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, second edition, Stuttgart, 1886. [Engels, 1888 English Edition and 1890 German Edition (with the last sentence omitted)]
3. Guild-master, that is, a full member of a guild, a master within, not a head of a guild. [Engels, 1888 English Edition]
4. This was the name given their urban communities by the townsmen of Italy and France, after they had purchased or conquered their initial rights of self-government from their feudal lords. [Engels, 1890 German edition]
“Commune” was the name taken in France by the nascent towns even before they had conquered from their feudal lords and masters local self-government and political rights as the “Third Estate.” Generally speaking, for the economical development of the bourgeoisie, England is here taken as the typical country, for its political development, France. [Engels, 1888 English Edition]"

Also get a big bottle of St Remy (not to be confused with Remy Martin) if you like mixing cocktails. 9/10 cocktails which have a named cognac have that brand because the bartender/author was paid to put it there or they want an excuse to charge lots. Unless it's a spirit forward cocktail you can just sub in any decent brandy and get close enough."

Or look and Dungeon Fantasy to get a better equilibrium dedicated to a fantasy setting.

"I have two pressing issues with this concept. 

First of all, the ability to drain ult charge of any kind is OP, no matter how long it takes to charge. Since it seems like you're leaning towards the support category, the Ult needs to lean more towards buffing the team than nerfing the enemy directly. I like the idea of a gamble, so I think a better idea would be ult has an EMP style of activation and any teammates within LOS and range get one of the three buffs at random for the duration of the ult.

My other problems actually stems from the beta testing of Zenyatta. Originally Harmony and Discord didn't require LOS, this often lead Zen to give Harmony to a tracer or reaper and ignore the rest of the fight. To balance this problem, they added the LOS requirements, so that Zens would stay in the fight. A simple fix for Max could be cast the card on friend or foe, and it stays for 10 seconds or 3 second after LOS is lost, whichever comes first.

All in all though, I see potential for this concept, Might become one of my mains if this was added to the game."
"I was just using the term to represent having a single season stopped. I think the official penalty is like three seasons stopped.

In the case of SMU, the closest a school has ever come to the so called 'death penalty,' they were committing repeated violations but apparently weren't previously punished in any formal way.


In my opinion (and obviously I am not expert on the SMU scandal), if it is discovered that these payments happened over the course of several years and the school was complicit (which it clearly was), then this would strongly resemble the type and pattern of infractions in the SMU scandal.

Taboos: If there are any kind of stuff eighter the DM or one of the players don't tolerate ingame (e.  g.: evil characters, animal torture, sexuality) you have to make it clear first thing.

Setting: E.g.: tipic middleage cities, the cold north, sea with island pirates and tresure, jungle, atique roman-like

Length: (obvious?)

Tone: E.g.: horror, mistery, funhouse

Theme: E.g.: you are the students of the great adventurer academy, you go explore ""the great unkown"", you take part in the war between hobbgoblins and elves

(End of campaign)

Character concepts: I think it's great to do it together, because this way you can bend them together. (At leat to the degree where the characters can stand one another.)

And ofcourse all this all together mixed up. Let yourselves be creative!"

"So first off, thanks for mentioning [that comic](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/) because I hadn't seen it before, and it's definitely got a very interesting and important point to make.

However, and maybe this is due to my naivete or male perspective, but I have a couple of small issues with it.

First off, I'm *not* saying this isn't a problem that exists for a lot of people, because clearly it is.  If both partners are working to provide money, then it seems terribly unfair that only one would be burdened with the bulk of the housework and the ""mental load"".

However, and this is where my main issue lies, this doesn't seem as useful when looking at ""traditional gender role"" households or otherwise single-income households.  Also another caveat, I'm not trying to say these types of households are good or better than two-income households or anything like that.

If one partner is spending their time at work, and the other partner stays home to take care of the children, couldn't the greater share of housework and ""mental load"" be looked at more as a division of labor?  After all, it's not like working a job doesn't come with it's share of ""mental load"" and actual work to be done.  In that kind of circumstance it doesn't seem so outlandish that the ""breadwinner"" might take on an ""underling"" role while in the household and defer to the homemaking partner when it comes to helping around the house.

There were also some small things like ""Right now, only feminists are demanding longer paternity leave"" that seemed a bit more extreme than necessary.

Definitely some great stuff though, I hadn't ever really thought about how offering to help with chores pre-assumes that the person you're offering to help is expected to carry the bulk of that work.

EDIT: Also, I'm not sure how well this comic's argument applies to emotional touching in a relationship.  Everyone needs clean clothes (more or less), everyone needs clean dishes (more or less), but not everyone needs or even wants the same degree of different types of emotional connection.  Maybe one person really enjoys being touched and getting massages and stuff, maybe another person doesn't like that as much but is much more interested in long talks, or just quietly sharing an activity, or whatever.

I think it's totally reasonable to expect a partner to ""share the load"" when it comes to chores that pretty much objectively need to be done, but emotional support is far more subjective, and sometimes expecting your partner to know what kind of support you want and when/how much you want is unreasonable, when a bit of communication would be far better for everyone."

I don't know if I'm explaining this right since the terminology is all new to me, but basically, to widen and collapse the frame, I'd like the side supports to move freely. I'm imagining them with something like a tee (female?) at the top that the top bar (the pull-up bar)fits through such that the tee can swivel around the bar going through it.

"1: So since some of the servers were getting greedy and overcharging people, Mojang banned many forms of monetization on servers. This out an end to the money-grabbing servers, but some of the more generous servers could no longer make money, which took out most of the creative people in the Minecraft fan base.

2: Minecraft in general just got worse after Microsoft. Worse terrain generation, worse mobs, worse food system, and other things. This drove away the casual players.

3: And finally, what killed Minecraft once and for all was the 1.9 update. Sure it made combat more complex, but it was a huge push factor for the fan base. 

So all the creative people, the casual players, and the PvP pros left, and the only remaining part of the fan base were cringe 2-year olds."

"&gt; The Shah of Iran was already in power before Mossadegh was deposed - in fact, he was put in place by an Anglo-Soviet force who deposed his father in WW2, because they feared Iran was going to join the Axis.

The Shah also supported nationalization of oil. While a lot of shit was happening in Iran at that time, the tipping point was when the CIA coup, in which they *offered* the Shah to take power, saying that if he didn't comply he would be deposed too.

Please do not try to minimize the devstating role that the US had in Iran. Even if Russia and the UK had a much bigger role prior to the 53 coup, that one was in fact carried out by the CIA and in the ensuing decades Iran was a puppet state to the US, and nothing else, with extreme torture, corruption, mismanagement of resources and general incompetence as a result."

YES to this. Teens so rarely are genuinely listened to by the adults in their lives. Even the most loving, well-intentioned parents can come off invalidating when they rush toward advice and problem-solving (i.e. ""fix it"" mode) before teens feel heard. To have someone give them space to show up however they might be feeling — without any agenda of their own —  can be radically healing for adolescents. Especially in our culture of performative success and hyper-achievement."

he is a dwarf, his father was a famous blacksmith and the sword was his best creation. The sword was to be sold to a person who killed him and stole the sword. Now the player must take revenge on the person who killed his father and find the sword again. The person who killed the father sold the sword further so there is a longer revenge plot later for him. sorry, it's a little hard to explain in english!
The player is brand new, a good friend of mine and I had a conversation with him about what he wanted with his background story and the sword. I know he's a bit impatient and he gave a clear impression that he wanted the sword soon.
My idea was that the sword could have +1 and a parry effect. Once in combat, he can use a 1d6 to reduce an enemy attack roll (only onde per long rest). thought it could fit since level 3 characters easily goes down. I dont know if thats to strong and i dont know what to do with the sword later. It would be kind of bad if the sword never evolved later in the campaign"

"I see your point, but I think, for me, it would be easier to say no blessings on behalf of some marginalized group.  It would be perceived in a more ""noble"" way. I know of a nevermo man who, prior to 1978, refused to shake the hand of any Mormon, and told them clearly why. He just said: **I'm not shaking the hand of someone who discriminates against blacks.** (This was in Utah, so I imagine the issue came up a lot).  It had a huge impact.  I mean, who would golf at a golf course that didn't allow blacks? And yet men continue to participate in rituals that women are not allowed to conduct.  While it may be shaming to skip a blessing on behalf of yourself, doing it for the cause of equality would create very positive waves and even be admired by many. "

"I was in your exact same boat up until the 2070 went up for preorder. They increased the price $100 when they went live for pre-order here in Australia, from $900 to $1000 AUD overnight. That caused me to just decide to go with the 1080ti. I got one new for $1020 AUD, so it was just barely more expensive.   


The 1080ti is a better product, and will give you 20% faster performance over the 2070. I would have gone for the 2070 still if it was a few hundred cheaper, but at the same price it was a no brainer.   


I will miss out on some of the new features, but raw performance is more important to me right now since my main need for power was VR performance. "

After the debate is when it swung to the NDP’s favour.

I'm also biased because I want a damn medic DMR, or at least something semi auto that's not the pistol. Or something that sounds like it has a punch instead of what we have now. The two medic weapons we've had added to the game have had middling results, with one of them being basically completely useless and the other being better on its crossperk than on medic itself.

One of the weapons added wasn't even a medic weapon but is commonly used on the perk regardless because there's no need for anything but the medic AR mostly due to the dart rate.

It's just tiring seeing all these other perks get cool *and* useful weapons, and medic gets so little after a few years."

"Relevant content. Think about what you respond to on LinkedIn (if you don't use it, start doing so now, grow your network because you need to invest in it if you want to see success in it). Learn what people engage with. LinkedIn is more business-minded than the other networks. 

Content that helps people grow in their jobs is key. People come to LinkedIn to grow their career. Remember that. No one says, ""I'm gonna log on to LinkedIn to see what others want to sell me today."" The sales come through becoming the trusted advisor that helps them in their own job.

Directed social media programs for one of the largest tech companies in the world. Over 1 million LinkedIn followers. We saw great success with it. It's really about helping others do their job better and advance, which then feeds into them seeing you as a trusted source of knowledge and a company they seek to do business and partner with.

LinkedIn is awesome in that once you grow that audience, you can target them really well, even organically. So you can say, post a piece of content to just those followers who are executives, and then post something to just those that are manager level. This allows you to post more content to LinkedIn without overwhelming all your followers with stuff that may not be relevant to them. You need to grow your audience to a decent size before worrying about this but it's an awesome option to have."

Let’s be rational. This was some nut job, plain and simple. He may have been spurred on by the words of Trump, but that’s as deep as this goes.

If you read Woodward’s book, the administration absolutely does *not* have the organization to pull off anything that’s a conspiracy. In something ironic, in the same way that Trump can help but lie, he can’t help but to also blurt out the truth. He can’t keep secrets.

"To each their own and as you know everyone with the diagnosis is different. 

So you are saying the only way you can be sex shamed is if someone verbally tells you. But it’s okay to treat them differently?

So if my partner slept with someone and I decided I wasn’t going to talk to them even though we share the same household. Wouldn’t that be neglect and sex shaming without any communication needed?

I was fluid bonded with her and my ex. My ex had free reign of what she did, I knew who she was sleeping with but no idea their protection level I had no idea of her husbands level of protection as he was also quite a bit of a liar. The married ex even though she knew her never asked. So me being the only one honest in this situation about my sexual status and then being treated differently is not by any means sex shaming?

If you look at racism, people can sue over someone else getting hired or raise based on skin color alone and punishable by law. The crime is about how that person feels. If someone shouts a racial slur because they think it’s normal and say hey I’m not racist and they aren’t normally even though they didn’t intend to hurt someone it doesn’t matter if that person feels hurt by it, that is racism. Saying oh you’re probably not as smart as me and it’s a man saying it to a woman, that can be perceived as sexism even though objectively it may be true.

If you enjoy a sex life of deviant kinks with an adult and you say you dislike pedophiles. It’s your personal view and it’s not illegal but it’s sex shaming... and fun fact only 3% act on it. How would you feel if your sexuality was always questioned.

The point is the level of blatantness or intention doesn’t define an action as or as not, just the action itself. Treating someone differently for their sexuality in a negative manner is sex shaming.

Yes her feelings are hers. She was hurt. She chose to limit our physical exposure to mutual masturbation. She chose to not give me a voice in any of it. That’s fine for her to do. I am agreeing with you.

But that also mean that I as a human can still feel that I was being treated differently due to my sexuality. I did not deceive anyone and told her before hand I made no promises when it came to letting her know I would do this before hand. She knew who I was and it was no surprise. I as am human being felt ashamed of and wrong of my sexuality. My partner showed an extreme lack of trust yet also still wanted to use me physically. I am allowed to feel sex shamed in that situation. If she did not like who I was sexually she should have broken it off instead of keeping me for her without any regard to how I might feel.

You think about your actions before you do them and how they would affect the people you care about right? Be it intentional or not it’s something most people weigh before making major decisions.

I am not saying it’s a crime to sex shame or a crime define your own personal boundaries but you can’t expect someone to not feel sex shamed when they change their boundaries based on your sexuality because what they are telling you by doing so is that those actions are wrong in their eyes. 

It feels like what you are saying it always has to be a direct assault and clear. Yet a person can be sued for sexual harassment if they gets a covered but noticeable boner in public and someone feels offended or they scratch themselves and the someone things they are doing it sexually.

I’m open to listen more but please don’t be treating me different due to my diagnosis. I do treatment and well part of it is not letting people walk on me and accept their views as right when objective research is on my side. "

Wasn't me. Those marching are mostly all seeking jobs, welfare, and Obamacare.

Dominican drug dealers often fly into Mass. using stolen identities they bought in Puerto Rico, and then getting Mass. driving licenses, social security cards, voter registrations, and EBT cards. Law enforcement has caught some who were collecting welfare here (stolen ID) and in Puerto Rico (true person) at the same time.

One of those arrested in this case, had used a different name and already been deported in 2015. We need to do better at stopping reentry by Dominican drug dealers using multiple stolen identities.

"I think multiboxing in an open-world setting is completely different than multiboxing in a specific, queued PVP setting.  In the former, people run around, doing WQ, casual ganks, and farming mats, but there isn't a specific reward to fight other people for besides maybe like bounty bags from assassins and war supply crates, but that's a stretch.  

It's a totally different ballgame when you queue into something like an arena or BG where there is a fixed reward for winning and for losing.  It actually doesn't matter if multiboxing confers a definite advantage or even disadvantage to either team, because either way you're making the game shitty for one team or the other.  If it's an advantage the other team is fucked over, and if it's a disadvantage, you're sandbagging for your own team.  Either way, real players are being affected and the correct policy should be a blanket ban on multiboxers in all forms of queued content.  They should be more consistent on policy, though, so let's hope these recent decisions are part of a trend.

Also, I think the focal point of Blizzard's communication with Malseph was in regards to his particular situation and behavior, specifically around the circumvention of /follow being disabled in PVP."

"Not really. In a proper intermittent fasting diet you still consume the same amount of calories as you would eating three meals a day. You know how you might eat at 7-8pm, then eat again at 7-8am? Yeah that's just a 12 hour fast. 

Wait four more hours, and you've got yourself a 16:8 intermittent fasting diet. As to why this may be good for you, I'm not a doctor/nutritionist, but it has to do with hormone regulation. It's also been shown that it can help maintain your resting metabolic rate through the process of calorie cutting and weight loss. Though if you're losing weight, you're gonna need some kind of physical activity to help maintain your RMR.

Maybe you're talking about occasionally going an entire day without eating, an intermittent 24 hour fast. I don't know as much about that, but it's still not 'anorexia for tech bros'.

All that said, people with eating disorders often use restrictive diets as a socially acceptable way of not eating and that is a problem, but in no way reflects on the health of the diet itself. "

"In fairness I too am of above average intelligence. But now it doesn't piss me off so much. I still feel like I don't fit in a lot because I don't have the same interests as my very traditional, simple coworkers (I teach in a extremely homogenous elementary school of all young, married,  procreating, white women). I truly do know more than them, but I don't feel that seething hatred of what a shitty job they do, or the angst of how broken our public education system is. I feel like I have some perspective of how to better focus my energy now. I could never do that before when so much broken shit to worry about. Racing thoughts, delusions, and disorganization don't help either of course. But now I can recognize how nurturing they are when I'm not. They may not be providing the more rigorous content but they are teaching a lot of other skills, skills that I never appreciated or even recognized because I never had control of myself. Sorry to ramble on, but like you it's nice to connect with others with a more similar manifestation of this disorder."
"While some of these issues may arise in parliamentary discussion periods, it is highly unlikely that they would amount to any substantial waste of time given the nature of how bills are submitted and debated by legislature. If, for example, an MLA from a somehow elected flat-earth party (which is incredibly unlikely as securing any seats would need to meet the minimum voter threshold) put forward a bill to alter school curriculum to be amended according to their flat-earther beliefs, they might have the space to read their bill (twice), but it's unlikely that any substantial debate would occur on the issue, beyond other parties lambasting the MLA for wasting their time and a subsequent failed vote. The complete lack of potential for the bill to actually be voted into law would amount to a complete lack of media coverage as well. 
While flat-earthers are easily dismissed, something like immigration is much more likely to generate debate and discussion. I think that the dynamics that in immigration systems need to be discussed at length and in consideration of the dynamics at play. I am on the complete opposite end of the spectrum, where I believe that borders should generally be done away with and people should be allowed to move freely, unobstructed by national borders. While I don't expect my viewpoint to be taken up by a majority of Canadians anytime soon, comparing the benefits of freedom of movement (UN defined human right, potentially abating nationalist tendencies/conflict, potential to realize increased well-being for more people/the environment), to the benefits of having borders in place (managing service provision, ideological and physical safety, etc.) is an important discussion that can result in compromises and/or complementary programs to address underlying issues, rather than allowing them to fester unobserved. Many of the extreme right groups in Europe have concerns about how immigration affects culture and job security, which are valid and difficult to address concerns, but impossible to address if they are not heard. If we have government that can actually respond to cries of ""no more immigrants"" with ""why not, what are the underlying issues?"" we have a chance of actually creating a positive impact on concerned communities. 
While majority governments/FPTP offer relatively efficiency in that they are not required to earnestly discuss bills before approving them, they do little to ensure that wack job theories are not discussed. Just look at Trump to the south and his immigration bans/border wall, or Ford in Ontario who removed consent from sex ed curriculum and is gutting the labour act. They both are operating with relative impunity as they know they only have to appease party supporters once every four years. "

"Lentil soup is nutritious, filling, and delicious!  It's also cheap to make and can easily be made vegetarian/vegan.  Here's how I make mine.

You will need:

* a *large*, thick pot, cutting board, knife, spatula

* 2 lbs dried brown lentils.

* 2 medium onions

* 1 bulb garlic

* 28-oz can of crushed or stewed tomatoes, or a jar of good pasta sauce (e.g. Mezzetta)

* oregano

* 2-3 bay leaves

* black pepper

* 1/2 to 1 cup dry white wine (e.g., chardonnay, sauvignon blanc).  One of those little individual bottles that they sell in 4-packs is OK, or a small Tetra Pak.

* chicken or vegetable stock (optional but recommended)

* a chunk of cheese (parmesan, grana padano, pecorino romano, aged gouda), optional

* salt

* steamed brown rice to serve on the side

Instructions:

* Get 2 lbs dried brown lentils.  I like to soak them overnight and drain them, but this isn't absolutely necessary.  Set aside.

* In a separate large pot, saute two diced onions and two diced carrots on medium heat.  After onions have softened significantly and started to brown, add garlic.  Saute until the harsh scent mellows a bit, maybe a minute or so.

* Pour some dry white wine into the pot (cheap chardonnay or sauvignon blanc works), using a non-metal spatula to scrape the browned bits off the bottom of the pot.  This will add flavor to the soup.

* Add ground black pepper, 2-3 bay leaves, and a generous sprinkle of oregano to the wine/onion/carrot/garlic mix.

* Add either a 28-ounce can of crushed or stewed tomatoes, or alternatively, most of a jar of good pasta sauce, like Mezzetta or something better.  You can use diced tomatoes or shit-tier pasta sauces like Prego in a pinch, but it won't taste as good.

* Add a heaping spoonful of Better than Bouillon chicken stock paste.  If you want to make the recipe vegetarian/vegan, you can leave this out or substitute vegetable stock.

* Add lentils, and add a tall glass of water to dilute.  Turn fire up so that soup is simmering, but be careful not to burn them.  The exact level of water and heat you need will depend on your burner and how thick your pot is.  Stir occasionally so food doesn't stick to bottom of pot.

* When soup is gently bubbling, turn heat to low, cover, and let simmer for a while.  For extra nutrition, you can add fresh or frozen spinach, kale, or broccoli, although if you use frozen, it will increase cooking time.

* Lentils are done when they are soft, but not exploded into smithereens.  Again, how long this takes varies, so best to check after 30 minutes, and every 15 minutes after that, stirring occasionally.

* At the very end, you can stir in grated cheese if you like for extra flavor.  I like parmesan (real cheese, not the sawdust from a can).  You don't have to get the origin-protected Italian stuff; Sargento works fine.  I also like grana padano, aged gouda, and pecorino romano.  Add salt if you like; for me, the combination of canned tomatoes, stock, and cheese is easily enough.

* Enjoy!  I like to serve over steamed brown rice.

Sorry about the lack of measurements in the recipe, but I just kind of go by the seat of my pants when I make it.  If anyone is interested, let me know and I will try to come up with more precise measurements.  But it's a great winter recipe."

"If you want it to be more uplifting: what's the silver lining to the otherwise tragic story? When this door closes, what other door opens for your protagonist? There are endless ways you could go with that.

The first thing that came to my head (for better or worse, but I'd recommend watching it either way due to its relevance here) was the second half of La La Land, and even though that was a story of an ultimately doomed relationship, I found it to be ""uplifting"" in a sense because they each found success in their careers in place of their relationship and there was a suggestion of, ""well, it's over now but we can still be happy about what we had and can dream about what might have been."" The dream sequence at the end presented a sort of ""what-if"" and they share a smile in the film's final moments. Relationship failed, happy(ish) ending nonetheless. Not saying you should copy that, as your story is different, but in broad strokes I hope there is some lesson to take away from that movie! Hope this helps."

The way to approach this, and the more important thing in the long run, is that carrying that much extra weight around is shortening her life. Tell her you want her to be around to share retirement together, and spend time with grandchildren, and that you want her to be able to do all the things with you that active older couples do. You should address this. Just leave attractiveness out of it, do it for her health, and yours."

"This is a trick question: you see, not everything is mentioned in the Bible. I believe in God but the message He left with us is scripture alone. So let me ask, when do you begin planting? Do you use a calendar? Do you go be nature? Either way, you are trusting yourself to know when to plant. But if you want proof, the seasons work because of our axis tilt rather than our proximity to the sun. No flat earther has ever given the sidereal model for explaining time in the Southern Hemisphere vs. the northern hemisphere without succumbing to the revelation that we are on a spherical object. We may not put as much weight in what men say but there are things that can be proven with evidence, logic and math.

You don’t have to believe me and I don’t have to believe you. However, once the truth is revealed you’ll notice the paycheck Rob Skiba receives to speak at events. You’ll realize that Mark Sargent just wants a lot of attention.

The irony is that skeptics against them are also against our religion, so I get your dilemma. But I assure you that the flat earthers take glory away from God by making this wonderous globe into a flat disk. Now what if Jesus believed in a globe, that would settle everything right? There scripture to support this but you’re probably already familiar with it."

Winters and Nixon ASK what’s going on and he tells them, they do very little talking because they aren’t in the scene very much. He told them what was going because they asked and because no one else knew. Change Fallon out for anyone else and the scene plays out exactly the same. He wasn’t jarring, didn’t take over the scene acting like he normally does and he did a great job with the six or so lines he had. I don’t know why people are bitching about him.

"Well that article has lots of references. That's a good thing ... if the references actually say what they claim they say. Let's have a look shall we?

&gt;two-thirds of Americans don’t believe Native people experience significant racial discrimination. 

The study is primarily (overwhelmingly) based on social media analysis. Seriously ... they've based their conclusions on what people say on social media. Enough said.

&gt;Native Americans are more likely to be killed by police than people of any other race. 

They link to an article which lists a bunch of native deaths at the hands of the police. It 'reports' a CDC study, but doesn't present figures or link to the study. Sorry ... if you don't cite, I don't trust these days. Especially in an article which is written for maximum emotional impact.

&gt;Native women are 2.5 times more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted 

It seems that the problem here is twofold ... apparently tribal courts aren't very effective, and have no jurisdiction over people who aren't a member of that particular tribe. I can't really comment beyond that, as I find the concept of tribal courts too complex for a brief response.

&gt;Native youth not only have the lowest graduation rates of any racial group

The education system in most Western countries are fucked ... we know that. In this case it's apparently down to 

&gt;the Bureau of Indian Education, which is housed in the Department of the Interior and oversees 183 schools across reservations in 24 states that serve about 48,000 students. 

I could continue ... but what I'm seeing in all of these issues is that being segregated from the rest of society isn't doing these Native Americans any good. 

I also note that searching 'native american' brought up plenty of hits discussing their issues ... which rather lets the air out of the complaint that they are invisible.

"I guess what I said fell on deaf ears, because there you go again, right back at their throats.

They have been manipulated just as we have. They view us as just as evil as we view them. By every empirical metric, that can't be true, so somebody is wrong, but we are all equally incapable of admitting that it might be us. The answer is likely both, as both sides have been manipulated and fed false information. The Russians are just as much on the side of the left as they are on the right. They are actively playing both sides against each other.

For some reason, people tend to underestimate Russia. They've done a good job of playing up their charisma and playing down their actions. Russia is capable of a great many things. Espionage and interference has been their MO for decades. They wield terrifying power, but everyone in America sees a picture of Putin shirtless riding a horse and thinks he's a jolly grandpa. Vladimir Putin is the single most dangerous person on the face of the Earth. He does stuff like this for breakfast."

"Apparently many on this sub have never heard the “little bantha on tatooine” story. So I will post it

Once upon a time there was a little Bantha on tatooine. Every morning and every evening he would line up to get his food. And every morning and every evening the other little banthas would cut in line and steal his food. The little bantha cried and whined to his mother that it wasn’t fair that the other little banthas ate his food and cut in line. Every time his mother said nothing. One day he saw that he had weird spots on him and it was skin cancer from being out in the sun all day. He noticed the other little banthas didn’t have skin cancer and so he cried and whined again to his mom that it wasn’t fair and again she said nothing. Then one day a Krayt dragon came along and ate the little banthas mother but avoided the other little banthas mothers. Again he cried and whined that it wasn’t fair but alas his mother was gone. Finally after a few weeks he lay there almost dead from cancer and not eating, and as he lay there dying he sees the other little banthas playing and having fun. As he was about to cry and whine again he finally understood the world of tatooine was just not a fair world. Soon after he perished in the extreme heat, dehydrated, cancerous and bloated. The little bantha was so disgusting that womp rats avoided going near him. Eventually the little bantha exploded from all the gases building up inside him and the little bantha was finally no more. The end "

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

I was looking at the stack of nerf guns in a toy store (I don't intend to buy, but I just appreciate looking at nerf guns) when this ~~brat~~ kid took one nerf sample and started playing with it. The kid was unsupervised while the mother shops somewhere in the store.

If I remember correctly, the store clerk told the kid to not shoot at anyone / anything (maybe he doesn't want the kid to make a mess?). But what did that kid do a few seconds after? He pointed the gun at me, a total stranger, pulled the trigger and shot me at my temple (a little too close to my eye).

He immediately apologized afterwards, said he didn't know the nerf gun was loaded and put the gun back to the shelf. I was surprised at what just happened, but I didn't scold him. His mom is nowhere near and I don't want to make a scene. I may or may not have given him the death stare.

I guess I'm fortunate I'm not a real gun enthusiast with a random brat playing around with guns.

"Like most of Ito's stuff, the horror is meant to be surreal and to not have an obvious explanation. *Something* is causing some people to obsessively stitch other people (who are likely also afflicted, since they don't resist) together, and is causing some (probably the same ones doing the stitching) to fly aircraft and hijack radio broadcasts to transmit a message. As it spreads, the scale of attacks becomes larger, and those affected are eventually able to take over military jets, suggesting that the government has effectively ceased to exist. Not!Kirie Goshima is one of those afflicted in a way that causes them to perpetrate acts of mass violence. Eventually succumbing to a mind virus causing people to horrifically mutilate themselves after fighting it for the entire comic, definitely proves that, all appearances to the contrary, she is absolutely, 100%, *totally* not Kirie Goshima.

In this case, the horror is also meant to represent a real-world social problem. The pressure to conform to societal demands presents such a heavy psychological burden to some young adults and teenagers in Japan that they just drop out of society entirely, and become hikikomori, like the main character of the story. The madness that causes people to sew others (and likely themselves) together probably reflects how he sees the world."

"&gt; According to the book ‘Chaotic Creatia’, for example, Daedra do not recover instantly after being killed - they have to reconstitute new bodies, which takes time, so a slain Daedra isn’t available to just jump back into the fight - though how long this reincarnation takes isn’t clear, so it could be less of an impediment, or more, depending on that.

That was mentioned in Shivering Isles too. The Knights of Order directly taint the ""Fonts of Rebirth"" for the Dark Seducers and Golden Saints which prevents them from reforming until you remove their obelisks. I'm fairly sure that dialogue from that quest also was an early confirmation of the whole ""element that goes to a central location where the Daedric souls reform a body during an undetermined period of time"" way of describing Daedric rebirth."

Three: The church doesn't like competing with exmormons.  When you search Mormon, so much ""anti"" stuff comes up and they want to distance themselves from these searches.  So we as exmormons need to make sure that even when people search ""the church of... Blah blah blah"" the truth still pops up."

"Some things I have noticed (PS4): 

* Gumball icons don't appear in the ""progress and unlocks"" menu when hovering over them (icon should appear in the box to the right)
 
* The clip goes into the winter's howl too quick (able to cancel animation and shoot when reload animation is only half way done)

*  The background smoke in the ""create a class"" menu will not render in until the player has selected from the ""weapons"" category, ""elixirs"" category, or the ""talismans"" category (smoke should be there from the start) 

* The speed loader attachment will usually not render in while reloading, causing the character to reload an invisible clip into the gun. 

* ~~The inability to pick from any class except for the first one.~~ (nevermind..) 

* Both nova crawlers and hellhounds have collison before they spawn in.

* Max ammos occasionally don't refill one of your guns if you have two (don't have anymore details, just noticed while playing blood of the dead, happening on the blundergat, can happen on other weapons too)

* Many spacing errors and some grammatical errors within subtitles 

* ~~Inconsistent box speed across maps (sometimes the box will be unusually fast, sometimes not. this has mostly been winessed on classified, might apply to other maps)~~ (I should pay attention..) 

* Buyable prompts hang on the player's screen even after said buyable is purchased (mainly witnessed on classified) 

* The elevator music in classified overtakes the round change music and sounds (could also be applied to character quotes, not sure) 

* Hellhounds still have a tough time manuvering stairs. It takes a bit for a hellhound to go from the top of the war room to the bottom (this might apply to other maps) 
 
* Teleporting from Area 51 back to the pentagon is bugged (player is outside of purple warp graphic)

* Emptying the ""king and country"" while downed and trying to shoot again will cause a red graphic to be misaligned with the ammo count

* Holding down L2 and R2 while your special weapon is inactive will cause a hud element and sound to continously play.

* On IX, picking up the cauldron in the arena will not remove the blue glowing effect that accompanies it. 

* Scepter of RA will occasionally not render in while being used. 

* In an online match, your in-game lobby leaderboard will dissapear if other players leave the match 

* The blue skull in the prison cage can also be found in the cage next to it. 

* The picture of IX in the online multiplayer lobby is incredibly pixelated.

* Many typos within Dark Ops challenges (mostly refering to number amounts. EX: beat the IX ee within 1 minute instead of the intended 115 minutes)

* After an online lobby goes back to the pre-game lobby, the box with the map picture will become incredibly thin.

Some friendly suggestions: 

* Winding up a monkey bomb takes way too long. Speed could be increased a tad. 

* Some sort of speed cola alternative would be nice. 

* The collision on IX's pack a punch is weird. Some players find it hard to place or retrieve weapons from pack a punch. 

* Level 1 specialist abilities could do a tad more damage to mini bosses

* Sniper headshot sounds from multiplayer are currently present in zombies. It's satisfying in multiplayer, but I see no reason for it to be in zombies. 

* This one isn't a big deal to me, but I do see people wanting the option to toggle hitmarkers on and off. 

Keep up the good work, Treyarch "

Funnily enough, in FFXI this wasn't always the case since the bosses were RNG in what skills they used and when except for set HP threshold attacks. In WoW its paint by numbers, roll your face a crossed the keyboard, easy and predictable.

Most players who ditched FFXI in favor of WoW when FFXI was in its prime was due to the difficulty of the fights and not guaranteed drops."

"you need to use a linux bootable livecd to create linux filesystems which will also require you to use a separate usb drive for the bootable media.  windows is incapable of preparing linux filesystem and partition configurations.
  
If linux mint doesn't have a ""try me mode"" that just boots to a text console terminal or a gui sysrescuecd will boot to a command console only as an overall preference. if your preparing for this project from a windows pc using rufus to create a bootable linux setup or live media will allow you to progress further once your intended system is actually running Linux.  
  
Ubuntu install dvd's will also boot to a GUI if you select that option. from there you can use the command console to configure a usb stick for use with a portable install.  
  
uefi bios with a portable usb stick may work but uefi bios also may not because for uefi to boot an os install a boot menu entry needs to be installed in the uefi bios firmware and that setup step is typically a manual or automated setup task that only runs on demand.

I did make a general ""non-novice marathon training advice"" post in /r/xxfitness because there are a lot of people there with an interest in running but the running content itself is often pretty terrible, but as far as the race was concerned: it was slightly chilly but overall good conditions, I was right within the parameters of my goal, I ran the early miles well but got a bit too speedy from miles 5-9 which I think led to me not-that-interesting-or-unusual 5 minute positive split between the first and second halves, it got hard once people spread out a bit and I was alone, I slowed down on the Mile 21-23 uphill section then managed to speed up a bit at the end, and I don't have my exact splits, just a handful of splits from a few pace mats throughout the race. That's it, really. I ran a good race, but it was also just so standard and predictable in every single way lol.

Regardless... sub-2:55 ain't easy, so I'm pleased with that for sure.

"Realistically, you're not using karth ult on CD. Predator adds a fairly substantial buff to the damage.

e.g. level 1 ult is 250dmg + ap, predator will add 60 +0.1ap. If you get 1kill off that, the extra ap will stack up and add more next time.
If you're running eyeball collection and absolute focus too, that's all more damage than you'd expect from a karth ult early on. That's how froggen builds him.

Basically it's great if you can't win lane, but can get fed by ensuring finishers. Otherwise Aery/comet will do way more dmg in lane."

You get more control, less glare, and more options with the retrofit lamp option. For those, you wouldn't have to purchase anything other than new lamps for each fixture (and keep your existing trims)."

Sometimes when something bad happens in the fandom, haters will usually bring it up to the surface (i.e iFunny, reddit, facebook, etc.) What's especially worse is when meme pages get ahold of it, then it's popular, and everyone knows about it. To be honest I haven't seen too many issues in the fandom except what's obviously happened recently with k**o. And not only we get hate for stereotypes and shitty people in the fandom, but people just simply don't like us, and there's nothing we can really do about it :/

"Busy day at work so haven't had an opportunity to write back. The above is a MUCH less confrontational tone and will get you much more out of me than your previous tone.

I wouldn't say I am a subject matter expert. I simply speak from my experiences. I am not claiming I am an expert regarding the purification rundown, but I did see a number of people go through it and can speak specifically to the time they took and things like that. 

&gt; Do you believe that Narconon or Scientology would make an already confrontational personal more confrontational?

Yes I think so. At least Scientology would. The things studied in Narconon I do not believe would make someone more confrontational, but perhaps the environment would. Though I don't think a few weeks in that environment would be enough to cause that much change. However the culture of Scientology certainly does make one more confrontational. This is made worse if you are staff and even worse if you are Sea Org. Though whether that attitude remains after one leaves is up to the individual. I think many (or even most) ex members manage to leave that confrontational attitude in Scientology and revert to being a more compassionate and understanding person after leaving. Though I would not say that is a general rule or a certainty. 

&gt; My style has become more confrontational since Narconon.

Is it possible that this is less because of Narconon's specific environment and/or teachings and more because you are personally upset and angry about having been forced to participate in it? Is it possible that you are more confrontational because you are angry and are having a difficult time processing that anger toward Narconon and Scientology? I'm not making any claims of judgements here. I just find that there is a certain ""anger phase"" after leaving something like that. I went through it, others have too. And the length of that phase is different for each person regardless of how long one was involved with Scientology or one of it's front groups.

&gt; do you believe the sauna treatment in Scientology is the same in at Narconon? 

Yes as far as I know its the exact same program. It uses the exact same source material (Clear Body Clear Mind) and Scientology is big on doing things exactly as Hubbard said. So its unlikely that Narconon does some kind of modified program. Its most likely the exact same program, just called something different and presented as something different.

&gt; does Scientology have a reason to hide the fact these two sauna ""treatments"" are the same?

Absolutely. They attempt to claim that Narconon and their other front groups are not based on Scientology. They try and claim that they use materials from Hubbard but that they are not providing Scientology services. They do this so they can claim that these front groups are not related to Scientology and so they can continue to claim that Scientology is a religion while claiming that groups like Narconon are not religious in nature. Its all part of their public relations and legality issues. They are simply trying to rename and misrepresent things so they can play both sides of the field so to speak.

"Na verdade aplicativos e baladas são péssimos lugares para conhecer gente para relacionamentos mais duradouros.

Relacionamentos duradouros tipicamente não vêm de encontros aleatórios, mas de encontros promovidos por atividades e interesses comuns.

Por isso tantos casais se conheceram no trabalho, na faculdade, em uma atividade social, em um voluntariado, em uma militância, em um local religioso, em uma atividade musical, em um grupo de interesse qualquer, etc.

Se você quer relacionamentos mais duradouros e profundos, eu recomendo que comece a frequentar atividades relacionadas a assuntos que gosta e conhecer gente mais profundamente nesses lugares.

Pode ser um meetup, um curso, uma grupo de militância LGBT, grupo de caminhada silenciosa, grupo de fotografia, clube de xadrez, whatever. Algo que você gosta e que gera interação com pessoas novas.

Claro que sendo LGBT isso introduz dificuldades, porque você já tá com um ""público restrito"". Mas existem atividades em que existem mais LGBTs e em que eles são mais bem vindos. Isso pode ajudar.

Sobre transar no primeiro encontro, acho irrelevante. Se a pessoa não tá interessada em relacionamento, demorar mais pra transar não vai fazer ela querer. E daí além de ficar sem o relacionamento também vai ficar sem  o sexo. E não tem problema nenhum dar umas boas trepadas enquanto espera surgir alguém interessado em relacionamento.

Eu acho que o problema está em procurar em lugares em que existem poucos mecanismos de aprofundamento das relações humanas. Você tá procurando em lugares em que as pessoas não estão procurando relações profundas. 


Boa sorte!"

"You clearly dislike the CN region for some reason. Whenever a CN team loses they got outplayed ( for some reason you never name the play ) , when they win, the enemy draft was worse or you put the CN win in a bad light. Maybe jealous is the wrong word, but it is pretty obvious that you have something  against the CN region , which is absolutely fine, just don't deny it.  It is not a coincidence that you only appear here at certain moments and 90% you just refer to CN Dota, speaking negatively about it.  You do everything to put CN Dota in a bad light. Just copy paste all your posts and put them in one page. The mood of your posts is clear. 

Newbee not performing at TI was pretty obvious considering their 2nd half of the season ? No one really rated them , or did ""people "" really say so ? I really never read someone saying Newbee looking good going into TI or are top 8 team at all ? . Going into TI people used the meme that it will be CNs year , but it was pretty clear that LGD was the only top tier CN team. VG was too inconsistent overall ( but their season was pretty solid in general, not too bad overall across the whole season ). Imo  China wasn't the strongest region last season, but still the most competitive one in his own region. Overall 6 CN teams in top 18 and I think they were all rightly at TI. IG got eliminated in the gorups, but it was not like they were a complete garbage team compared to any other team from other regions who didn't make it to TI.  Next to the 6 TI teams ,there were still LFY, Keen and Ehome. That is what I mean with most competitive, which doesn'T mean strongest region directly. True that CN has a bigger player base and therefore there are more competitive teams, but most teams have 4+ CN players as well ,  other teams add players from other regions. Not to mention due to contract situation it is not as easy to get some players. Like EG getting FLY and S4 shortly before TI and improve. 

You had so many wrong posts already, having some right one isn't sth too special ? I am actually not only refering to the strength of CN region, but more like your general game analysis.  

Having a bad TI season is absolutely okay or ? You pretend as it is the end of the world and you seem to feel so happy , like you haven't anything in your life other than shitting on CN region. Anyone reading your posts will agree, you will agree. At the end of the day Dota is a competitive sports and anything can happen. Real Madrid not winning 5 games in a row in the PD, none  of the LCK teams in top 4 at worlds, Bayern Munich struggling , Leceister winning PL years ago . That is sport. 

CN had a worse TI, but imo their regular season has been better than before. Previously CN Dota was criticized for only showing up at TI and being bad in the whole season before. That definitely improved.

Often times you making sth up to create this hate towards CN. Best example was you saying VG was overrated by people yesterday after losing game 1 against EG would played a good drow lineup ( before they went 1:1 agaisnt a good Secret team ) . Again, where you you got this from ? Why you say this ? Were there really so many people overrating VG so it was worth posting it ? I don't think there was one single person overrating VG. 
Or why you don't just give credit for Asters win yesterday over VP ? Instead you just highlight that VP did fine with a lineup weaker after min 30 ( which you pretend is something set, but is acutally highly debatable and not as simple to say as explained by me) . Swap a western team with Aster and VP with LGD and you 100% wouldn't write it in favour of LGD like you did for VP. BTW, draft is a huge part of the game and also part of skill. So many using "" bad drafting"" as an excuse to feel better for their own team losing or to have one more reason to shit on the team he/she hates. 

Looking at your non Dota posts, it was about LOL, and what a surprise, about CN LOL in a negative way. 

Maybe it is not the case, but reading your posts it feels like your life is fine when CN sucks and your life sucks when CN is doing well. Kind of sad. That becomes most obvious when you only highlight CN teams getting outplayed ( definitely the case at times ) , but never mentions great plays by a CN team, or when they outplay the opponent ( like CN teams never did  it ?!). Not only CN Dota is overyhped, tons of many other players/teams/regions are overhyped. You either don't see it, or just don't want to see i and therefore never speak about these for some reason.

What I don't get is, that you keep shitting on CN Dota, when the minority here is speaking about CN Dota/ supporting CN Dota . I would understand it when this sub is full of  blind fanboys celebrating CN Dota, but that is not the case. Way more other blind fans overhyping other stuff .

Don't understand me wrong. Disliking a region, team, player is aboslutely fine. What is annoying to me is the onesided argumentation based on hate towards the CN region. 

Your doubt about CN strength is absolutely fine too as it is your opinion, but kind of weird that you are only here to make this point. Pretty interesting that you are basically only here speaking mostly about a region you dislike. 

I just used the word jealous unconcisouly ,probably  because I associate jealous people with those who play down someones achievements and celebrate failure of someone in particular or only appear here in certain moments of failure of someone."

"Except they're still not balanced. AT aside, gnomes basically don't *have* racials for PvE, and the Draenei heal is laughable at the best of times.

EMFH is awesome in some niche situations, which is fine.

Stone Skin is great if you're a tank.

Darkflight is basically fucking useless.

Shadowmeld is good for avoiding *some* repair bills, but otherwise Night Elves are as bad in PvE as they are in story.

Meanwhile...

Orcs get an active AND passive damage buffs depending on what class they pick.

Trolls get mini-lust.

Tauren get an AoE stun which is great everywhere BUT raid bosses.

Goblins and Forsaken basically have worthless racials, except for WotF which is about as useful in PvE as EMFH is.

Orcs, trolls, tauren, and blood elves are still big stand-outs because they all have active racial abilities that the alliance has no answer for. And it doesn't matter how effective these abilities *actually* are because the *perception* of these abilities is that they're amazing.

Alliance players will faction swap to take them, and horde players always get supremely defensive when you suggest nerfing them.

Alliance needs answers for Arcane Torrent, War Stomp, Blood Fury, and Berzerking. Without answers for them, we will forever be inferior in PvE."

Globalization (incl. migration) is still more efficiently lifting people up from poverty than foreign aid, and liberalizing countries way more efficiently than wars and other Cold War instrumental bullshit.

As far as imperialism is concerned, there are decent arguments that it was primarily toxic on the political level – by destroying local communities and institutions (incl. fundamental rights and freedoms). [Effects of colonial extractive institutions are visibly negative](http://www.nber.org/papers/w7771). [Depending on what type of institutions were set up, fortunes of many regions reversed](https://www.nber.org/papers/w8460). On a economic level however: exchanging technologies, goods, building infrastructure, establishing trade routes – many mostly good things happened. [Areas with greater exposure to European trade are more developed today.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18162) It's really easy to misconstrue what I'm saying, please read this charitably. All I'm saying is that if since the ""Age of Discovery"" history happened without the political warmongering bullshit, but with the same amount of global trade, things would be way different, and way better. Basically, different regions of the world should have always treated each other as equal partners."

"Lets look at these in a bit more detail....

* **Traits we inherited from our distant ancestors.** Obviously all species are a cumulation of inherited traits. Who we are today is largely due to who ""we"" were in the distant past. We inherited a strong tendency to be a very social species from our mammalian ancestry. Mammals are social beings, humans included. We inherited opposable thumbs from our early primate ancestors. Humans are not the only species with opposable thumbs so it is not a trait that is unique to our species. However, the inheritance of thumbs enabled us and the other primates to develop fine motor skills like precision grip. This enables us to manipulate objects, and make/modify tools. Humans also inherited an upright bipedal posture from our early ancestors. Humans are not the only bipedal species (after all, all birds are bipedal!) but our upright posture has given us many advantages, namely that it frees our hands to do other tasks.

* **Brain/body size ratio &amp; exceptional brain [gyrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrification)** is a somewhat useful indicator of how intelligence a species is. The correlation is decent among related mammal species, but it breaks down when applied to distantly related animals. It underestimates intelligence in heavy animals like horses and overestimates small animals like mice and birds. You also have to consider what the animal's brain has evolved for. Bird's typically have very large brains for their body but may not be exceptionally smart. A lot of that large bird brain is used for flight calculations and isn't available for higher level processing. Fruit flies have enormous brains compared to their mass, but that brain is simply too small to have any real thought processes. Humans are highly intelligent because they have an extremely large brain for their normal body mass and that brain has evolved specifically to perform complex thought. Size isn't the only factor, scientists also consider the degree of specialization, complexity of neural connections, and degree of brain gyrification. Humans score high on all these physical qualifiers associated with increased intelligence.

* **Two cognitive traits thought to be unique to humans** - *shared intentionality* and *cumulative culture*. Shared intentionality goes one step further than being able to solve problems as a group, it involves anticipating the needs of others and the situation in order to solve a common goal. This requires incredible foresight, flexibility, and problem solving skills. It requires an almost hyper-sociality group structure. We couldn't stick 100 chimpanzees on a plane and expect it to land in one piece...but you can stick 100 human strangers and all, for the most part, get along just fine. This level of cooperation is rarely seen among other animals (save for the Eusocial insects, naked mole rats, and perhaps Callitrichid monkeys)...my point is we have a shared intentionality that allows us to be hyper-social and cooperative. *Cumulative culture* goes beyond the cultures exhibited by other animals. Other animals have culture where [non-essential] traditions are passed on from one generation to the next and can be modified slowly over many generations. Humans also have traditions, but these are past on much more easily between individuals. Moreover, these traditions are quickly modified, almost unlimited times within a generation. We are able to rapidly build upon the ideas of others and modify these ideas to suit new problems. Moreover, our adults, as compared to the adults of other species, are much better at learning and retaining new skills or traditions. Generally speaking, the age old adage ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks"" applies well to the non-human animal kingdom and this is just another area where humans have broken away. So these two traits, *shared intentionality* and *cumulative culture*, led to the development of other aspects of our being which are unique (e.g language). Everything else that we can do is just a happy by-product of these two traits: being able to go to the moon, or build a super dam, or create art, or think in the abstract, complex maths, industrial agriculture...Those things are by-products of our level of cognition. Our uniqueness is derived from shared intentionality and cumulative culture plus a couple of random physical traits that we were lucky enough to inherit from our distant ancestors - a big brain, bipedalism, and opposable thumbs. These traits built the foundation for what was to come."

"To be fair, it's in Spotify's best interest (and other companies like them) to not announce features in advance.

By hiring the Snowy developer and him saying he was working on the wearables team at Spotify, they had sort of ""back door announced"" Apple Watch support—and so many people on the internet *expected* an Apple Watch app from Spotify. Due to circumstances out of their control (Apple removing the loophole in watchOS 4), Spotify couldn't deliver a watchOS app. How many people blamed Apple for that? How many people incorrectly blamed Spotify?

To address your other point, yes, it's been 4 months. But (pure speculation on my part) while Spotify is interested in offering a watchOS app, it might not be an immediate priority, meaning they didn't necessarily start right away on it after WWDC. Also, you've seen how passionate people are about watchOS support—to the point where Spotify needs to *nail it* the first time.

"As someone who has marked Australian JET SOPs several times:

I have said this before, but I cannot reiterate enough how SIMILAR most of the SOPs are, probably because they are all from either people just graduating or people just graduated.

1. I love Japan with all my pee pee

2. I got interested in Japan when I learned I loved anime/manga/video games/zen buddhism/the deep mystical Orientalism that is the inscrutable Japanese mind and/or culture.

3. I did some kind of generic Asian studies at university with no real idea of what that would be applicable to.

4. I spent six months in Kyoto or Osaka as part of my uni.

5. I want to improve my Japanese.

6. I want to travel around Japan a lot.

7. Squee, did I mention that when the word ""Japan"" is dropped in conversation I literally orgasm on the spot?

Be normal.  Be honest about why you are interested in Japan and the job.  It *is* good to show genuine interest in the culture and people, but don't go nuts.  Show that you understand it's a job and that you will be representing your country. Certainly talk about how you think it will help you in the future. Talk about what you can bring to the table.  Do you have a particular interest that you want to pursue in Japan or skills that could be of use (eg, play guitar in the classroom at elementary school, do judo, love art etc).

The biggest failing I saw was making it all about you and what you will get out of the whole deal. Of course it is great for you. It is effectively up to a 5 year almost vacation.  But they are spending a lot of money on you. What's in it for them?"
"That reminds me of my brother and I worry about him more than anyone else in my family and that's including my elderly grandparents. He is an excellent guy. He's incredibly kind and generous to a fault. He's charismatic and has a ton of friends but because I have experience playing the part I know how lonely he really is. When I say generous to a fault I mean that wholeheartedly. So many people take advantage of him, even our sister and father use him. When I visit I make a point to spend time with him doing whatever he wants. Mostly he just wants to chill and talk. And when I get up to leave he thanks me for staying. This wonderful guy with dozens of people who would consider themselves his friend actually *thanks me* for spending a few hours watching Westworld and not hitting him up for money or weed. It's like Robin Williams. It seems like the most depressed people put on a show to the world as if they go the extra mile to make sure no one is as sad as they are.

"The others explained the concept really well, so all I really have to add is one I'd avoid. There's a fic called Chasing the Shadow, and it touts itself as a 'semi-rational' fic. It really isn't. Naruto and Sasuke watch HunterXHunter which leads to Sasuke making the lightning god mode based off it, Haku's idea to make Hinata not be self conscious about seeing Haku and Naruto on a date is to have Hinata look at Haku's junk with the Byakugan instead of just telling her that he's a dude, and Sakura beats Gaara by transforming herself into a working cannonball and firing herself out of a cannon.

&amp;#x200B;

Now admittedly some parts were pretty good; Naruto's heritage as the Fourth's son is revealed from the very start so he lives with Sasuke, Ebisu trains Sasuke and Naruto before they join the Academy, and it is quite possibly the only Naruto/MaleHaku fic I've seen that lasts longer than three chapters."

"&gt; From my understanding, the goal of any organism is to mate and have offspring. This is supported by the theory of evolution and can be seen throughout pretty much all plants and animals.

Your problem here is equivocation regarding the word ""goal.""  There are 'evolutionary goals,' which are related to survival and reproduction.... but that's just because *the whole deal with evolution is survival and reproduction*.  But individual humans ALSO have goals for themselves personally, and those can be in line with 'evolutionary goals' or not.  IT's two entirely different things.

&gt; So, if having offspring is a primal instinct that is pre-programmed into our brains from birth, and if people who are gay were born like that (Common acceptance is that being gay isn’t a choice); then something must have gone wrong while the brain was developing...

Why do you say ""wrong?""  Can you justify your use of ""wrong"" to mean ""not in accordance with a primal species-level instinct?""


I'm a little perplexed by your understanding of mental disorders.  The only difference between a ""mental disorder"" and a ""trait' is that we've decided the former are mental disorders.  And usually the line is ""it causes distress for the individual.""  This has nothing to do with the way you seem to define it.

&gt; I just think it is hypocritical to believe people are born gay, but at the same time not classify it as a mental disorder.

Likewise, this confuses me.  If being gay was a mental disorder, it'd count as one whether you were born with it or not."

"1. Assuming I use glitches because I point out how common they are? Sure, Ok. I actually haven't used a glitch in Cod since the elevator days in MW2 back when trickshotting was a thing, so you'd lose that bet kiddo.

2. The same thing was said by the corresponding Dev team in every Cod, back in Infinite Warfare, Black Ops 3, WW2, as far as I can remember, and no one, at least on console has been banned in mass numbers. Steam, maybe, since it's much easier.

3. Here's a great tip, stop allowing glitches like these to pass through. It's not even like it's a difficult glitch. One is literally entered by rubbing alongside a wall...lol That shouldn't get by playtesting, but I guess I should expect no less here. Leave it to a desperate group of people to use them, and a Dev team who STILL haven't fixed any of the wallbreaches. God bless this Friday."

Doing what the app decides and sticking with it sounds hard but it also sounds like a great way to break that mindset of agonising and going back and forth, so I'll definitely look into it. 
And that's good there's a caveat for doing stuff you really want to do. Sometimes even if I really want to do something I get indecisive about whether it's a good idea to do it or even whether wanting it is a good idea (even when I do) and I've missed out on a lot of stuff I actually wanted because of that. So that's a good plan to force myself to just do it. Scary, but good.

"Oh fuck, didnt even notice. God, it has been a year, hasnt it?"
I grew up in a middle/upper middle class town in new England. There are poor people but not many and when i was a little kid there were even fewer. There was this older women that was nicknamed the quarter lady. She earned that name by asking anyone and everyone for a quarter. She would say she needed it for a cup of coffee or a cigarette. This was the early 80's so shit was cheap and you could buy loosies. Anyway if you offered to get her those things instead she would flip out and swear at you. I remeber one time my father caught her reaching into his truck to take his change. Mind you at this time we were part of that small group of poor people. This was obvious based on were we lived and my dads truck. Come to find out years later when she passed away i think she was a millionare at the least. Im pretty sure everyone knew she lived in a nice house to begin with but she was rollin those quarters for decades... I think he grave stone said Compound Interest j/k

"All of your documents from last cycle will also be available for the admissions office to see. Everything will get sent over from LSAC. Though they will be reading your F'19 application, all other documents you previously submitted may or may not get looked at as well. For that reason, be sure to not submit the same exact application twice (obviously some components will be the same and that's fine). Hopefully you've changed something significantly on your application  (like the LSAT score) to render a more positive decision for this cycle, most other factors being equal.

Regarding your second question, whether it looks good or bad to re-apply depends entirely on the initial decision and the circumstances surrounding it.  For example, some students are admitted in previous cycles but unable to attend due to a medical issue, deployment, personal reasons, or financial strain at the time of applying. While some of these reasons may warrant a deferral, others may not. (And depending on the school, deferral policies may be more or less strict.) Your situation may have changed this year that now allows you to follow through with enrollment. If that's the case, you'll want to address this in your application so that the admissions office knows if they offer you admission this year that you're likely to take it or at least seriously consider it. Alternatively, if you applied and were denied last year, I think it's perfectly fine to re-apply. It shows that you truly want to attend that particular school but, again, I'd hope something changes on your application to warrant a different decision this year. Don't submit the same exact application again and expect a different result.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope that helps! Good luck!

"Eh. I dont want to be a debbie downer, but spamming aerials with low landing lag was never completely what made melee melee. Melee is mostly a movement based game, and that movement facilitated combos because of how fast and precise it was, as well as how many options you had out of it (for example, wavedash being essentially a sliding neutral state so you have all options availible to you while you're in motion). 

It's faster than sm4sh for sure, but it's definitely no melee. It might just be lack of familiarity with the game for now, i could be completely wrong, but i find it kindof telling that the people who call the game melee hd are basically pretty much always primarily sm4sh players."

"Respectfully, it's not just one ""dumb"" radar beam returning on velocity number. It's actually a micro array that paints a radar ""picture"" and there's a good bit of DSP and logic going on. I don't have the video or white paper I read about it off hand, but the data processing adds delay. If the system is going to act under it's control laws, it has to reach a certain confidence level regarding it's limited inputs. 

If you have a 2016 or newer with this version if the radar, there is clearly a delay between when a car moves most of (to nearly all of) the way in your lane to when the display acknowledges it is present. This can vary depending upon the speed of the lane change.  On the other hand, it doesn't release the leading car until it's mostly all the way into another lane. It is clearly ""tracking"" objects, and knows how to differentiate between a car ahead in the next lane over and a car ahead in the same lane but offset because of a turn. Finally, it will disengage cruise mode if it sees an odd return signal (""just"" distance) that doesn't otherwise meet it's criteria for a trackable vehicle -- even if it's the same vehicle it was successfully tracking a split second before.

I don't know if the OP's car even noticed the Audi until it had already put more distance between them. By then it wasn't a threat. Maybe there's some ""emergency"" logic for really really _really_ close signal returns, but that hasn't been my experience. When the vehicle is _already locked_ by the radar, then it's very quick to respond to sudden deceleration or unsafe following distance."

My “swing thought” is to move my butt back to start the rep vs moving it down.  You don’t want to push your knees forward as that can cause you to move the bar too far forward over your feet.  As I start to squat heavy I also starting stretching my hamstrings and quads which has helped.  In my case I find a low bar squat a bit awkward but trying to move the bar down as far I comfortably can has helped.

"1. Format- Although nobody's ever going to ding you on format for the most part, recruiters spent 5-10 seconds on a resume and your ""professional summary"" is unnecessary. They should be able to get all that info from your resume without you having to say it. 
2. Education, do you not have a Bachelor's? How did you get a Master's then, include all education
3. Don't put Microsoft Office/Excel, it's assumed
4. For bullet points, you want to ask yourself ""so what"" with every bullet point. You should be able to demonstrate impact. Use the ""ACR"" format (Action, context and result) and try to quantify the result wherever possible.
5. As a vet, I realize that as a Marine to be awarded a NCM with Valor is a big deal, but normal people won't, so try to find a way to talk that up some more but also make it so people understand what it means
6. You spent 5 years in the Marines, I'm sure that you have more that you can talk about there

Overall, your resume isn't terrible. I think mostly I'd try to come up with more bullet points from your work experience. You also want every bullet point to convey some sort of skill/trait. It starts with the first word, Identified, engineered, participated, reduced...which I think yours are good, and then moves into conveying something whether that's leadership, technical expertise, organizational skills or whatever.

"Rap artists just collaborate more in general. There’s so many more features and collab albums because I feel like the industry is more tight knit and a lot of early rapping and hip hop was formed around parties. 

In early hip hop, DJs threw parties where they would scratch over records, and someone would rap over the beat. Oftentimes, this would lead to crew cuts or many performers at one event, and I feel like it’s just engrained in the culture. There’s also battle rapping and this competitive spirit that can lead to artists collaborating with verses that go back and forth, like Run The Jewels or Bad Meets Evil or Black Star.

Pop collaborations are becoming more of a norm, with groups like LSD popping up or something like The Hunger Games’ soundtrack with collab-heavy songs. Also, with the age of the internet, a lot of newcoming pop artists are finding that networking and getting popular works a lot like what SoundCloud rappers do to gain exposure - collaborate, collaborate, collaborate.

"&gt;First off, how difficult is it to find a job?

Its different for everyone. This is a question with a lot of factors involved, broad questions like this don't have simple answers.

&gt;Would it be best to apply for a company such as Google or Microsoft?

Its often a really good choice to work at Google or Microsoft.

&gt;Or would a video game company be best?

Video game companies are known for long hours and little reward.

&gt;Would working for a video game company be more fun?

Contrary to what you might think- most video game companies are usually less fun than other companies.

&gt;Is it just sit in front of a screen all day and type whatever you're told to type? Or is it more like a collaborative, sit around a table and brainstorm, creative design kind of thing?

Some of both. Coming up with good solutions to problems is not as simple as telling you to type it out. There is a lot of thought that goes into designing and creating software.

&gt;What's the average pay an hour? Is the pay decent for the work?

Again, many factors. Skilled office work usually starts at $20 an hour minimum in a lot of cheaper places. It can be as high as $60 per hour for really good candidates at the right companies.

I don't expect a 16 year old to understand job markets- but I do think you can start doing your research.

&gt;Would it be stay at home or sit in an office type deal?

Lot of places let you work from home frequently.

&gt;How much would it take up my free time? Because I also want to make room for music, art, and other hobbies.

Some places are strict 9 to 5. Others, like startups frequently are a project and deadline driven machine- expecting things to get done no matter what it takes (staying long nights, working weekends). Even at the most typical 9 to 5 place there can be a few times where something comes up and you really should stay slightly later.

"This is absolutely false. Dictatorships and oligarchies are common on both sides - like I said, authoritarianism has little, arguably nothing, to do with left vs right. Same is true with oligarchy. Just look at Putin for example - classic oligarch/dictator on the right wing.

I think I see what argument you're making - that ""small government"" makes autocracy impossible. But one should note a few things:

1. There are plenty of right wing movements that don't actually reduce the power of the government at all. Republicans in the US for example - they talk about it, but they never do, and they do what they can to consolidate power (stacking the courts with extremists and suppressing voters, as of today). They impose their drug wars and religious principles on the people. They increase the power and size of the military. They aren't really a party of freedom as much as they pretend to be.
2. ""Big government"" doesn't make autocracy inevitable by a long shot, especially when the focus is on distributed government / democracy with a social safety net. See most of northern Europe.
3. ""Small government"" doesn't make autocracy impossible by a long shot either. It can actually be a way to consolidate power into the hands of the few. Sure, you may have gutted bureacracy and social programs, but you may also have gutted your checks and balances while keeping the full force of the military intact."

"You're a fan. You pay to make these athletes rich, and to watch them compete. When you're unsure about something, you use google and anecdotes to shape your opinion on how an athlete must think about topics. If two greats like him and Russell are trash-talking eachother on the golf course, that must be definitive proof of arguments that they're making with eachother. Hell, when I'm playing ping pong with my brother and start trash talking to get on his nerves, that must mean my statements are my true feelings as well. Our competitive nature makes us behave a certain way towards people sometimes, but that doesn't mean its what we truly believe if we're rational and being the most honest with ourselves.

Look, I'm not making any argument on whether he's being completely honest or not. Because just like you, I don't definitively know one way or another. When he came to LA in 96, he saw me holding a sign as a kid that said 'Magic Johnson is the best MJ'  when he was walking from his bus, and when walking by he literally looked over to me and said 'He very well might be' and continued walking with his security. Was he being genuine? Was he hiding his true feelings? Who knows, but the point is that we don't like when others judge us based off things they've heard, so we shouldn't make blanket statements trying to paint others as something when we've never personally interacted much with them outside of just being a fans of a sport.

I don't remember exactly what the event was, but it was specifically meant for the gay community so there were a lot of gay couples there.

Anyway, the next week I went into school and said that my friend's parents took me to a gay club. I guess by the time it got to my friends parents, the story became that I said they took me to a gay STRIP club. They took some flak from the school and other parents and I was made to apologize to them. But I didn't say anything in a negative way, I had a wonderful time! 

Anyway, there was no love lost between my friend and I, we're still amazing friends 15 years later. However, his parents and my parents were very close friends before that incident and have hardly spoke in all this time, and my relationship with them is still a bit strained. "

"Three things in what you just said. First, creating 165 is not mutually exclusive with keeping 125. Second, merging 125 and 135 is particularly problematic because at that size the extra 10 pounds is significant. A lot of natural 125ers (including DJ) aren't necessarily capable of fighting as well at 135, and a fair few 125ers are already pretty small for the div. Third, I don't think decisions that are good for the sport are necessarily the same decisions as what is 'good business'. We already know that making fights based on rankings isn't always profitable (e.g. them wanting to give Lesnar a title shot based off of 2 losses, a NC due to PED suspension, and having not won a fight in 8 years). I think that making decisions purely based on finances can definitely lead to negative outcomes for the sport itself, and similarly shutting down a division and having half the fighters split between different orgs means that we miss out on a lot of match ups."

I'm looking for other places to go to like the one I mentioned, if you guys know. I've been to Black Market before but the vibe isn't just for me and certainly not on a Saturday. The place feels more of a place for party animals rather than a place for those genuinely into the music (such woke)."

A new tank is easy. Once the tank ages things can change tanks can crash salt water tanks are more prone to this.

I agree it's nice I love reefkeeping but.... it's much pricier and more involved than fresh water , or even a fish only with live rock tank.

I'm not saying this to discourage anyone , just to discourage impulse buying ...  especially when people are calling out the tang police etc in this post and the OP IS PLANNING to upgrade the tank.   

A lesson I learned young in the hobby...  buy your equipment get your environment right and then buy your livestock .  I'm not saying you can't do it like this but you're new to salt water and have a tang in a minireef of course someone will say something ."

"I procrastinated all the way through my sophomore year of college. At the beginning of my junior year I had a paper that was due that I knew I was going to struggle with. My professor told me that if I finished it early she would go over it with me and tell me what I needed to correct so that I could have it fixed before it was due. Finished early, we went over it, I made all the corrections, got a 100 on it. Tried this out for a different class. Finished early, went during office hours, got corrections, got a 98. After that I finished all papers/large assignments at least a week early and worked out corrections with my professors. Never got lower than a 96 on a paper for the rest of my college career. I made the Dean’s list all 4 of those semesters and seriously raised my GPA. (Having corrected papers helped me retain information and study better for exams.)"

The guys you’d be having sex with won’t judge you for having sex with them, but if your count is higher than theirs, and they balk at that- then they’re feeling fragile and not the “stud” of the relationship. If such perceptions matter, they’re going to have a lot of other BS hang ups. 

My fiancé and I have comparable partner counts, high 40’s. Neither of us care, we came into the relationship knowing what we wanted, how we can achieve orgasms, and what we want in a partner sexually.

"I'm guessing you're young, probably senior year in high school or maybe just out? If you don't have much of a credit history or any rental history, you might have to put deposits down for utilities. Landlords in college towns may or may not have bigger requirements for security deposits (such as first, last, AND security deposit down, instead of just some combination of those.) 

You'll have general moving expenses, plus the cost of furnishing an apartment/dorm. Inexplicably, no matter how well you plan, there will be SOMETHING you have to run out and get that first week. Plunger, extension cord, fan, light bulbs, blinds for the bathroom window. Things could get broken or go missing in the move. My very first apartment, I had to make an IKEA run the first night, because we had canned soup planned for dinner and as it turned out, neither of us owned a can opener. There is ALWAYS something. I would include a basic toolkit in there, because while you can and should definitely call your landlord if your plumbing leaks or there's a weird gas smell, you'll still have to assemble/maintain your own furniture, hang any artwork (following your lease agreement, of course!) and such. Don't forget cleaning supplies as well -- durable things, like a broom and mop, as well as consumable, like trash bags and a cleaner for scrubbing down your shower.

Your car insurance will likely change as they take into account what zip code you're living in. It'll also probably be a lot more expensive if you are no longer on your parents' plan. 

You'll probably want to budget a little extra in your food budget for the first month or two as you pick up those pantry essentials to start -- spices, things like flour and sugar, staples that stay good for ages like peanut butter or pantry essentials like canned tomatoes and things that are basic meal starters for everything, etc. You don't want to go overboard on those and get a ton of things you won't ever use, but it's super annoying to try to cook your dinner and then realize you don't own any salt. Not that I've ever had that happen to me. Ahem. 

It's been a minute since I've had to use a laundromat/apartment laundry so they might accept cards now, but one apartment I lived in required quarters for laundry and did not have a bill changer. If it's going to be inconvenient to get cash in your new town (maybe you bank with a local credit union and will get hit with fees for using ATMs?) you might want to change $20 or so into quarters before you go if it looks like this will be an issue.

"You say that voice acting is bland, but I think you actually meant that the writing is bland rather than the voice acting. Voice actors are paid rather highly in the context of the anime industry, and are often trained and quite talented, sometimes seen equal to idols. Speaking of writing in the show, you say that the banter at times feels like a teenager's idea of clever comebacks, yet the main characters are all teenagers, so I have to assume that this one line here serves no objective purpose in your evaluation.

You write of lazy animation and unimpressive backgrounds, yet in the context of making the backgrounds, this is about as good as it gets because of the setting, and the animation for the background characters of most shows are not meant to be particularly special in any sense. 

Lastly, you don't really mention why being average is offensive, why a show that does its job of appealing to the audience it wants to appeal to and then some is offensive.

For a show like this, production values are going to be average because the setting is set right in the middle of our everyday lives, and thus there will be little to no room for finding ways to stand out, so the main focus will be on the story and the characters."

After awhile it would not be interesting (which is the point - their lives are just as boring as everyone else’s) and they would probably leave.

I was thinking of it more in terms of a supportive community that would understand, relate to, and accept your shame and regrets as well as providing a spirituality (the twelve-step spirituality) for a way to making amends, forgiving yourself, and ultimately finding meaning again."

"Firstly I'm a woman, so that's the perspective from which I'm writing this. There's a level on which I can understand this, but I suppose it depends on the physical appearance of each of the partners in the relationship when it started and how much importance you place on those things as opposed to intellectual attractiveness, humor, conversation, respect, generosity and the other things that make up the foundation of a lasting relationship. When my BF and I got together, we were both at our heaviest (about 12 years ago) we both lost a bunch of weight at different times in the relationship for different reasons. I put all of mine back on after moving in with him and his 3 kids and going through menopause (it wreaks havoc with your body and is NOT fun). He's gained some back just because he kept getting hurt at the gym and stopped going. I don't care how much he weighs because I fell in love with the person he is to begin with. He may not be physically attracted to me anymore but hasn't said so. But it would crush me to think that he would be so shallow that the rest of our life would mean so little. Reprioritize or let her go."

"It is almost a guarentee that we don't all see colors the same way. There is no such thing as ""red"" or ""black"" or any color. There are just the wavelength of light which hit your eye and which your brain then interprets a certain way based on the way your eyes and neurons work. The same wavelengths will hit the eyes of, for example, a cat, and be percieved differently. Most humans likely have a similar interpretation of these wavelengths, but there is no way to know for sure.

"Algebra is one of those things where you learn incrementally, meaning, you MUST know step 1 before you go on to step 2. Learn the basics of the basics before you worry about the harder stuff. This may be tough because your class might be ahead of where you need to be, but if you're getting tutoring like you say you are, this shouldn't be an issue.

Also, when you're being tutored, ASK QUESTIONS. Don't sit there and nod in hopes of them moving on and ending the session so you can go home. Learning something you don't want to sucks - but unfortunately it has to be done sometimes. If you don't understand a concept, tell the teacher you don't understand, quickly, before they move on to something even harder. Then, when they say ""What part of it do you not understand"", that's when you say, ""NONE OF IT."" If they can't help you learn from there, they are not the teacher for you. Remember, it is their JOB to TEACH YOU. If you are not learning algebra (but you are trying) then chances are you have a lazy, incompetent teacher.

I failed algebra Freshman year, like you, but retook it Sophomore year and passed with a 106% first semester and 100% second semester. What this told me is that my Freshman teacher was complete ass; I just needed a better source to learn from.. Hopefully the same is true for you! Best of luck."

"Game theory is absolutely an active area of economics.

I never watched the original Speed Racer cartoon show as a kid, it was beyond my time. By the time I gave it a shot it just seemed a tad too quaint for me. My mom was a big fan of it though, and would tell me how she and her sisters would always watch it as a kid, always getting hooked for the next episode. Naturally, I took my mom to watch Speed Racer on opening night. I don't remember if she actually liked it, but she did tell me that ""it was just as she remembered the original show."" Maybe the film does manage capture some kind of sense of indelible nostalgia for it."

"I was asking a rhetorical question (like /u/Asmin99 was).  They don't actually like Voldemort or Bellatrix and are asking to make a point, so obviously I don't have any questions about them relating to Voldemort.

There are certainly some who need to be prison for the safety of others, but they are a minority of those currently in prison, and most of the people who should be in prison should only be there for, say, a third or a fifth of the time they will do. This is true for crimes of extreme violence, too -- not just drug possession or street dealing. Too many people are in prison for gun possession, violent assaults, robberies, attempted and actual murders.

This all has little to do with evil vindictive prosecutors and more to do with apathetic prosecutors that put their 9-5 in front of the damage. Most prosecutors I know may see a little bit of truth to this stuff but stop short of admitting most of the cases I've described should result in substantially less incarceration. But I would bet almost every prosecutor in a big city in America has had a few cases where they thought, ""Damn, this is fucked up that this defendant is going to prison for so long. But oh well, I'm just following the guidelines."" And that alone is a serious, horrible moral failing on their part.

"&gt; I think maybe a dozen or so of them could be considered relevant. 

What number would it have to be for you to consider it a significant amount? Would a dozen sick searches not help a jury see what kind of sick, twisted interests the defendant has?

&gt; Motive alone does not prove anything.

You're right. Nobody is arguing that this would have ""proved"" anything by itself though. The state used plenty of individual pieces of evidence, but none of them proved anything by themselves either. They're part of a whole, and there's no good reason they wouldn't like to make that ""whole"" as big as possible by adding even more evidence to it... unless they were using it to blackmail BoD.

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, we are talking about the same investigators that didn't find any of Steven Avery's fingerprints in the Rav4 yet thought it was normal he left his own blood in some places and not others. Although I'm sure they figured it's because this is the same Steven Avery who is clever enough at cleaning a garage of all blood DNA from a gunshot wound to the head while leaving it dirty enough to not raise any suspicion.

Wonder where he picked those skills up living in a dirty trailer."

My question...I’m not sure if I got them small enough. I usually wear a 9/9.5, so I ordered an 8.  A while back, I tried them on in the store, and thought the 8 felt good. But now that I’ve been wearing them for a while, I’m wondering if I should have gone down to a 7.5.

Maybe I’m just overthinking it. I’ve read so much about them stretching, I’m getting paranoid. When I put on the 8s I just received, the sides felt snug. Now, an hour into it, they’ve loosened up a bit. I also have a nice amount of wiggle room in the toe box. That said, if I got a 7.5, I think my toes would be hitting the front (or would be very close). Along the laces feels tight, particularly when I bend my foot upward.

They’re a pretty big investment. I want to make sure I do everything right. Any thoughts?"

"Assuming you mean any kind of EoC I'd recommend starting with revolution on your basic abilities with [these bars](https://runescape.wiki/w/Revolution/Bars) and learning when to activate your ultimates and thresholds. Slowly easing into it I think is the key to not getting overwhelmed and being actually familiar with your keybinds. Keybind everything you can, but not everything at once. Once you know ultimates and thresholds, start learning about defensives. At gwd2 vindicta and helwyr both are great at learning how resonance works, at vindicta you resonance the ranged hits and at helwyr the ""you will bleed"". Both significantly increase the time you can stay before having to bank. 

If you want to learn the rest of the defensives start trying to learn tank roles like pet tanks then base tank at beastmaster, it'll get you used to hitting lots of different keybinds in different situations. 

Revolution is fine for all this content but once you want to learn manual it'll be the same kind of step up. I think junesong's dps guides are a good guide to manually activating your basics, but I'm lazy and have done everything up to aod with revolution on my basics. "

JD Power is a marketing firm. Companies pay them and commission a survey. Companies also, after having received an award have to pay to display the award and logo on commercials. Also the awards are usually for things like ""initial quality"" and ""features"", which is nothing that's really important when buying a new car.

My mind may have been wrapped as I listen to these a lot during revision - Golds use of texture, ornamentation and down right 100% utilisation of the orchestra helped portray the grandeur of Who, and for me - it worked."

"tl;dr -- It seems to me that Kushner owes favors to MBS as the latter arranged a line of credit for K. from HBJ &amp; others.

It seems to me that when we connect the dots, Kushner is looking more and more as if he's got blood on his hands...

- Jared Kushner was in debt to the KSR for arranging a line of credit of $900,000,000.

- MSNBC reported that Kushner owed 1 BILLION dollars in loans for his '666' Building in Manhattan on 07/02/2017

- Kushner ultimately got a loan from Qatar's ex-PM HBJ, who  agreed to invest at least $500 million through Al Mirqab, on the condition that Kushner Companies could raise the rest of a multibillion refinancing elsewhere. 

- We don't yet have proof (or do we?), but it seems to me that HBJ responded to overtures from MBS. Naturally, Kushner owes MBS in favors as well as money. Without MBS, Kushner didn't have the line of credit he needed to offload 666 on August 3rd 2018."

On a serious note, I have basically zero interest or hype for Ultimate. There is a negative chance that it's anywhere near as interesting to watch and play competetively as Melee, because Sakurai has given no indication that he's going to deviate from his track record since Brawl.

"Try not to worry about what their letter grade should be when grading/assessing and instead try to figure out how well they understand the content. I've worked with standards grading in classes that are structured around specific objectives which works well because on the assessments it's very clear what the focus is, and it's not too broad to the point where there's too much to try to assess holistically. 

The class I worked with (in math) described the categories like:
4- I understand it so well that I can teach/explain it to others. (They key here was being able to explain why things worked)
3- I understand how to do most problems but don't quite understand why things work or how to apply everything.
2- I'm starting to get it but still need some help on problems
1- I really don't know how to get through problems without assistance 
0- No evidence of learning shown

If you think about the traditional scale, it really doesn't tell you as much as you think. For example, what do you really know about a student's achievement if they got an 82%? What's the significance of having an 84 as opposed to an 82? Especially when a lot of grades include completion based assignments, a lot of passing comes down to showing up and doing the work, not how well you've actually mastered it. I think SBG is definitely an improvement in that aspect."

Other than that, I would stay I remained ""aware"" the entire time. I don't think it did much to me other than immediately upon waking, I went right to Amazon and bought every single PINK thing I could find ;) Just kiddin' but honestly, it was nice and I look forward to more sessions in the future.

My gut tells me that many, many people supporting Trump have broken the law... both before and during the 2016 election. I'm hesitant to say that Trump himself took any direct part in the law breaking, but I feel very confident that Don Jr knowingly broke the law. I think president Trump is, if anything, guilty of attempting to keep information away from investigators and lying about it. 

My gut tells me that many of Trump's early administration could go to jail, mostly for perjury and obstruction. I also think Don Jr is in pretty serious trouble because he was so vocal and lied a lot about the (obviously) illegal Trump Tower meeting.  "

"I think your response was perfect. She asked for the break up, now you put her on hold while you take some time. She shouldn't be allowed to, especially at this moment in time, pop in and out of your life as she pleases.

I think some space and time apart will help you and also show her by action that she can't do that to you.

I will always remember the best thing I ever did to get through a tough time with a girl. We took a break and I took the time to write all my feelings and things I wanted to say to her so badly on paper only. Then I hid it from myself and vowed not to speak to her for a month, no phone, no face to face, no text, no nothing. After the month was over I looked at what I wrote on paper and it was disgusting, I was pathetic. I crumpled it up, threw it away, and realized that was it. I was over her. I didn't really have anything to say to her. I read that idea in a book and it really helped me. The idea is after the month of not talking to the person if you read what you wanted to say to her and you realize you still have feelings and want to reach out then maybe it is meant to be after all, but in my case it showed me I did not want to rekindle the relationship.

Not sure if that is helpful at all. But thought I would share! Maybe if not now, then sometime later in life even.

P.s. since then I have talked to her, it's not like I was cold and heartless. We have had short friendly conversations some time later. But, I needed get my feelings in check before I could handle that."

Have you factory reset this one? That can do wonders. 

Quite a few commonly used routers/modems in north america use the Intel Puma 6 chipset which is just broken for gaming. Ping spikes and packet loss being the main issues. The web page for the [class action lawsuit](https://www.classactionlawyers.com/puma6/) against ISPs that sold these have a good list of them. Even more used it, but these are the most common. Make sure your new router is not one of those, but please report back with make and model so we can check.

"The big problem with personal loot is that it breaks the connection between the player and the guild. From a purely personal or selfish perspective on the player, it's great for the player. After all, who needs a guild when I can just pug raids and get loot? On a longer time scale, it greatly accelerates the gearing up process for the raid which means that content is completed much faster.

LC and DKP and other various loot systems all have drawbacks but, at their core, they work best when everyone in the guild is on the ""same page"" and prioritize guild progression over getting loot.

There was a guild on my old server that used loot council and basically divided the raiding playerbase into two groups... those who loot for raids, and those who raid for loot.

If you're the second type and are raiding basically to get loot, then that's cancerous to guild harmony and personal loot was made for you. But if you're the first type, those who want loot so they can raid, then ultimately you don't give a shit about loot drops as long as you are killing bosses. Those players will thrive under a LC system and generally are the types that are regulars in progression guilds."

"They can't make you leave before your lease is up. (Unless it has a clause that you agreed to, stating you will move out early for renovations, or, if they say so, which is ridiculous and unlikely but check). You (and your roommate) are legally responsible for paying rent until the 15 months are up. If you and the managers agree to end the lease early with no penalty, then that just ends the lease and your roommate would be off the hook. 

I'd tell them, sorry no can do, we're here until May. They will probably offer you some money to move and it's up to you to negotiate whatever you can. Of course how much hardball you want to play depends on how badly you want to move back in, so that's up to you. But the law/lease is on your side here. 

Also if you need something extra to negotiate with, Indiana requires property managers to be licensed with the real estate board. Unilaterally ending your lease early is illegal, so you would have a valid complaint against them if you chose to file one. "

"You should go talk to someone in career services. This is literally their job.

IANACA*, but depending on what field in finance you want to go into, not having an internship in that field could be a serious disadvantage for you in recruiting. For example, big investment banks recruit students spring semester of sophomore year for internships after their junior year, which are expected to lead to full-time offers. And recruiting for next summer, for most of the major financial services firms, is wrapping up now. Lots of recruiting activity also takes place through clubs, by the way--while employers are told to post opportunities on Handshake, some of them just reach out to clubs to get the resumes of club members and then contact people directly based on their resume. 

*I am not a career advisor

You're correct that you're the only person who can ultimately decide whether having no student loans is worth it to you, but you should talk to someone who can help you assess whether that is, really, what you want, or whether your admirable desire to avoid having student loans (which, while not fun, are not the worst, especially  if you're in finance and you have a higher than average salary) is hampering your ability to pursue what you want to do in the longer term.

Only take out the AR if you're going to increase the length of the effective barrel. Springer cylinder barrels are tight in the back half and loose in the front. The dart holds the AR open while it's in the tight part. Once in the loose section of the barrel air is escaping around the dart. If you add brass to the front of the cylinder or use a tighter 3d printed cylinder take out the AR.

"He was *far* from the only person to have doubts, and as someone else who thought it was bullshit the second I saw it, it was more based on the look of the 'cuts' (if they can even be called that) than anything else.

Although, it also reeks of a fake hate crime for other reasons. I don't know how many genuine hate crimes have involved writing slurs or hate symbols on people, but I've heard it in more than a few false ones, like Tawana Brawley for example. Even most of the stories I've heard in the news of slurs being written on homes and churches have ended up being false. Most genuine racist attacks seem to be much more violent, rather than putting a focus on optics while not actually remotely harming the victim. 

The main point I'm trying to make is that even though you didn't see anything about this case that jumped out to you as questionable, that doesn't mean that it's fair to label /u/hastur77  and others who did have doubts as ""sick"".

"The smaller room might work well. If you could budgie-proof it, it might feel safe enough for them to come out for a fly-around sometimes.  

I've never been a fan of the laying arms in the cage thing. It teaches them they have nowhere they can go to get away from you, not even their cage. We all feel more secure having a little sanctuary. I believe budgies gain more confidence in people when they have a safe retreat where humans do not intrude except to change food/water/toys and do necessary maintenance.   

If you want to keep working with them, try outside the cage only, talking in a cheerful voice, making interesting noises, singing, not staring at them, and just try to make progress getting a bit closer over time, even if progress seems miniscule.   

If you can get close enough to offer millet through the bars they will probably warm up to you faster after that, but it does take a loooong time with some birds.

"That would make sense if we were talking about strength of schedule, but not strength of victory. 

Oakland has one win, against the 3-2-1 Packers.

Point being that it’s just a ham-fisted statistic that doesn’t mean much.

If you wanted to, you could give a team a score for each win based on opponents record (so beating a .500 team is worth .5 points). That would at least account for the different win counts. 

But even then, it’s a weird stat, because it’s completely discounts the strength of schedule of the defeated teams. It’s saying, “Hey not all wins and losses are equal, so let’s try to to differentiate them using this strategy that treats all wins and losses as equal.”

"&gt;HEALERS - You will be DPSing. A lot. At higher levels, you'll be DPSing more than you'll be healing.  
&gt;  
&gt;TANKS - You will be DPSing. A lot. At higher levels, you will minimize your time spent in your tanking stance at all.

This is not factually true.

This is only true in END GAME - like Omega as a whole. I'd argue also basically every boss fight in general, but that varies on how often randoms are getting hit by shit. Most are NOT good at dodging.

However, at ""high levels"" such as Expert Dungeon roulettes, you WILL be healing more than DPSing if your tank isn't shit and they're doing as large of pulls as they can handle. You shouldn't have time to DPS if they're pulling enough. 30-49 it's definitely true. Having a proper healing ""Job"" things get a lot easier. But then the big pulls really start at 50.

On that same note, tanks in dungeons should be pulling so much that they NEED to be in tank stance. The exception being on boss fights in which you can generally start off in tank stance, do one or two aggro combos, go back to DPS stance and be fine for the rest of the fight."

"That was definitely true in George Orwell's time to be sure, but I meant ""originally"" when I said it. From the [encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/nationalism)

\[Nationalism\] stressed the particular and [parochial](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parochial), the differences, and the national individualities. Those tendencies became more pronounced as nationalism developed. **Its less attractive characteristics were not at first apparent**. In the 17th and 18th centuries the common standards of Western civilization, the regard for the universally human, the faith in reason (one and the same everywhere) as well as in common sense, the survival of Christian and [Stoic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Stoic) traditions—all of these were still too strong to allow nationalism to develop fully and to disrupt society

"I've been being helped by this acquaintance for a small amount of time now, I had given them some money to help them make rent and in return I've been sleeping on their floor. I'm waiting for my passport to come in the mail that was shipped that will be my proof of ID and documents to change my residency. When I have all of those things lined up, I'll be better able to manage climbing out of this hole, but I'm extremely anxious as I know I will still be on the bottom rungs of society regardless.

I'm afraid of workplace sexual violence as I've been perpetrated in workplaces constantly for the past 7 years and have only been safe in my workplace in one location and that was all the way across on the other side of the country.

Thanks for the message and the words of advice and I'm thankful for your words of encouragement to help me through this difficult time; I'm still really lonely and honestly slightly afraid and untrusting of the whole world around me; I hope through me continuing to fight for my own safety that I can help others whom go through the same struggles in and of the same.

I just want to find somewhere safe and peaceful and I want to raise my children I've been separated from and be with my wife whom I've never been together with in the current lives we're both living. My confirmed diagnosis of PTSD further validates my testimony against many whom have perpetrated me and caused me to sink so low in our society because of my mental illness and further self deprecating behaviors I've become accustomed to from childhood. 

I want that happy ending to a tragic love story and I know I have to keep struggling in order to get there and that reality is just ever painful and I wish life didn't have to be so painful and agonizing."

"The incentives used were available to all private businesses. I know this because my company came to Louisville for this very reason. This was not something special for just the Ark. Also there were never any lawsuits because it simply didn't break the law. Also, they had to do two feasibility studies and they showed that this would add a ton of jobs and money to an area of the state that honestly needs it. 

Trust me, I'm not saying it turned out to be a good decision to move forward yet I'd it treated this business differently than any other a lawsuit would have been filed against Kentucky gov by this goofball and he would have won. Simple as that.  I am just tired of atheist bitching about this and showing they do not really understand what separation of church and state really is and trying to make my state look like backwards fucks on something we are innocent on.

"Of course dude, It's nice hearing from you too. Lucky this is a solid community and you can always express yourself here. Weird to here a professional just thought you would be set all that shit going on. 

&gt;I have done soo much to tell my anxiety to fuck off , meditation, working out , eating better, getting a job and sticking with it for two years, writing three positive things I’ve done each day and many more.

You have no idea how much this home for me. I did the same shit -mediation, gym, diet, yoga, reading etc.  I finally realized that no matter how much I work on myself, if I don't open up to other people it won't matter.  Imagine you're trying to be an amazing boxer by only working out, hitting dummies, eating right, etc. You can perfect all of these things that are within your little bubble, but if you never actually train against people, you're never going to win. Same thing with this shit. I've actually studied public health in college, and one of most (if not the most) fundamental aspect of a healthy life is a strong social network. The good thing is that when you work on this, you'll already have all of that other shit that you worked on earlier -  the shit so many people these days are missing. You'll be able to get whatever you want, *trust me.* You have the drive I can tell. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is your relationship with your mom/friend relivable? Maybe that could be a place to start. There are some amazing people out there to meet too, I found a second family through competitive gaming. Like I said I know it's hard as shit to find a community/friends like this, but I *promise* these people are out there.  It's all about being super proactive and participating in literally *anything* that might *possibly* interest you. Concerts, conventions, gaming tournaments, etc. You name an interest, there's almost certainly some kind of event for on Facebook (at least in the city). If you have socially anxiety like me, that could be a good focus for therapy. A lot of cognitive therapy is centered around breaking up fears into little bits. Challenge yourself to make eye contact with one person, maybe the next day you smile at someone. Maybe you smile and wave the next day, then make a quick comment on the weather the next, ask someone how their day is going, etc. Maybe you don't struggle with this stuff but I know I do and I'd be happy to go into more detail another time.

"Most training plans have a mix of long runs and fast runs.  Eventually you want a long fast run, but you have to work your way up to that.  In your case, maybe 3 miles at a comfortable pace and the next day repeated 400m or 800m intervals at faster pace. That strengthens your fast twitch and slow twitch muscles and builds up endurance.  Something like the Couch to 5K or Couch to 10K since you're already running 5K's would include that and it'd be good to go through just to get used to it.

Regarding the strength training, actually I do strength + run most days. If I'm going to do a long run I'll probably skip the weights, but then some days I mostly do upper and lower body and only run for a mile.   I don't have any organized system for that: I just have a limited amount of time so adjust accordingly, lol."

He was also doing the dirty work and wasn't a coward in any of the confrontations. The finale by far and large the best out of any show until DD season 3 arrived.

"Definitely keep going with the diet thing. You can try cutting down on certain food groups to see whether or not there is something specific you may have an intolerance to (for me it was dairy). I would also recommend seeing a dermatologist and in the meantime find a moisturiser that works for you (I assume you don’t use one since it wasn’t mentioned?) it’s important to moisturise after washing your face even if you have super oily skin as if you don’t you’re just essentially stripping your face of its natural oils and then by not putting moisture back in forcing your skin to over produce oil.  You can have a look around, if I were you I would go for a moisturiser geared towards sensitive skin or just a gentle/mild one "

"Seems like a lot of people suggesting these jobs should be done only by Americans come from the same point of view that minimum wage rates shouldn’t be raised.

That’s sort of a moot point though. Americans really don’t want these grueling, back breaking jobs like picking fruit all days in the blazing sun. That’s been the case for years, and even higher paying farmers have expressed frustration at finding Americans willing to perform these jobs.

I would also argue that if these people could be utilized legally like in our guest worker programs, their income taxes could be readily collected. If employers are unable to legally list them on payroll, the unintended consequence is that they get paid off the record and no income tax is realized.

The economy is strong, moderately skilled labor is in high, almost desperate demand. Things like construction projects already cost more because architects/engineers/contractors are doing them on overtime and have lots of other work on the books. The reality is that 5000 migrants in these caravans, or even 100,000 migrants over a year, do not have a tangible impact on our economy once they spread out away from the border states.  If anything, it helps our economy out. Things are cheaper when businesses are forced to compete. If demand is high and labor is short, things cost more.

There just isn’t a compelling economic reason to insist immigration and guest worker programs should be eliminated or significantly downsized."

"Autocrossing is like the last place to brag about lopsided ""wins"". It's tacky and just comes off as unsportsmanlike. Autocross is supposed to be all about the driver rather than the equipment. This is honestly a key part of autocrossing. It creates a really welcoming culture that invites new people to take part no matter what car they have. Imagine pulling up to your first autocross in your base mustang and you see this guy openly tallying up and displaying his wins against you to everyone else at the event in his model 3 that cost twice as much as your car. How would that make you feel?  That would create a toxic culture and would discourage anyone from coming back again.


If you're more concerned about how fast you are compared to other completely different cars rather than improving your own times, you are doing it wrong.


I'd be more impressed by someone showing up in a Prius and setting consistent quick times for its class than an expensive, fast car feeling the need to flex about beating a fiesta ST or something."
"The proof author unfortunately never emailed me (OP of the 4chan threads), or posted to the google doc, or anything. Reading [original thread with the proof](https://warosu.org/sci/thread/3751105) and [the follow up](https://warosu.org/sci/thread/3734198) it almost looks like they took up the tripcode !MnRMOBEIRw  mid thread. But it's difficult to tell as 4chan's layout isn't tree like, and most posters are anonymous. If that tripcode poster was the proof author, at least there is some form of verification. Someone just needs to be able to produce the tripcode hash MnRMOBEIRw  to prove it's them.

EDIT: nvm I mixed up the order of the threads, how fitting. It's probably not that poster, as the anonymous post came after the tripcode user started posting."

"I do not think this is a very good critique of a series. (And this is coming from someone that thinks the anime is worse than just ""bad"") You need to be able to back up your opinions instead of just streamlining through your issues with the series.

This is an example of a hollow critique:

&gt;In some ways, ""average"" series, that are competent but with zero ambition or flair, are more offensive than things that are painfully awful.

Sure, you're giving your opinion, but there is no flesh to your argument and you're simply just stating that the series as a whole is ""average"" without giving any context.

These are your most detailed statements and even then, they aren't supported fully:

&gt; the animation of background characters is lazy without having any noticeable or memorable style to it.

&gt;Sakuta clearly designed to appeal to the sort of teenage boy who sees himself as aloof and ""above it all"" (a character archetype that tends to be just as clunky as the generic beta MC)

If you really believe Sakuta is such a poorly written character, you need to provide some reasoning to why you believe so. You are free to give your opinion, but people are not obliged to listen unless you make a compelling argument.

Perhaps something you could say is that Sakuta's character may be poorly written because he his backstory doesn't really match his personality. He was described as having a ""violent past"" which implies that he must have gotten passionate about things to engage in violence. And even if he wasn't fighting for someone or something, then he had a passion for fighting. So his personality of complete apathy is random and stems out of nowhere.

Another possible criticism you could lay is that Sakuta's character is selectively apathetic. When he gets bothered by someone he will easily start to belittle them, which is not something you expect out of somebody who is really apathetic."

"Same reason people slow down during an accident. Morbid curiosity. Normal well adjusted people aren't filled with this much hate, and most people have the cognitive ability to filter out real news from the wild conspiracies this sub is into. I used to feel sorry for such people, probably angry about how living standards have dropped over the years. Most of you probably have never seen those good ol days when a man could work an easy job and support an entire family and a mortgage comfortably, that was our father's jobs, or maybe even grandfathers jobs. We all see this, we all know the world has shifted, we all see how the rich have hoarded their wealth in the backs of the working man. The difference is most people have recognized the reasons for this, it's so glaringly obvious what should be done, but clearly some people have chosen to be outcasts, racists, hateful bigots, and y'all want to burn it all down for everyone. So therefore, no one feels sorry for such hateful malcontents any longer, and many of you don't realize the lifelong hardship you're creating yourselves by being deliberate outcasts, this shit is recorded everywhere nowadays. This will cost many of you dearly, lost jobs, lost friends, embarrassed families, no girlfriends, it's kinda sad but at some point, it's well deserved.

Probably wasn't the best example to show due to the range of Pumpking's normal attacks, but it works pretty well against anything else.

That being said, i do agree there are more scenarios where Lily would be able deal more damage safely. But i think you are underestimating Xander's damage to the OD bar. Due to his weapon and passive, he probably breaks bosses the fastest even if he's on the neutral element.  As another person in this thread has mentioned, it completely changes the tempo of the fight and it means bosses have less time to do their most powerful moves (e.g. Mercury's wide range Aqua Spiral). In general, I think the utility aspect of it is so much better than Lily's freeze  since not all bosses can be afflicted by her status affect.

"Shaming men for being unable to have sex is simping and putting the pussy on a pedestal. It is essentially saying that a mans worth is defined by his ability to be a dancing monkey for women.

It makes absolutely zero sense to put any weight into what women desire since they are essentially grown up children who run on emotions. "

"That's fair. Families tend to be tough, I went to a rough school so I waited until 21 because of just fear of abuse at school, then work. UK system is a little strict. It's a 13m waiting period for 1st appointment, and the only GICs I know of are in London and Manchester, so it's always a long journey, then the process is pretty simple from there. They make you come out first, and you have to get a deed poll to legally change name by your second appointment, you have to have passed two psychological evaluations, appointments 1 and 2 serve as those where they get the impression Gender Dysphoria is the real cause and that you're financially and emotionally stable so that the NHS funding isn't wasted on you, and that you actually know what you're asking for. Once you're on meds they give you other options like group therapy, speech and language and free facial hair removal (but that hasn't happened for me yet). The only bad thing about the UK is the waiting times are so long. And if a doctor cancels on you it's really awful to go up to London alone and be told your appointment's cancelled. Which happened to me once. Luckily the doctors are all friendly. An important boon to the UK is they're judgement free. I'm anaemic so the operation may be out of the question for me. Blood related issues and liver conditions make surgeries riskier especially in blood saturated areas, but they said as long as I'm safe to take Progynova they'll prescribe it to me and that surgery is only optional. I hope to get it but I can live without it if I have no choice as long as one day people see me and know I'm a woman you know? I've never been particularly sexually motivated anyway."

"I have two objections to this position. The first is your implication that character optimization only deals with the Combat pillar of the game. Tracking, investigation, infiltration and chases all have mechanical support and characters can and are built to follow incentives in those systems. Painting people who follow the mechanical incentives written into the game as *obsessed with killing* is disingenuous and unfair.

My second objection is flipping the characterization of the discussion here. This thread wasn't started by someone complaining that there are people making suboptimal characters, it was started by belac39 excoriating people for not ignoring the mechanics."

"I 100% agree with you that we need a few iconic maps in the game. But as a Kiwi, Greece sounds awesome. Specifically the Battle of Crete was one of the most important battles for my country in the war. Even if they don't go to Crete, it is cool to see Greece represented in a WW2 game. Greece was also important for Britain, Australia, Italy and obviously Greece itself. That's a lot of nations that get to see this specific part of their history in a video game for the first time.

Crete would also be awesome from a gameplay perspective. It's perfectly built for an operations mode. The battle involved the last ever major parachute operation by the Nazis. They swept over the island slowly pushing off the ANZAC, Greek and British defenders. Think about it, you have the opening map with German paratroopers, a mid round map in the hills of Crete and a third map on the cost as the Allies evacuate.

The Germans won but they took so many casualties in the initial landings that Hitler forbid anymore parachute operations for the rest of the war. It's something Kiwis can pride themselves on as our main contribution to the war effort as the defence of Crete was under New Zealand command."

"&gt;It can't be compared to other services using the total amount because none of those return cash for taxes.

They return other things. I'm not sure why you think that means they can't be compared. When you go shopping, you trade money for all sorts of different things, but we don't talk about buying bananas vs buying milk as if they are drastically different kinds of events and fundamentally incomparable. Why should we talk about paying the government for infrastructure, disaster protection, education, etc vs paying the government for UBI as if they are drastically different and fundamentally incomparable?

&gt;Yes it could be taxed other ways, but its just accounting at that point.

Is it? How do you figure?

Imagine we have a choice between (1) taxing all the cars manufactured in or imported into the country, and (2) taxing all the wheat grown in or imported into the country. And imagine for the sake of argument that we project that both of these taxes will generate exactly the same amount of government revenue. Nevertheless, it seems to me like one of these policies would result in people driving a lot fewer cars, and one of them would result in people eating a lot less bread. That hardly seems like 'just accounting'. Do you disagree that such effects would manifest?

&gt;Different tax schemes just move around incentives for what individuals purchase.

Exactly. That doesn't seem like 'just accounting' to me.

&gt;Since we currently use income taxation as our primary tool it makes sense to continue using it for at least the purposes of discussion so as to not confuse people.

Does it, though? If people object to income tax, finding another funding source could help to convince people that UBI is a good idea."

"Maybe in a general consensus. I'd argue a lot of his ""supporters"" don't like him half as much as he or his administration would like to believe. He's just a really dumb guy, and most of the country knows it. Some may choose to support him anyway because of his party or because he sometimes does things they like, but I think it's often in spite of them knowing how dumb he is.

Regardless, being right-winged does **not** require supporting Trump. I mean, why does our political climate aggressively attempt to associate people with parties? I can't say that I support either current major party more than, I don't know, 65%. This is because while my policies and values can align with certain politicians, they rarely align with said politicians' actual actions when in office. There just isn't accountability for our representatives anymore, because no one really puts forth the effort necessary to understand what each congressional decision implies, and people have a short and forgiving memory concerning scandals. I hate that my nation is currently in a position where my two choices may be some criminal, ignorant, dishonest bonehead or someone who will actively work towards policies I think will be harmful to our nation and may also be a criminal, ignorant, dishonest bonehead. Do I vote for the option I more closely align with? Or is his opponent slightly less ignorant and criminal, and do I thus have an obligation to vote for them? Do I vote for the candidate I like despite that he'll never make it, or do I support a subpar option with the hope he'll be the lesser evil?

"Matchmaking idea

I’m not sure if this has been done before but the idea just came to me. Why not have a criteria for matchmaking be something like an “overlapping play period” matchup. The system would match you up to players who play at similar hours and time frames as you do. This could help players meet people who’d they be able to play with on a more consistent basis, deepening the sense of community they get out of the game"

"I don't know what an X-ray can actually detect and not, but according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chest-x-rays/about/pac-20393494) there is a lot of stuff that can be seen on a chest X-ray.  I am not a medical doctor, so I won't comment on that any further.
However, I went through a long process with my employer about what was required and what was not required.  I don't have all the old emails anymore, but the x-ray was one of the required elements.  If you [see here](https://www.jniosh.go.jp/icpro/jicosh-old/english/osh/outline/9.html), for instance, they list the following as required:
&gt; Medical and work history of each worker; presence or absence of subjective and objective symptoms; height, weight, eyesight and audibility; thoracic X-ray examination and sputum examination; blood pressure; anemia; hepatic function; lipid level in blood; blood sugar examination; urine analysis; and examination by electrocardiogram.

My argument with my employer was that I didn't want the stomach x-ray and I wanted to use my own doctor.  It took a bit of pressure to get them to read the laws, but they agreed to both in the end.

It also says that people only need to be examined for TB if they are diagnosed as being vulnerable to the disease."

"It’s hard to make anyone view things from your perspective, even if you take the time to view things from their perspective, most people will judge things at face value and dismiss it.

This is why movies are amazing to me, 

they convey one’s perspective to another, brilliantly.

This movie has made people feel.

In any movie review of James Cameron’s AVATAR, we are mostly told it is praised for it’s CGI and not for it’s story. Which for the most part, lacked originality. Comparisons are made to previous stories. 

Stories such as Ferngully, Pocahontas, and Dances with Wolves. 

In fact, it was common for people to simply say, 

“AVATAR is (insert movie) in space”. 

What astounds me is that while people compare AVATAR to these films, 

they do not compare it to the events and situations that these films are focused on. 

Events and situations that are still ongoing to this day.

AVATAR uses symbolism and imagery to portray the atrocities committed by the Corporatocracy. 

And, how our ignorance not only allows these atrocities to occur — but, also has halted our evolution

AVATAR is not only a social commentary on the Extortion of Natural Resources, 

Exploitation of Indigenous Peoples, or Aboriginal Genocide. 

It is a simulation of what life can be.

It does what no film has EVER done before,showcase our connection to the Earth. 

Every claim in the analysis can be researched by anyone and a clear consensus can be reached.

"I'm speaking from a place of logic. If someone has zero respect for your neighbors border or immigration laws, it follows that they will not respect your own. 

When we accept citizens into the United States, we take crimes that immigrants have committed in other countries into account.

If they had ever had plans on legally immigrating to America they would have taken this into account.

They have no path to legal citizenship, and have demonstrated that when stopped at a border they will attempt to illegally enter. You are speaking from a place of ignorance."

"I had a tough time freebasing it as well and only received threshold effects from 40mg, a solid ""common"" dose when vaped. I decided to freebase and try to smoke the rest of what I had slowly, since I was convinced I was fucking it up anyways, so I vaped a little less than 135mg freebase. First little hit and I was off, not at all the ""1 minute to come up"" I'd read about. 

Time stopped. My reality broke apart. I was convinced I'd gone too far and broken my brain. Panic set in, my whole body was shaking, and I forgot how to handle a hard trip. I'm not sure if I blacked out for a part of it, but I have vague memories of meeting God and seeing the inner workings of all things. It was so alien and uncomfortable and just strange. Really was disassociating, and I could still see the world around me with eyes open, unlike with DMT. I had over an hour of strong psychedelia to follow.

"The other one key problem with the area is the presence of too many cross junctions on the main arterial thoroughfares - there shouldn't be any as it slows down traffic a lot leading to unnecessary build ups and congestion in the morning as people from down south make their way down town to work. The road from Taman Tunku all the way up to Lutong should be nonstop and is doable as there are still ample land around the 6/4-lane traffic light monstrosities.

Also, the general hospital is ripe for an upgrade - the medical and support staff are doing what they can but the age of the infrastructure is showing. Needs a bigger, more modern complex as the number of people seeking treatment who can't afford private health care are increasing, especially from the outskirts of town. It's very warm in the afternoons and doesn't cool down much until midnight. 

Aside from that you're correct about the ambience - it's quieter than a busy and noisy big town, people don't rush around that much and are generally more chill."

"Only if it's harm done to the left, or anything that, if real, would be damaging to the rightwing agenda (such as gun violence). If it's the left committing violence, then you're not going to see any false flag submissions. 

Remember when there was a shooting at YouTube and the immediate response here was that the media was going to report that it was a rightwing white male, but that it was all a lie and a false flag that would be used to justify further oppression and silencing of rightwing white men? Then it turned out to be a seemingly leftwing woman of Iranian decent, and suddenly it was no longer a false flag? 

I don't recall seeing ""false flag"" submissions following the ""ricin"" scare. And that one *actually* turned out to be untrue (it wasn't ricin, but castor seeds). Did OP submit anything saying that was suspicious timing? Nothing about it being odd that the ""ricin"" angle was pushed so hard, despite the substance being castor seeds? No suspicion here that someone on the right sent a *safe* substance to multiple rightwing targets, and then pushed the story that it was poison?

"What do you mean why are there no v-twin super bikes? You mean like Ducati's entire Panigale line up pre 2018? The 1299 Panigale being an absolute monster of a bike putting out 205 hp and just over 100 lb ft of torque?  


As to why there are no v-twin superbikes any longer, this may answer your question:  


&gt;Having reached the limits of performance with its twin-cylinder engines,  enlarging and improving them over time until they were producing a  completely bonkers 200bhp or more, the Italian exponents of two-wheeled  speed are moving to V4s derived directly from their MotoGP programme. 

&amp;#x200B;

They pour millions of dollars into the development of these, so it makes sense to trickle some of that development to consumers vs. developing two types of engines. Also horsepower always trumps torque, and having this much torque on a bike is not really superior, it's mostly just unmanageable. I have a friend with a Triumph Rocket - a 2.2 liter inline triple. It makes around 144 lb ft of torque and it does a burn out in 3rd gear while moving. Not really all that useful.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Is it a joke or is it diplomacy? You've gotta pick one dude. Your double standards are glaring obvious. I notice you also completely ignored the part where he called the extra judicial massacre a ""riot"". 

Speaking of double standards, you bash CK for offending some veterans, but completely ignore the at least 3 seperate occasions in which Trump explicitly offended veterans? At least CK was trying to accomplish something and did nothing but kneel. If you're going to bash CK because a minority of veterans thought what CK did was distateful, you have to apply the same to Trump whose multiple offensive actions were entirely unjustified. Again, double standards.

I applaud you for still being here though."

"Oh, I don't mean 'asava' when I said terms relating more to the sravaka tradition. In fact, I have already changed it to 'asrava' in my OP even before this comment of yours came.

I said it more as a general principle I would probably adopt in my translation. Like for instance, Huangbo mentioned once or twice about the supposed attainments of the four fruits. So I'm thinking of using the terms sotapanna, sakadagami, anagami and arahant in my notes when talking about these four fruits.

Interestingly, Huangbo also quoted one of the dharma seals - 諸行無常 (zhu xing wu chang) - which means 'all conditioned phenomena are not constant'. I am considering translating it as 'all sankharas annica' which might be more familiar to some readers."

"LMs can't even VOTE ON TRADES, process trades right now or edit rosters, making processing trades impossible. We have to wait 1 day for trades to be processed now when they could have been done instantly before, it also pressures the league members to vote in 1 day, whereas before they had more time. I also have to bug people about voting faster and tell them not to vote on ESPN anymore in case a trade gets vetoed, in which case I have to re-enable the voting function and set ""Votes to veto"" to 1, then back to ""LM Only Vetos"" so that a league member doesn't accidentally make a mistake. The max number of votes to veto is 4 as well, and since I want that set at 5, all trade voting has to be done off-site now. Not to mention having to set up an anonymous survey off-site with specific links for each team so that they can't vote more than once, for EVERY trade. Horrible."

"I can see where you’re coming from. When I was thirteen and just going into high school, my method was similar. I won’t lie, though—it wasn’t good for me at all. 

That year I was struggling with my already-present anxiety and I started struggling with depression. Being around toxic people made it a lot worse, which ironically made me isolate myself even more. But they were my only “friends” at the time, and I was too scared to talk to people I didn’t already know to realize that they weren’t actually my friends.

Now, I just turned seventeen a few weeks ago and am a senior. It’s been several years to get to this place, but I can tell you what a difference it makes. This year has been an incredibly good year for me, academically and socially. And I know for a fact that a big reason why is because I decided to value myself and choose to be around the people that made me feel wanted. 

I know it’s a lot harder in practice to do this, especially if you are shy and introverted, but the pay-off is huge. Try branching out a bit more if you can find ways to do so."

It is not so good with the stationary games like sims, some ghosting goes a long way in a sim.

"you are arguing for the RP end of the stormwind fallacy.  

I can make my synergized decisions and not be a munchkin who cares naught for RP.  I can also make a character that is focused on some RP aspect that doesn't purposely make bad decisions that lack synergy.  the 2 are not mutually exclusive.

further, most people view their characters to be heroes of the story.  as such, they believe their adventure naturally *should* be the best they can be at what they want to accomplish.  people generally don't want to play someone who is deliberately disabled or otherwise mediocre at their chosen task, they want to play someone who is heroic, great, and special compared to a commoner, because an adventurer is distinctly not a commoner by nature of not being just a normal city guard or farmer or chef or noble or crafter or [insert background here].  it's built into the game that you had a background, but have now chosen to be something more than your background, and therefore it's already implied that your character is special.  the next logical step is to make that special character distinctly better than those around him at what he's attempting to complete.  human nature will be human nature.

finally, stop trying to tribalize the community around the ""right"" way to make a character.  people will play what they want to play, accept that and move on either to a different game or your next 5e campaign.  I never tell someone who wants a deliberately unsynergized ""RP"" character that their fun is wrong, stop telling me that me making synergized choices is wrong fun."

"Sorry for this long and probably confusing comment.

If want to get better at jump canceling with Vergil start with Beowulf, since some of the animations you can only get out of by jump canceling. And it's the easiest one to start with, Force edge is the second easiest, and Yamato being the hardest with how fast it hits. 

With Lunar phase and Rising sun you are stuck in those animations unless you jump cancel out of them or if you get hit by an enemy. It's kinda trickey at first, but it does get easier the more you do it. There is teleport canceling, but it's not that useful with Beowulf and it's a lot harder to get the timing down.

You probably know about this already, but just in case you don't. Unlike Dante, Vergil can use his summon swords while attacking at same time. He can also do this while dodging and teleporting. Depending on your button lay out, this can be easy or this can be hard. If it's the default controls for the melee and shoot buttons are right next to each other it's not going to be that hard.

Personally I use bloody palace for getting better, getting familiar the character's play styles, and seeing what works and doesn't against enemies. Since unlike DMC4 there is no timer, so it feels more like a training mode of sorts where the AI is not a punching bag. Just keep practicing, and weapon switch more often. I hope this kinda helps. I can maybe give you a strategy for Beowulf as Vergil if you like. 

I could also talk about how to use teleports in more ways of attacking, than just to dodge. Because you have Darkslayer lvl 3, and that's when this style becomes really fun. But I don't want this comment to get longer than it already has, it's already longer than I thought it was going to be.     "

Lime has data on everything so if they don't punish hoarders essentially they'll show they support it.

For the two situations you suggest - The one about standing near or over some scooters right before they are harvest-able should be fine. I mean, if doing so prevents someone from paying to ride one then Lime would probably rather you didn't.

Physically collecting them 15 mins before is probably bad on a number of points. First, there's no guarantee all three scooters (in your example) will be ready to harvest so you may have to unload it once you see it's not. You can't continue to hang on to it hoping it will become available because that is hoarding and Lime would be able to see it moving around the city without being ridden and could get you flagged. Generally speaking, starting 15 minutes early is not a big deal in my mind. Honestly the best strategy is to watch for patterns and look at the rider map before heading out in order to estimate where multiple scooters will become available. It will save you lots of wasted work trying to guess which ones will be harvest-able or driving around with ones that don't need to be charged at that particular time."

Get the insulation strips, some heat tape and clean it up with heat and elbow grease. I've gummed mine up with globs of PLA that pretty much covered the block at least twice, its very salvageable (unless it just doesn't heat up anymore at all - Which could be any number of other problems and not just the heat block/throat/element/etc. you have in your hand here)."

I personally really like the Butterfox one since it's relatively small, can carry a bunch of games and accessories (including a second pair of JoyCons or a charger), doubles as a stand, and has a nice and simple design.

3) If you find the JoyCons too uncomfortable to use, the Pro Controller will solve that problem for you. It is pretty expensive, though, so I'd only get it if you really can't stand them.

4) You'll probably need a microSD card at some point, but it's hard to know how big of one you'll need.

Lack of full awareness of what's happening in the arena results in getting cauterized or exa-flared. Ice markers get mis-placed a lot. The timing generally just feels a lot tighter in O10S.

"I have bipolar with borderline personality traits. I have no self esteem whatsoever. None, ZERO. I think I'm extremely ugly and fat (but according to everyone apparently I'm not, that I'm pretty and of average weight). I know I can easily change that by working out and get to the shape I desire. But I don't even have the will to live so I don't have the motivation to do anything in life. I don't really know what to do with myself and what I want to do in the future, IF I even live to see it.

And with all this in my mind I feel terrible that my boyfriend who I love very much has to see me enduring all this when he finds me extremely beautiful and loves me for who I am."
"Back in 2010 I went to my schools health services because of some intense pelvic pain. My doctor couldn’t tell me much except that my uterus looked a little inflamed. I did a full screen of STD testing and everything came back negative. She gave me a pamphlet about PID and sent me on my way with antibiotics. The pamphlet didnt have information about PID that wasn’t a cause of STDs. I was so confused and lived in secret shame for years, thinking I had some kind of Undetected STI. 

I read articles online and started to fear that my Fallopian tubes must be scarred up and twisted, I thought my uterus must look nasty and riddled with adhesions. For years I was too scared to go see an OBGYN. I finally broke down in 2016, got an annual exam, and mentioned my history to a new OBGYN. She made a judgmental face and immediately asked what kind of STD I had. I said I didn’t have one, and that I was thoroughly tested at the time I got checked out. She raised her eyebrows and said “if you’ve got PID Then you definitely have an STD.” I was horrified and so upset that she wasn’t believing me.  Not too long after, I started school for ultrasound. We studied OBGYN pathophysiology, and I was surprised to read that PID can also be caused by bacterial infections and other extra-uterine causes like appendicitis - 30% of cases, actually! I got my uterus scanned by students and professionals during training and my uterus was perfectly fine, 

Fallopian tubes undetectable (as they should be!) 
I feel like there is a lot of misinformation about PID out there, and there’s definitely a social stigma involved. I just wanted to share my story! I hope those who are diagnosed with PID or STDs are being treated with respect and compassion. You never know a patient’s whole story! "

"Yeah, it is. A computer for me was a necessity, and something decent enough to run Fortnite (albeit at lower settings) was really just a *lucky gift.* So I take advantage and use it during my free time.

Living paycheck to paycheck, or being required to save out of concern that something might happen, is what makes dishing out $10 generally unaffordable, at least on most occasions. My car might break down, I might need unexpected gas money, my little brother might need lunch money or a new graphing calculator (TIs are crazy expensive and they tend to get stolen in my area), etc.

I personally have run into the problem of literally not having enough gas money to make it home from work (and I work late at night and far-ish from home, so I can't often get rides from friends or family) enough that I just gave up on spending extra money on things I enjoy, even alcohol, weed, and cigarettes which used to get me through the day, lol.

I realize it's not really your fault, and it's probably not intentional, but sometimes comments along the lines of ""how can you not afford $10 for something you enjoy?"" can be pretty decent blows to somebody's ego or insecurities. I generally recommend that people avoid making these types of comments on the internet, especially Reddit, where there is such a broad audience.

My car is Belgium now at the moment and I need to get a Dutch number plate as well. What I know is that I need to go to the RDW and they will take my Belgium number plate and destroy it. You have to arrange a couple of days before a temporary number plate that's only valid for one day so you can drive from the RDW to home. The temporary numberplate you can get online at the website of the RDW. They will send one to your address but it might take like 2 days. Then what I know from the RDW is that they will send me a new number plate but that takes like a week. So that means you can't drive your car for a week. I don't know how it works from Germany to the Netherlands but I'm pretty sure it's the same. I don't even think you have to go to the garage for that. It took me a few calls before they could tell me the right information tho haha. And Belgium also told me something different so I get your frustration.

People are waiting for homing torpedos to come out.  It should still be a few months before we get the event that'll make them available.  Up to you.  If you've already gotten the best CA AP gun from ironbloods, it's probably best to hold on to them.

&gt;Third of all, is San Diego a good ship overall? I’ve been using her and I see no fault, but is she a keeper?

She's really bad at the current moment.  There are a whole bunch of ships that are both stronger and cheaper to use than her. She does get a retrofit later on that makes her god tier, but it was just released on the other servers.  We might be waiting a while before we can make her extremely good."

also looks like the ladder is pretty much gonna reset as soon as they know if the new servers are stable (im hoping any day now) so probably worth just waiting till next ladder unless you dont mind it as a testrun for the new ladder to come

It was a pastor leading a new member of his church (who'd been a believer for several years) and he asked him how he feels about leading small groups or discipling younger believers. His response was, ""I'm a little uncomfortable, I feel like this should be a responsibility of pastors and people with official titles in the church"".

I think a million in debt is an outlier. Certainly debt has gone up, but let's not overstate it.

&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion, higher education, as a function of knowledge transfer can under the right conditions be more effective as an individual pursuit. That isn't why people go to college. 

I agree, pure knowledge transfer is not the point of college. 

&gt;They go to college to network and find a spouse. 

Well, and fitness testing. Employers have learned to value college degrees. [That's not showing much of a sign of changing; in fact, employers may be overvaluing college degrees](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/12/employers-are-looking-for-job-candidates-in-the-wrong-places/549080/). In such an environment, not going to college to save on student loans is probably a bad choice. 

&gt;People are losing sight of that and people are also losing/have lost sight of the fundamental value proposition: college degree equals vastly better life. As the costs rise and wages decrease due to supply, the value proposition becomes diluted and increasingly dubious. 

Yeah, no, not really. 

[In fact, not only will college graduates make more money, but not going to college could cost you dearly to the tune of $1 million in lifetime wages. ](https://www.thebalance.com/why-a-college-degree-is-still-worth-it-1289838)

A million dollars in lifetime wages! Wow. Makes that $40k in loans seem pretty cheap, doesn't it? It's also likely to be the kind of job you do at a desk or on a laptop, and not the kind of job that involves carrying heavy stuff and bending over and crawling under stuff and so on, which is something the proponents of trade schools tend to leave out. Working for a living is hard. 

&gt;Obviously, there are exceptions. However, we need to consider the cost of educating someone to a very nebulous standard and the impact that education has on the individual's ability to contribute to society both generally and in a capitalistic reward system.

I'm not sure I'm the one who's not considering that, here, champ.

"Another mystery review! This time from u/kelthfire. I always enjoy these so let's jump right in:

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 80 proof (40% ABV)

**Color**: A pale gold 

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and fruity with pear and vanilla

**Taste**: Rich and sweet. The notes are very similar to the nose with more pear and vanilla and the addition of some sherry. A little thin on the mouth feel.

**Finish**: Short and sweet with mostly sherry

### On a rock
**Nose**: Still sweet and fruity though muted with the ice.

**Taste**:  The ice opens this up a bit and helps with the mouth feel. Pears and green apples come to the forefront with the ice

**Finish**: The ice pretty thoroughly quenches the finish.

## Conclusion
### Pre-reveal
Overall this tasted like a middling Speyside scotch, alternatively a scotch style Japanese whiskey. Definitely on lower end of the proof spectrum I'd guess 80-86 proof. I wouldn't be surprised if this was a Glen-something or other aged 12ish years.

**6** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar

### Post-reveal
Ayyy I was pretty close. Monkey's Shoulder batch 27 is a blend of 3 Speyside Single malts, **Glen**fiddich, Balvenie and Kininvie, 80 proof and no age statement but what can you do? The rating lines up with how I use Monkey Shoulder at home, as a cocktail scotch for variations on a whiskey sour.

You can also read [this](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/10/24/Review-33-Monkey-Shoulder-Batch-27-as-a-Mystery-Sample/) and my other reviews at [atxbourbon.com](http://atxbourbon.com).

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks "

I'm in full support of justice for people that abuse anybody ,let alone kids. I'm not going to continue this though as I know it ends with harsh assumptions of my life experience and beliefs because I guess that's just what our world has turned into.

Appreciate your subtle jabs over any personal attacks for real though"

"I've been playing something similar. The deck isn't sleek but I do think it works. There's a lot of be said for just playing a lot of powerful cards, and then having the synergy be 'cards that are good'. The manabase is really good, your offensive draws are sometimes incredibly powerful (Knight -&gt; History -&gt; Aurelia represents so much damage), and you just play a lot of hard to deal with high value threats, while keeping just enough controlling elements to be valuable.

"I mean first you’ve been told the actual facts : 3% of terrorism in the U.S. is left wings.

Now, for your feelings, I know some people of Antifa have caused some damage to private property but remember :

1.	Antifa is not an actual organization, it’s a name under which some protesters assemble
2.	Antifa’s goal is literally anti-fascism, which is good. The KKK’s goals are bad from the start
3.	Protesting is free speech, and your civic duty
4.	Even though damaging property is bad optics, and that I don’t condone it, it’s material stuff. They’re not killing people, unlike rightwing terrorists.
5.	The Proud Boys had caches of weapons around one of their protests, and had a sniper on a roof.
6.	Wearing masks is sadly often needed now, given the personal retaliation one can get from protesting, from being fired to being stalked, doxxed or assaulted. 

&gt;	I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice [...]

"If everything is OK, why make extra effort to end it? Why not a 30 year deadline rather than 30 days - you’ll fit a lot more in!

I beg to differ, in that I’d say you’re suicidal - you’re wanting to end your life. You say you’re not depressed or unhappy etc, but want to experience the ending of your existence. Why so, if none of these more ‘obvious’ factors apply?

Have you read any further philosophy texts on suicide? David Humes ‘On Suicide’ is short and succinct (nutshell: man doesn’t throw things away that they believe can be kept). Durkheim’s types of suicide are interesting, think you’d really enjoy reading up on those."

"If Canada Post Corporation locked the workers out would you blame them, or would you still blame CUPW? One of the reasons customers blame us is because we are the face of Canada Post that you see on the street. Not management inside a plant or inside a corporate office. You just see us. And if there is something about CP that bothers you, we end up being the face of blame. Decisions to our collective agreement are being determined by people we, or you, don't see and it affects the quality of our livelihood and the trust of the customer. We know you need meds, weed, your niece's birthday gift, your bills. But our company who relies on the carriers and plant employees to get those things out to you is not doing us or YOU any favours by being stubborn at the bargaining table. We want a wage increase that is in line with the cost of living increase, and they won't budge. I shouldn't have to justify my reasons for wanting a collective agreement that benefits me, just as you shouldn't have to justify your needs from your employer, but there is one of them. I get that the situation is frustrating, I really do, and maybe you have had bad luck with your carrier from CP, but to boycott us and throw us under the bus because we are only standing up to our employer for a better collective agreement doesn't seem fair. But hey, that's my two cents. I hope the labour dispute ends and we as CUPW employees can win your trust back."

There’s clearly a reason why they didn’t make separate modes.  Epic probably wants to force people to experience fortnitemares.  Idk why they would but they definitely didn’t just add it to screw over others that don’t like the zombies.

"I know you probably won't reply anymore but I had already did this so

did some math to show how much aggressor and ignis help out with damage output

Brave sword max mt: 14
Celica's gale max mt: 9

Physical attack during player turn (51+14(mt)+10(aggressor))=75

Magical attack during player turn (51 +9(mt) +10(aggressor)) = 70

Statistically with a 50% activation rate ignis should activate 2 out of 4 times

In order to ORKO an opponent damage should be atleast 80 hit points 

Set damage calculation to 80

Physical:
2(75 - enemy defense) + 2( 100 (ignis+physical attack) - enemy defense) = 80
150+200-4(enemy defense) = 80
-4(enemy defense) = -270
Enemy defense = 67.5 

Magical: 
2(70 - enemy resistance) + 2(95 (ignis+magical attack) - enemy resistance)= 80
140+190-4(enemy resistance)= 80
-4(enemy resistance) = -250
Enemy resistance = 62.5

So this unit should ORKO enemy units with either under or equal to 67 defense or 62 resistance giving me consistent life taker activation"

"It depends how it turns out, but I think it's always better to have shops displaying the actual price you pay, in your own currency. The USD was a form of lazy tax, to trick people into paying more than they thought. Even when you're aware it's USD, it does have an effect on people. Many people got normalised in the steam ecosystem and buying games when the USD was much closer to the AUD. Unless you're particularly anal, most people aren't converting the price before each purchase. 

In AUD, steam will have more of a reason to be inline with prices from other sources, the USD gives them a bit of a buffer to be sneaky."

Let me tell you, my wife was scared when I told her I won a year supply of potatoes... she imagined a truck showing up at our tiny apartment with a pallet of potatoes!

Plus, we’d had a previous bad experience with potato delivery when a media kit for an “ultimate couch potato” contest was mailed with a real potato, delivered while we were on a 2 week vacation. Was a rotten, moldy potato by the time we returned and collected our packages."

"Anything by David Lynch. He's probably the smartest director in general. His works are all heavy on Psychology and Surrealism. He has been highly influential and once you've seen his work you start to see his influence in pretty much every other director out there.

**Eraserhead** is an old Classic. Not exactly scary but very disturbing. If you're a parent or considering it this'll really fuck you up. 

**Mulholland Drive** is polarizing but it's widely considered on of the very best movies of the 2000's by critics. It's probably the smartest move I've seen in my life, and you can spend hours and hours analyzing it after you're done and still feel like you can dig more. It has some of the scariest scenes of any movie if you're paying attention.

I didn't like **Blue Velvet** as much as those other two but it has similar widespread praise and makes a good Halloween Movie, one of the landmark works of the 1980's. It's closer to conventional Horror than the other two. 

Also if you ever get the chance, check out **Twin Peaks**. It's the only show I've seen with better writing than the Sopranos. It was made when daytime soaps were a big deal (early 90's) and much of the first 2 seasons is parodying them in a subtle way (with very dark undertones). There was a movie after that which is unsettling to put it mildly. Then the show came back for a third season last year which was absolutely bonkers. [Here's a random scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZoUx6sMWp0) from the third season with minor characters (all 3 of them are hardly in the show) so you understand what I mean. This isn't even a particularly dark or memorable scene from the show; it's just a good example of the style without spoiling anything. It's also hysterically funny and sincere. Much of the show is incredibly life affirming and uplifting, while the entire thing has this horrific undercurrent. I'd say more about the show but it would all be hyperbole about how much better it is than every other show ever made. Which is also what I said about Mulholland Drive but David Lynch has the following and reputation he does for good reason. "

"The 3 elite RB strat was not the move this week, Marlon Mack and Cohen were chalky value this week. I think DK is pricing down a lot of the mid tier backs to discourage this strategy. 

Game stacks depend on the size of the slate. In the main it’s pretty risky to take more than 3 players from anyone team, I like QB/WR or TE stacks but I think stacking a QB with an RB isn’t very good unless the QB is mobile. I don’t like to take more than 4 players from anyone game. "

"&gt; Can they pull it back and be the stepping stone required for radical change to occur?

Honestly, it has long since been time for them to shit or get off the pot... if they go with Warren in 2020, [mistakenly thinking that she represents true reform](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/23/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-democratic-party-2020-differences)... then they're fucked imo. 

&gt;Or are they too far gone and only revolution will bring on any real change?

The Democratic Party has never been an agent for advancing radical change... they just step in afterwords and claim they were for it all along. In this sense, they were never really ""there before"" and ""gone now."" As far as attempts at reform go however, they must be made regardless of how possible it is to reform or rehabilitate late capitalism. Only when repeated attempts to peacefully achieve reform have failed will a sizable majority of ""non-radical"" people come around to the idea that it's not a viable path and even consider entertaining more revolutionary ideas.

-The cadaver dogs lead to a potential dumping/burial ground that is conveniently Manitowoc County property.

"Tycho Brahe is an amazing historical figure. He was a Danish court astronomer, friends with Johannes Kepler, and he coined the name ""supernova"" after observing the flash of a star dying-- he thought it was the birth of a star rather than death, hence 'nova' for new.

He lost the bridge of his nose in a duel with a mathematician and wore a prosthetic metal nose. He and the mathematician were apparently having an argument about possible answers to an equation which at that period in time had no solution (the concepts necessary to solve it weren't invented yet so there was no way to prove whose ideas were right)-- since they had no way of settling the 'correct' solution by mathematics, they decided to settle the answer to the equation by having a duel instead.

As a result Brahe ended up having to wear a prosthetic nose-- his normal one was made of brass but it's said he had gold and silver noses to switch to for special occasions.

He apparently kept a pet elk. Some of the correspondence we have has one of his mentors ask whether he knows out of curiosity if deer can run fast, to which Tycho replies he doesn't know but could send him his elk to test it instead. When the mentor agrees ans offers to trade a horse for it, however, Tycho reports back that the elk got drunk and accidentally fell down some stairs. Quote: ""unluckily the elk one day walked up the stairs into a room, where it drank so much strong beer, that it lost its footing when going down the stairs again"".

Most notorious however was the story surrounding his death, which it seems Kepler embellished a little. According to Kepler, Brahe was at a banquet where the royal family were in attendance, but unfortunately he was really bursting for a piss. Since it was against good etiquette to stand up in the presence of royalty, that meant that he had to hold it in. The story as Kepler told it was that he apparently held it in to such a degree that his bladder exploded-- though it seems more likely that he just had a bladder rupture. He suffered over several days, living long enough to write his own epitaph: ""He lived as a sage and died as a fool."""

"I’ve been wanting him gone since 2015. This just furthers it. And I’m glad people are finally seeing it. He’s not a good coach. His inability is being masked by Ben and Jo’s talent, but every now and then, like last night, you get a glimpse of it. 

He’s great for a piss poor tanking team, and that’s what he was supposed to be; Part of the process. A bad coach of a bad team until assets could be acquired. Had Hinkie remained, he would have replaced Brett by now. I guarantee you Hinkie’s plan was not to hire the worst scrubs he could to tank on purpose and put the best coach he could find at the helm. No. Just like all the process players, so too must go the process coach if we want to contend. 

He has held on for as long as he has due to us having 3 different GMs in a short period of time, the last of which is close with him. And yeah, it’s great that he gets to see the team turn it around after those awful years, and I’m glad you are happy for him, but just because he’s a nice guy doesn’t mean he’s taking us any further than playoffs round two. Everyone has a point where their skill set can’t get any better and he is there now, so if you want to contend you better hope we get Durant or someone of comparable excellence so that the talent overpowers the coach in any situation, because Ben and Jo with a bad coach aren’t enough.

"Yeah we have this problem with communication. We have nobody else to talk to about being open other than each other, and then on top of that my fiancee is the only point of contact with our 3rd at the moment while we kinda figure out boundaries....

Whoops.



Anyway I identify with your husband. Think about it this way - he's fucking excited. Its happening. Finding someone willing to date/fuck you while you are already in a relationship as a man is 10x harder than a woman. Case in point: we were both on Tinder for 2 days before someone contacted my fiancee to warn her that I'm cheating on her. Aint' nobody said shit to me. They were all just trying to hook up with her. I've had to start using bumble instead so I don't get ""caught"".

He really just wants to talk about it to anyone that would understand and well, thats you!"

"Every animal has to keep the right amount of water in its blood compared to all the stuff dissolved in that water, or else osmosis will start to either burst or deflate the cells of its body, leading to seizures and an agonising death. When there's too little water in the system you drink more to replenish it.

But sea water is very salty, which adds too much to the ""stuff dissolved in the water"" column. If you were dehydrated before, it only makes the problem worse. Any animal that lacks the instinct to seek out fresh water and avoid saltwater will have some swift Darwinian selection happen to it.

* But wait, what about ocean fish, they live in the sea and drink that salty water all the time...

Saltwater fish have kidneys that are adapted to continually pump that excess salt back out into their urine. Other ocean creatures just keep their insides at the same overall level of concentration as sea water so there's no discrepancy. Meanwhile freshwater fish have the opposite problem - they're constantly taking on more water with *nothing* dissolved in it, and need to get rid of the excess. So they lost the mechanisms for purging salt, because they weren't necessary.

We (and most other familiar animals) descend from freshwater fish that lived in rivers before making the jump onto land. That's why we're so wasteful with water that it leaks out of every pore and gets used in profligate quantities to dilute our waste. We're still running on an age-old architecture that had no need to conserve water because it was immersed in the stuff all day.

For an example of the opposite, insects descend from saltwater fish. Their ancestors made the leap directly from ocean to beach without a freshwater phase; which is part of why insects remain so efficient in their use of water that they rarely need to drink - they still have the water-conserving mechanisms of an animal that's doesn't want to have to purge the salt out of yet more brine."

So I fly them and upgrade them whenever I can.  The ship I fly most that I don't love quite as much is the T9.  I use it mostly for Powerplay fortifying and to earn a bit of coin on the return legs.  I spend a bit of time in the Krait, and T6 as well.  My most expensive ship is my T10 which was purchased originally as a jumpier and more survivable T9, but after the T9 cargo nerf, I returned to the T9 and now hardly fly the T10.

If I was really trying to max-engineer any of my ships, I might feel a little more compelled to focus on one or two but as it is, I do at least mild engineering on all of them (FSD, thrusters, etc.)."

First of all, holy crap that thing gets a lot of power, decent bit more than the 720s preorder maxxed out haha. Also, let me know whether or not you're running the forza aftermarket front/rear aero, that can change some of these settings a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tires**

2 bar front, 1.9 bar rear

&amp;#x200B;

**Camber**

\-1.7 degrees front, -1.1 degrees rear.

A lot of things can change that though, from how stiff you make the ARBs or even spring stiffness/ride height because as the suspension compresses it also creates negative camber at the wheels. It's a good starting point for anything 911 I tune here in FH4.

&amp;#x200B;

**Toe**

Leave both at 0 and see how it works

&amp;#x200B;

**Caster**

3.8 degrees

&amp;#x200B;

**ARBs**

20.0 front, 32.8 rear

&amp;#x200B;

**Springs**

Metric - 88.7kg/mm front, 130kg/mm rear

English - 496lbs front, 727.5lbs rear

&amp;#x200B;

**Ride height**

Metric - 9.9cm front, 11.9cm rear

English - 3.9in front, 4.7in rear

&amp;#x200B;

**Rebound**

6.8 front, 9.8 rear

&amp;#x200B;

**Bump**

3.4 front, 4.9 rear

I try to keep my bump stiffness at 50% of my rebound to start out, then make adjustments after I drive around a bit. One of the most annoying things to fiddle with in Forza imo because even slight adjustments can change the car's behavior quite a bit lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**Brakes**

42% balance, 200% pressure.

More of a personal preference than anything, especially if someone uses ABS. If you don't use ABS and 200% pressure isn't something you're used to, turn it down a little until you feel comfortable with it and don't lock the brakes frequently.

&amp;#x200B;

**Differential**

Front: 46% acceleration, 0% deceleration

Rear: 94% acceleration, 78% deceleration

Torque split: 78% to the rear

&amp;#x200B;

That's generally where I'd start on my tune, and then I'd drive it around for a while making the more fine adjustments as I went along. Seeing as I don't have the car though I can't do that, so just a fair warning that this may or may not work well lol. Also be warned that some cars just feel weird in the game no matter what you do to them, not that I expect the preorder 911 to handle badly(the preorder McLaren is awesome btw) but it could still have some odd quirks.

&amp;#x200B;

If there's any major issues with the way the car drives I'd be more than happy to help walk you through the steps of trying to correct it.

&amp;#x200B;

"I know little about the modern art world, but this reminds me of one of my favorite artists, [Yves Klein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Klein). For those unfamiliar with his work, he has a shade of blue named after him, because after a while he started painting exclusively in that shade of blue. Later, he pulled off a brilliant stunt of performance art:

&gt; For his next exhibition at the Iris Clert Gallery (April 1958), Klein chose to show nothing whatsoever, called La spécialisation de la sensibilité à l’état matière première en sensibilité picturale stabilisée, Le Vide (The Specialization of Sensibility in the Raw Material State into Stabilized Pictorial Sensibility, The Void): he removed everything in the gallery space except a large cabinet, painted every surface white, and then staged an elaborate entrance procedure for the opening night; The gallery's window was painted blue, and a blue curtain was hung in the entrance lobby, accompanied by republican guards and blue cocktails. Thanks to an enormous publicity drive, 3,000 people queued up, waiting to be let into an empty room.

I find that absolutely brilliant.

I don’t know how well Picasso pattern-matches that whole “half the time just seeing how much he can get away with” but it’s clear that his style was a deliberate choice, and he had plenty of artistic talent. Really, any time someone manages to catch people’s attention that effectively, that in itself is notable. If it was a sort of gaming attention, more power to him for doing something new enoughand different enough that it worked.  

EDIT: To be clear, I don’t disagree on the aesthetic appeal of his work, nor on a personal preference for aesthetically appealing work. But many artists who create beautiful paintings have been forgotten, and Picasso has not. That, combined with his talent, suggests to me that his fame was very deliberate and probably as deserved as any fame of that sort is."

"Here is my standard answer:

Are you ambidextrous?  If not, then consciously use your  ‘wrong hand’ for a week, a month, a year or better yet the rest of your life.

You will not do well to start but get the hang of it after a while.  But you can not do it without being mentally uncomfortable with it.  You can learn to do it and maybe become good at it but you will always ‘know’ it is wrong for you.  The correct hand just feels right!  Eventually you just get annoyed and switch to the correct hand.

Now what if your family is all right handed and they all insisted from infancy you were right handed too.  You knew it felt wrong but they are older and wiser so you accepted their label and help in being right handed.  As you got older they dismissed your pleading of being a lefty because they didn’t want to deal with that and said it was just a phase.  

You meet some lefties in school and get to know, like and want to be lefty with them.  Some may have even encouraged you to try.  You know you find writing easier and correct as a lefty but the family and world doesn’t agree.  Your signature is in righty and you cannot change that since you have legally established yourself as a righty!  You are stuck as a righty knowing full well you are a lefty.  

You try but finally it all comes to a head and you mentally have to switch.  Boom!  There are fights, heavy resistance and many trying to prove you are not left handed!  But there are also those supportive folks that don’t care what handed you are or help you flourish regardless of your ‘choice’ to be left or right.  You *need* to be left handed and find life much easier and comfortable once you become the correct handed ness.

For those who are transgender. Replace handedness with gender in the above example.  It is a similar feeling and battle  but on a much bigger more difficult scale.

Your brain ‘knows’ what it is and is uncomfortable in the body it was given to operate in.  Some transgender people can deal with the discomfort while most of us eventually get frustrated knowing what is right for us.  Some get frustrated to the point of suicide (41%)!

Changing the body is actually much easier and more successful than trying to reprogram the brain."

&gt;  
&gt;""Don't worry; we're super-committed to Rift,"" Mitchell continued in our interview. ""I'm personally super-committed to Rift. \[Iribe\] is, too... I know people want to see future hardware iterations. They're going to have to wait a little longer. Today is all about Quest, \[but\] *we have future plans for PC*. They're super exciting. It's where I'm spending the majority of my time \[emphasis added\].""

This was at the Connect conference, he said that he knows that people wanted to see info about future PC harware but they would have to wait for more info because that day at Connect was all about Quest

This has nothing to do with canceling rift 2, has nothing to do with Iribe leaving or the supposed rumor.  This was just saying you have to wait to find out more"

"Personally, I did notice something slightly off about the field.  I sit close to the field and mentioned something to the person sitting next to me at the beginning of the game that the ball seemed to be bouncing a bit more than usual, kind of like the field was a little harder than normal.  That being said, anyone who's grown up playing soccer in this country has a lot of experience playing on much crappier fields compared to Talen on Sunday, so this isn't exactly an issue people are going to relate to much.  Both teams played on it, deal with it.  Haris looked like he must have taken pregame steroids the way he keep over-firing on his passes and shots."

I'm worried that between now and the mid terms there is going to be a really bad school shooting.

"Melee companions and Familiars gimp the total XP you receive however, which may not be what you're after. Hence my question at the end of the post \[which I stuck as an edit  after you'd replied admittedly\].

If you're playing the game solo for max XP \[as I did\], then the melee mage early game is definitely preferable , but is you have tanks up front to take the aggro \[which may involve gimping your experience depending on where you're playing\], then going pure spell caster from the get go is probably better, as you can focus your efforts on controlling the battlefield with Mind Spells rather than having to provide Damage."
"Can only agree on what was written here, especially the Temp HP talents need some urgent rework.

Don't get me wrong, using shields finally makes sense now and you're incredibly tanky, but this is overboard. This talent needs some readjustements. 

Same applies to temp hp on cleave with weapons like Dual Swords, you outheal any damage you could possibly take. 

On the other hand, temp hp for kills is pathetic, especially during hords you need to be incredibly careful as to not get rekt instantly because slave rats and fanatics don't heal you for shit. (Also, RIP Boon of Shallya? Didn't see any increase of healing whatsoever)"

"Hay una misconception muy común muy inducida entre los divulgadores de la relatividad, de que el ""tiempo"" pasa más rápido o despacio de acuerdo a como nos movemos. Eso no es cierto en realidad, vos, en tu marco de referencia propio (vos te ves quieto siempre a vos mismo) vas a ver el tiempo pasando igual siempre, de un segundo en un segundo. Esto es así tanto en la relatividad especial como general. Lo que ocurre es que si querés comparar relojes con alguien que tuvo un estado de movimiento distinto, vas a encontrar diferencias de acuerdo a cómo se movieron, es decir el tiempo es relativo (pero no sé relentiza). El error suele venir por mirar la coordenada t en las transformaciones de Lorentz, y ver que se hace más chica, pero eso es un error, esa coordenada t no tiene NINGÚN significado físico (es solo un auxiliar para hacer la cuenta), el único tiempo con significado físico es el tiempo propio (el que medis en tu propio marco de referencia), y la relatividad te dice cómo va a diferir el reloj de cada uno de acuerdo a cómo nos movamos. Este tipo de misconception se van cuando estudias relatividad general, pero como es bastante más difícil la gente suele hacer divulgación solo de la relatividad especial donde queda enmascarado el fenómeno por otra coordenada t que no es fisica.

Por ejemplo, si vos te vas en una nave cerca de la velocidad de la luz respecto a la tierra, pegas una vuelta durante un año tuyo y volves, vos vas a sentir que pasó solo un año, pero en la tierra capaz pasaron mil.

Respecto a ""que no pase el tiempo"", es decir hacer tu tiempo propio nulo (que es el tiempo que vos sentís en definitiva), la teoría te predice que eso es imposible, necesitarías energía infinita (tanto la relatividad especial como general), siempre vas a sentir pasando el tiempo igual.

Respecto a volver atrás, la relatividad especial lo prohíbe, pero la relatividad general ""en principio"" lo permite. Para volver atrás nunca vas particularmente rápido, podes hacerlo a velocidades comunes (la velocidad en definitiva no es importante para viajar en el tiempo), lo que importa es la ""forma global"" del espacio, y que esta forma te permita ""dar la vuelta"" sin necesidad de viajar para atrás (por ejemplo si vivís en una esfera podes seguir adelante y volver al mismo punto).  Estás soluciones, si bien existen, todas las que se conocen o son inestables o requieren materia con propiedades tan raras nunca vistas, que es razonable pensar que no existe. Es un problema abierto determinar si bajo suposiciones físicamente razonables estás soluciones tipo máquina del tiempo no están permitidas en realidad.

Para entender un poco a que me refiero con ""forma global del espacio"", este [libro](https://www.mediafire.com/file/aeefd1wxkr1f2ru/The_Shape_of_Space_2nd_Edition.pdf/file) de divulgación está bastante bueno. Hay un par más de divulgación más de relatividad que compartí en otra respuesta también por si te interesa."

First sighted around 5:30. Seen in flock with Canada. Faint white speckling on neck and face with bright white front of face, acting as a rim around the base of the bill. Orange legs. Breast is browner than others. Neck is mostly white. Face around eyes is a dull brownish gray. Seems to be larger than others with longer neck. Swims with tail cocked up slightly more than others. Seems to have black cap contrasting mostly pale face. All coloration except for what is listed is the same as Canada.

Edit: Despite how different it looks in this picture, it looked very similar to the Canada geese. When it was swimming, it looked like a partially leucistic Canada goose. The orange legs are what alerted me in the first place."

"**Star Citizen**

Star Citizen is an upcoming massively multiplayer, space trading and combat game developed and published by Cloud Imperium Games for Microsoft Windows. Development of the game began in 2011 led by director Chris Roberts, and is being mostly financed from a large crowdfunding campaign. The game's full launch was originally anticipated to be in 2014, but significant expansion of gameplay features have led to postponement. Squadron 42, a single-player story driven game set in the same universe as Star Citizen, is also being developed.

most people are going to want a bone farm anyway so why not? and what if you already do have one?
"you talk about Canadian NBA Players in the title, but then go on to say Canadian teams who maybe not be owned by a Canadian per se. The Canadian players are international

Either way, if something isnt from the U.S. its from another Nation.... thats where the National from Inter-national comes from"
It's kind of weird to see people picking up demons souls for the first time now.  I remember going to the store and buying it when it released.  Didn't realize it was so under the radar until Dark Souls had people talking about it.  I even bought the Japanese release because it created a separate trophy list and it's a really easy platinum once you understand the game and know some of the shortcuts. Plus I wanted to see the souls glitch.

That’s nice 
"I worked at a had station a few years ago, and one day a regular customer of ours asked me to pick him a $1 scratcher. He ended up winning $200 on it and bought them every day after that. Even though I didn't directly cause his addiction, I still felt horrible when he would come to buy more."

Thanks for taking your time to reply! I am the same as of now in the fact that i seem to mostly have GI and sinus issues. I am actually being tested for diabetes at my next appointment just to be sure I do not have it. They do not think I do which I'm thankful for because I know how hard diabetes is as my Aunt has type 1. I very much appreciate your support and advice! 
So what’s different about this than just marking a red ‘x’ on the calaender when I hit a certain goal for the day?
I'm glad you like it! unfortunately venmo doesnt exist in Canada
Ahh sorry my bad 
"Yes, I felt in need of some therapy today as well.  Sometimes laughing with strangers helps.  :)"
I don't know what that is but have you tried using bleach to kill it?
"Get real this is just the latest in a very long long line of a Trump supporter and right wing terrorists.  They’ve killed people, there's your real damage dick."

"Haha whoa there tiger. But really, why keep to one per comment if they would need to go hand in hand to work most effectively?"
"Okay, so all in all its pretty much equivalent in bass with a single loop vs no loop BnB.

I used the same combo for both I'll leave the annotations here;

No loop: IAD h&gt;5L&gt;2M&gt;5M&gt;JLML&gt;J2H&gt;SD&gt;JLML&gt;J2H&gt;jump cancel&gt;JLLL (builds a bar and 1/4th 3.8k or so)

One loop in base: IAD H&gt;5L&gt;5M&gt;TK 236M&gt;5L( one hit)&gt;JLML&gt;J2H&gt;SD&gt;JLML&gt;jump cancel&gt; JLLL (builds a bar and 1/3 3.6k or so)

Two loop potential lvl 1:
IAD H&gt;5L&gt;5M&gt;TK 236M&gt;3L&gt;JL&gt;J236M&gt;3H&gt;JLM&gt;J2H&gt;SD&gt;JLML&gt;J2H&gt;jump cancel&gt;JLLL (builds a bar and 2/3 3.6k or so)

Damage wise or optimal wise, its easier and more reliable to go BnB in most situations I believe. since you can initiate a combo with 2M, leading to close to 4k with a BnB and meter gain isn't significant. And corners can also begin with a 2m leading to 6k with only 2loops and one bar.

But if you want to style, there is the additional meter gain, which is a nice cherry."

Could that have anything to do with demographics in areas where those sports are common?
It needs some mechanism where teams can't go feck this KC are too good let's get some picks for our veterans and loose out. Shit ain't right. 
So if you knew that the baby you were gonna have would suffer in pure pain and agony for six whole months you'd force it into that life even tho you had the choice to make sure it wouldn't have to go through all that?

Haha well spotted! Yep. Been riding my whole life. Just bought a new bike a few weeks ago actually. Had a crazy expensive Santa Cruz which I sold because it was way overkill for the riding I do these days.

Apparently the Juno &amp; Co velvet sponges are great and waste a lot less product so for makeup artists it makes a huge difference. 
Yup that would’ve been me. Even with a pistol. 
Do what you feel comfortable with doing. You’ll get the hang of it eventually and come into your own.

Someone I dated forever put on about 90lbs over the case of four years. We tried to work it out but in the end she decided that the ""healthy at every size"" thing was more her cup of tea and I just couldn't do it any more. I still adored them as a person but I need physical affection in a relationship and I couldn't get that with her because I wasn't into it. It's a heartbreaking situation for everyone involved. "

"It's worth noting that it's the leader of R.A.M. (Robert Rundo) who was arrested, as well as two other members. There's a fourth person who currently remains at large. All four men are being charged with traveling to incite or participate in riots, similarly to the four already indicted. "

"Yes, resistances are definitely important, but it's case by case situation. Against ghosts Sabin's damage is decently good, but it doesn't mean Sabin is decently good everywhere. In the same way, if I'm doing a list that wants to be the most generic possible, I ignore particular edge cases and only take into account what I'm most likely going to face. That's why there's a long list and not only three or four names: against most enemies, who are neutral, Setzer is likely going to fare better than Kuja. If there are physical resistant enemies, then scroll the list until you find mages, so Kuja is going to do more damage and bringing him instead might be a better idea."
