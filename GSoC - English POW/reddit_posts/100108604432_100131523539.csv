"dude I wish it was that simple to leave the country. the vast majority of our country is so poor that they never even left the country. our minimum wage is about 3000 USD **per year** and our statistics institute says that more than half the country lives with LESS than that. in order to switch countries most countries require you to have enough money to sustain yourself there for a while, and a job offer. this ""sustain yourself there for a while"" is incredibly expensive for us, even for the upper class. for comparison, my family is part of the so called ""class B-A"": this means that we make more money than 85% of the population, yet we still can't afford to move to a developed country.

even if you're part of the 1% that can sustain yourself there until you find a job, you'd need to be able to speak their language in order to get the job offer. between 3 and 5% of Brazilians speak a good English, and the rest only speak Portuguese. we're all stuck on this country, unfortunately"

"Not sure about how useful it would be for pushing and pulling, but maybe it could function like a well-placed foot for the purposes of tripping since you don‚Äôt really need to pull anyone to make it happen (people trip on lighter things all the time, after all.)

Side note about the utility of Mage Hand: I had a player in one of my recent games who played an Arcane Trickster, so he had the enhanced invisible Mage Hand. I was skeptical about how useful it would really be to him, but he and the party druid teamed up to do stuff that had me scrambling to come up with all kinds of ad hoc rules. I love that kind of teamwork and creativity so I didn‚Äôt mind, but it was hard to keep up with at times (for example, druid casts Heat Metal on a mace and rogue‚Äôs Mage Hand flies around touching people with it while they are safely hidden; I ended up treating it as a melee touch attack to keep things simple.)

Anyway, the point is that the players made me aware of all kinds of environmental things that a single hand can do instead of directly grabbing the opponent (e.g., open/close doors of windows, tip a bucket of marbles by a staircase, push a bar of soap across a wet floor, pull a vine on the ground taut to it becomes a tripwire, etc.)  Most of the best uses relied on stealth to work, but it can still be useful in the thick of battle as a nuisance/distraction. A lot of it depends on how rich and detailed your description of the environment is. The more material they have to work with, the more likely they‚Äôll go full-blown Jackie Chan and use it on their enemies. That applies to pretty much all facets of combat besides Mage Hand too, of course. 

Speaking of which: Maybe I‚Äôm a glutton for punishment, but their ideas were so awesome that I came up with a simple homebrew magic item for him to find in the next adventure. It‚Äôs basically a ring (common) that you wear on your off-hand When the wearer casts Mage Hand the ring creates a second one to work with the first (so it doubles the carrying capacity and push/pull, but more importantly it allows them to do stuff that requires two hands from a distance.)"

And he even mentioned that it could come from people who actually support the targets, but that nothing could be determined now and they will follow the facts to a conclusion instead of assuming. Of course the MSNBC host lady was not happy about this as she had been beating the far-right drum the whole time leading up to this.

"Things that are driving healthcare costs in the US: 1. The obesity epidemic, including an 800% increase in severe obesity(BMI of 40+) between 1960 and 2016. Obesity is associated with a wide variety of health problems, most of which are chronic and expensive in nature. 2. The US subsidizing pharma development for the entire world 3. Massive overregulation. Half of all paragraphs in the law are dedicated towards healthcare. Each new bill that is passed is thousands of pages long. In a free market prices generally fall over time. Your iphone is cheaper/better than it was a few years ago. On the other hand we have seen a massive increase in the price of education, healthcare and housing, all three of which have multiple government interventions at work."

"Actually, I was in class when one of the protesters passed by and asked the professor of she could take 5 mins to tell us about the protest and such.

She was a trainwreck. No arguments, just spewed uninformed hate.

At one point, a student asked ""well, all we know is that he was once affiliated with a hebrew university, and we do know that he's spoken against Israel's arguments for their actions. Do you have any reason to believe he is otherwise a zionist?""

Her answer (almost verbatim): ""well have you heard of [dude whose name I forgot]? He was in the IDF, it was his job for years, and then he realized what they were doing and he gave up his israeli passport for a UK one. He's a hero. This guy? He's just pretending to speak against Israel when in fact he's a traitor. Other dude was a hero!""

"I'm actually doing a last minute budget trip to Europe in mid-Nov as well and had the same issue of needing to fly into a major western European city (a really good deal on flights from the US popped up, but it didn't apply to any cities further east). I ended up choosing to fly into Munich because I could travel by train or bus easily (and cheaply) from there to Prague. Vienna would also put you within a 4-5 hour train or bus ride from Prague. 

Either way, it might be worth considering your city to fly into based on its proximity to a more affordable city. It could open up more possible destinations."

"Replying to the update. 

Not trying to prove the vet's innocence or anything, just adding perspective based on my experience. 

(1) Just as an FYI, not all blood work machines have settings for ""rabbit"" so the values may be flagged because they are being compared to ""normal cat"" values or something like that, and some of those readings may in fact be in a normal range for rabbits. 

(2) not all cancer is created equally. Cancer can do anything. It can also do nothing. 

(3) If a client initiated actions that are consistent with pursuing legal action (eg requesting hard copies of all the records after a death), I would attempt to minimize the clinic's liability and therefore instruct my staff to limit communication with the owner and always refer the client directly to me. 

(4) I'd be surprised if other vets are willing to write documented medical evaluations based on the paperwork alone. Without seeing the live patient or performing a necropsy, they don't have a valid doctor-patient-client relationship, which is legally required in all states in order to provide specific veterinary medical advice. 

Good luck with whatever decision you choose to pursue. Again, sorry for your loss. "

"This is one of the few times I can see RP being relevant in a reddit thread. 3k RP isnt high enough to match make with people over 40BR or 50BR so its filled with people who are late to the pvp ladder or play casually. Gogeta's counter will absolutely work well in casual ranks/pvp since people don't know better and dont play nearly as much as higher ranked players.

Once you breach 40BR, you'll get matchmade with people who play the game a lot more and a chance to Matchmake with top 100 players who don't use long distance strike cards which would give gogeta a reasonable amount of time to counter with his green card. 

As the guy before me said, if most players use a strike card from a long range, they'll most likely cancel it since it gives the opponent way too much time to react anything, including rr or bait a vanish step.

If I had to give my two cents, gogeta's green card would work great in low rank/casual settings but would be much more difficult to make efficient use of in high rank scenarios where people are more experienced and use tactics that would just indirectly counter gogeta's green card anyway."

"*...There is mass popular opposition to Trump‚Äôs policies of war, anti-immigrant chauvinism, authoritarianism and austerity. But it can find no expression within the two-party system dominated by the American corporate-financial oligarchy. The Democrats are neither willing nor able to make an appeal to the broad discontent and opposition in the working class. They ignore the central social and class issues that concern the broad majority of the population, centered on the immense growth of social inequality.*

*They represent another entirely reactionary faction of the same ruling class. Their constituency is Wall Street, the national security agencies and privileged layers of the middle class...*

*...Trump‚Äôs speech must be taken by the working class as a warning. It points up the urgent need to break with the Democrats and the entire two-party system and build the Socialist Equality Party as the leadership of a mass socialist movement.*

Imagine what that does to a country's mentality. 150 years of the same two parties, sharing power with each other, linking arms to prevent challengers from rising. It's not democracy. The Duopoly is leaving Americans no option but to revolt."

"&gt;You‚Äôre wrong. As long as the program continues, you‚Äôre telling them they NEED help. That the deck is stacked against them. The psychological effect is powerful. The only way to fix it is to treat them as EQUALS. Within 1-2 generations of equality all racial hatred would be gone. Affirmative action only breeds animosity between races and an inferiority complex in the AA community. They don‚Äôt need your help. They‚Äôre quite capable of being successful without your liberal virtue signaling.

Oh yeah? Then why is it that it's been 1-2 generations since the Civil Rights Movement and we still have ridiculous amounts of socioeconomic inequality between races and [unconscious racism?](http://www.uh.edu/~adkugler/Bertrand&amp;Mullainathan.pdf)

They do need our help. They're underrepresented **even with** affirmative action. How would taking away affirmative action lead to them getting more representation in white-collar professional environments? It's like going to a poor person, taking away their food stamps, and saying 'hey, you're capable of being successful without these.' How would that make any sense whatsoever? 

Also, there's not really animosity between races. I'm Asian myself and while it's a topic of debate within our community, the vast majority of us are quite aware of the fact that the Affirmative Action debate is a way for white people to do something favorable for themselves under the guise of trying to help out Asians.  

&gt;It‚Äôs the same thing with ID‚Äôs. Have you seen that video where the guy goes around asking blacks people if they have ID‚Äôs? Of course they do lol! Why wouldn‚Äôt they be able to get an ID?!? Liberals just beat down the black community and tell them they can‚Äôt succeed because they‚Äôre not equal. We want equality.

Nobody is saying that black people **cant** succeed without help. However, it's MUCH harder. Thanks to segregation, black people tend to live in places with worse schools, higher levels of crime, and have less help from parents (because the parents themselves have a higher likelihood of having no higher education / being in poverty).

You try going to a kid (doesn't matter what race) and telling them that they should put their heads down and study when nobody around them is and let me know how that goes."
"If I understand correctly, you've ""been together"" with your ""girlfriend"" for 8 months without ever meeting her in person and this will be the first time? Is she also your first everything?  

Your mom isn't in the wrong here when she says she wants you to try out relationships and sort yourself out emotionally, she's being an experienced adult. She isn't saying you ought to go into relationships with the aim of using your first couple of partners as tools to further yourself, but simply to let everything run its natural course, instead of daydreaming about grandiose multi-year plans with a person you've never even met. That natural course being whatever life throws at you. But it's very, very, very unlikely that it will be eternal love with the first girl that gave you two glimpses. 

As for this trip, do it, but without the grand romantic fantasies you are harboring. Because it will be awkward. So awkward. And that's to be expected, triply so from online relationships of this particular type. 

And as a Hungarian, when you say her family has money issues what are we talking here? Averagely middle class 'poor' as most Hungarians are, who couldn't spot $3k for their child's transcontinental holiday idea but are otherwise doing okay or are they considered poor even locally? Going a year without asking any financial favors is a good sign she could be legit, but nonetheless be very wary of any story that would end in you parting with any money and giving it to them. Scams like this do happen worldwide and this region of the world is no different. Even on reddit, I encountered this twice, with random guys coming for advice to r/hungary on whether the poor, tortured, beautiful Hungarian soul they've been talking to for months is honest or not when she's asking them to help not lose their house or pay for cancer treatment.

"Enthusiasm isn't a reasonable metric for consent because it is subjective. A no is definitely not subjective so the part where he repeatedly asked her is where he went wrong here. If you think I'm being obtuse to think that enthusiasm is subjective and some people may think people are enthusiastic when they are actually not. Think about where we are right now that someone was able to coerce someone into something without realising they had done something wrong, so I feel its fairly reasonable to assume people will have very different views of enthusiasm. Which is why telling people that no means no is more helpful than using enthusiasm."

"Ok, but this was also written on Tesla's website that reservation holders will still get priority access over those without if they are ordering the same configuration and in the same area. Not a huge benefit, but they've said it and wrote it multiple times so I'd terms to believe them.

That being said, are we even sure they'll do reservations for the Model Y? We can all agree reservations for the TM3 was a bit of a fiasco and caused more anger than excitement. People are trying to estimate how many reservations they get for the Y, some going as high as a million, but I just hope they decide to do away with it and do first come first serve. They probably enjoyed the interest free loans, but in the end I think it hurt their brand a bit."

We can count the number of notable cases on one hand and of these notable cases the evidence for true communication is dubious at best. The nail in the coffin is that there is no current research on the topic - if this was a legitimate area of primatology it would have *increased* in scope of research, adding more evidence and data to back these claims of ASL speaking apes.

"Canadian here, dated a SK immigrant for a good while. SK (and most, if not all SE Asian nations) is repressive as fuck, it‚Äôs saddening really. In Korea the weird Neo-Christian cult lobbies (mainly Moonies but there‚Äôs a whole plethora of them, and they‚Äôre all trying to out-control freak each other) made so that the Govt cracked down on petty shit like masturbation or light drug use. You can get thrown in jail for smoking cannabis once.  If I remember correctly you can even get two years for getting caught jacking it to fairly softcore stuff. 

It‚Äôs even worse when you realize that a gigantic chunk of the population isn‚Äôt religious at all (and another good chuck practice other, non-cultish religions such as Buddhism or regular Christianity) but they still can‚Äôt get away from those ultra-conservative laws. Thing is a lot of younger people are more relaxed on those issues but they rarely openly talk about it, so it will inevitably change in the next decade or so as the old people who hold these lobbies start dying. I think Korea is likely on the verge of a major cultural shift because a lot of the youth is nearing a breaking point : societal pressures are purely insane and have generated a gigantic mental health problem that is only worsened by the freakish and unhealthy laws of the oligarchy.

Surely you have a record to share with us all that would save you the embarrassment of being a hypocrite and a liar. 

I'm suggesting we all get a lesson in how to do this right. You can teach us. It should be no brainier, just share the research you regularly do, point by point, that explains how you arrive at your decisions. You definitely have that saved somewhere with links, right?

I was too young to really understand why the sequels were bad and I was really into the action parts of the movies. I was on the edge of my seat during the mech battle scene, but it really doesn't hold up now. There really is something special about the first movie and the expanded lore of the sequels gives them a totally different flavor than the first one. I guess the first one had a noir/mystery aspect that the sequels didn't have."

She then asked me if I had anything crappy going on in my life because sometimes psychological issues can manifest as pain. She is very very lucky I didn‚Äôt punch her in her stupid face. I just got up and left. The next dr I went to had me on the surgery table within a few weeks of my first appt- he told me after my hysterectomy and excision surgery that I should have never been left in the condition I was in. My uterus was 4x the size it should have been from the adeno, my ovary was twisted and attached behind my uterus, I was anemic from the blood loss, etc. I sent that former dr my surgery report and asked her if she wasn‚Äôt sure she had some psychological issues that she was manifesting onto patients üòÇüòÇ I didn‚Äôt get a response.

"&gt;**My question or request is just a clear explanation on Metasploit routing mechanics**

If you would have kept digging where you already were, I think you would have found this--

[https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/testing/post-exploitation-metasploit-pivot-port-33909](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/testing/post-exploitation-metasploit-pivot-port-33909)

After finding that, I went and looked here--

[https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/lib/rex/post/meterpreter/extensions/stdapi/net/route.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/lib/rex/post/meterpreter/extensions/stdapi/net/route.rb)

And it seems like your assumption about just storing network information and assigning it an ID (tunnel ID, according to SANS), would be correct.

&gt;**implies that sometimes the tool being used must be proxy aware or at least transparently proxified via proxychains or tsocks**.

Correct. Some ways in which code is executed on a Windows machine remotely are or are not proxy aware. This is important when encountering entities that only allow egress traffic out of their network through an authenticated proxy. One would of course need to choose a payload that is ""proxy aware"". If you're trying to push your traffic from your machine through another compromised machine, then what you said above is true.

&gt;**Also, is there a resource on iptables commands for the red team?**

`git clone` [`https://github.com/leostat/rtfm`](https://github.com/leostat/rtfm)

`cd rtfm`

`chmod +x` [`rtfm.py`](https://rtfm.py)

`python` [`rtfm.py`](https://rtfm.py) `-c iptables`

Books more specific to iptables may help or something more practical like searching github for ""iptables"" and looking at how people are using and creating rules.

&gt;**I am also exploring the capabilities of Proxy ARP Daemons as a pentest tool...**  Is this a viable pentester tactic?

To be sure I understand this correctly, you have a connection from the corporate switch, going into the attacker's device. The attacker's device then has a wireless NIC that is connected to a compromised wireless network, and the other connection from the attacker's device sends the Ethernet on to the corporate computer. That sounds like it would work, yes, if you want to do it that way. A solution that wouldn't have any extra equipment and work on a laptop would be to carry something similar to a [Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe), find an unlocked laptop, and run something like what I have below as an admin:

`netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=""allow"" ssid=""JetPack MiFi 6194"" key=""Password123HahaOk456""`

`netsh wlan start hostednetwork`

`net start SharedAccess`

Then just enable Sharing in the Network Interface properties to ""Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection.""  If you did this in your example, you would then be able to hit a device on the local network of the computer configured to share the connection that was not connected to the wireless AP you stood up.

For additional research, your idea sounds similar to the [Poison Tap Project by Samy Kamkar](https://samy.pl/poisontap/). Your idea also has a similar functionality to a Network Access Control (NAC) bypass (e.g. [https://github.com/p292/NACKered](https://github.com/p292/NACKered))."

The only question then becomes who would pay the employer side of the premium? Could maybe get a flat fee from new employer and you then have the option to join their plan or pay the difference (if any) to keep you existing plan. Either way, anyway to creat more competition to drive the prices down would be a win in my book.

"I don't see why that shouldn't be allowed. If you only feel the need/desire to write a review for things you do not recommend, then that should be your right.

Same with a Curator. If people feel that this curator's tastes align with their own, then having his negative reviews available to them is just as useful. Could it be more useful if he wore recommendations he likes? (maybe its a she, but i'll stick to he) That would be something we can argue about. I mean a lot of people might not be willing to subscribe to the curator if they found out they liked games they didn't.. even though they agreed on all their dislikes, that could lead to somebody not subscribing.

Its a choice. Its a choice to subscribe to this guy. Its a choice of his not to write positive recommendations. I do not see why this shouldn't be allowed.

The content of his ""recommendations""... is hardly any more or less useful than the billion ""10/10 would play again"" nonsense reviews people write."

I use the DC with reduce recoil and the explosive ammo perk makes it's a really powerful gun with it, and with the grenade card, barrage card and regen health card it makes it better then assault in most scenarios imo. If you haven't unlocked everything for the class yet I would recommend playing blast to level up your cards and weapon attachments faster and it's great practice if you don't have your headshots on lock because getting headshots does more damage.

Same with heroes you're going to want to play HvV to level your heroes because at base level they're pretty weak."

"&gt; I dont really know any good solution as I am writing this post.  
  
Powercreep will always be an issue. What I've been thinking about is having weapons have 'capped' damage in lower boss encounters/slayer, while being uncapped in the latest (few) newer bosses. For example a new t95 weapon could have its damage capped at t92 if you're doing anything lower than telos/solak/aod. But for anything higher it could be uncapped (might also get rid of the 15k dmg cap) at anything higher than the t92 dropping bosses.  
  
Maybe give it lore touch that the 'older bosses have seen enough death by the hands of Gielinorians to shield themself from the additional damage."

The alternate timeline
I think attempted murder is a state crime.
"Interestingly enough, the best team in club history might have been South Melbourne's side in the 1930s, made the Grand Final four times in a row (though only won the first one). Had Bob Pratt absolutely monstering teams at full-forward (kicked 150 goals in a single season once, equal highest for a season in VFL/AFL history), and had some brilliant midfielders in the form of Laurie Nash and Brownlow-medallist Herbie Matthews. Shame they only had one flag to show for it though.

These days, I reckon the 2012 side is still the best team the Swans have fielded in recent years. The sides fielded in 2013-14 onwards may have had more talent, but the 2012 side had the best balance of polish and grit IMO, with the speed of younger players like Hannebery and Jetta complemented by the grunt of the likes of O'Keefe and Bolton. Plus, we still had Mumford playing for us then (no ruckman since has been anywhere near as good for us). Still, might wait and see how the current team gels in the next few years, enormous potential in the squad"

"It's easy to put Notch on a pedestal, but the guy had his issues. Resisted community influence on features, something pretty core to minecraft now, and safe to say it was Jeb who encouraged that. Notch literally sold out. Nothing wrong with that, but I mean if anything it makes him more responsible. He chose to sell it to a massive company. Jeb didn't leave. Java edition doesn't have microtransactions. The microsoft version, the version Notch enabled, does.

But yeah, microtransactions suck. All of those things suck in any game their in. That said, there's a reason all of these games use a currency instead of direct purchases, in that it's easier on them. You have people all over the world buy the universal currency, and then all they have to process is that one currency. Still predatory. ~~The purchase amounts ensure you're likely to end up with extra (but not enough) to try to get you to buy more coins.~~ ^^*maybe* ^^*not* But the concept of a currency itself makes sense."

"&gt; So...you're admitting you are wrong and now attempting to save face with an attack?

I'm admitting you understood me wrong. The original post I replied to said ""socialism is a moderate and generally accepted political ideology in 76% of the Western World.""

&gt;LOL. I've worked a number of small businesses. The bartending job was great because the owner would help out by getting drunk and letting me drink too.

Did you and the other bartenders advocate taking the bar from the owner (violence if he didn't comply)? That's socialism.

&gt;By build, I'm talking about physically changing something into something more valuable. They hire people for that shit.

My boss started alone, at nights, built his business himself. It's 30 years later now and he still works 60 hours a week. He just invested in new snowplows, borrowing $100k. If it snows all winter, he'll be rich, and if it doesn't, he'll be broke. His 25 employees won't be broke, but we didn't risk anything.

&gt;&gt;My town has an actual socialist history--several mayors. In the 80s when unions controlled our politics they had all the factories paying unskilled labor as much as white-collars with college degrees. Unions could strike for 2 months before factories could hire scabs. And then the factory jobs disappeared like a fart in the wind and never came back. Great job, labor!

&gt;You'd almost think that after several decades and the gutting of labor in the 70s, it may have been related to something else...NAFTA cough.

Labor was a political behemoth in my town until the factories left and NAFTA was in 1994, so neither.

&gt;My pops lost his blue collar gig in the mid 1990s when they moved to Japan. He wasn't union though.

What company? Moving overseas was mostly caused by union political excess. People complain about money in politics, but unions outspent everyone in those days and people thought it was free speech. They still spend quite a bit.

&gt;Blaming labor doesn't account for, ya know, globalization, that thing that labor militantly opposed before the right coopted it.

If you're anti-globalist, you're no true socialist. Welcome to the good side, which, bonus, [is also the winning side](https://www.heritage.org/index/ranking)."

"I‚Äôm curious what the correct distinction between the two actually is, if you wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing!

I always assumed that Scandinavian referred to the language family consisting of Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish.  This would obviously exclude Finland since Finnish is a language of the Uralic family (a completely separate family from the indo-European derived language family), which makes sense.  However, I don‚Äôt think Iceland is considered a Scandinavian country though it‚Äôs language is also a Scandinavian language.  Same is true for the Faroe Islands, i think. 

What really throws me off is that Nordic often indicates the language family descended from old north Germanic or Norse languages, which Finland isn‚Äôt part of. So Finland doesn‚Äôt seem like it should be called Nordic either. 

Thus I have to assume it‚Äôs a distinction that is probably not based on the linguistic family. 

So what‚Äôs the proper distinction to someone who lives in that region?  Is Scandinavian a subset of Nordic countries or are they two separate designations?  Which countries are Nordic and which are Scandinavian?

"Card games arent pay to win. They are pay to play.

U said having a cap doesnt make it less pay to win.

Yes it does. Absolutely. U cannot keep paying money to win more. You do need to pay X money to compete tho. That doesnt make it pay to win.

Literally, literally, everything not totally free is pay to win by your definition. Basketball? Pay to win, u need to pay for the ball to compete.

This game? Not pay to win. Pay x to play, then paying is capped. Its just, like magic, on the 'golf' side of the spectrum instead of the 'basketball' side.

App games like clash of clans? Pay to win. You can.pay and keep paying money for better\faster items, and keep doing so. Paying persons will always have an advantage over less paying persons. (Havent played clash of clans so if it isnt p2w sub it for an app that is).

Am i disappointed that over the last 15 years card games have become a luxury hobby? Absolutely.

But saying its pay to win because one person can afford jace the mindsculptor while another cannot, is total nonsense.

Cap means not pay to win. Thats all there is to it. Capitalism means everything has a cap. Even having a computer to play on is a cap. You think HS is free to play? You need a comp. So then it isnt.

Does that mean buying a better computer will give you an advantage? After a small cap (the ability to run the game), it does not. So then putting more money in doesnt increase your winrate, as far as computer cost is concerned.

Same with cards. After an initial investment (lets cap at owning/having access to all the cards), there is no advantage to spending more money.

Same. Thing.

Having access to a few cards, enough to build one competitive deck (aka the mtga and HS ftp model) doesnt mean that it isnt pay to play either. You will not be competetive if u have one deck. Yeah sure u can spike a tourney maybe. But to really be competitive, u need to ability to test and tweak. Which costs $$$. So those games are pay to play as well.   

But not pay to win."

"'Typical things' can be very simple. For example, I enjoy listening to music all the time. Today a feeling of general happiness came over me doing a mundane task whilst listening to an 80's playlist.

Songs typically make me feel emotional. When I can't find comfort or release or joy listening to music, then that is a sign of depression.

"&gt; First of all, everyone knows RB's hit the ground running in the NFL

That's why Ronald Jones and Rashaad Penny are doing so well yeah?

&gt; On top of that the ""impact"" he has had, as good as he is, is what exactly?

I think teams are selling out against the run/short passing game against you guys hardcore. Unfortunately, Eli won't throw it further than 10 for a variety of reasons, but I think that counts as a major impact beyond the stats and wins.

&gt; What people are saying is that an amazing running back isn't all that valuable in the NFL.

Yes, and I think they are wrong. Top 3 scoring offenses are KC, NO and LA all of which have an elite RB. 

Everyone likes to compare this situation to the Vikings with AP. Well the Vikings had multiple opportunities to get a QB during his 10 years there and failed every time, except for 1 year with Favre. That's not an indictment on drafting AP, he was still a good pick, that's just poor QB evaluation."

"This has always been my biggest problem with Trump in general. He doesn‚Äôt listen to experts on so  many things that the experts are vastly in agreement of. 

- Almost all economists agree Tariffs are bad. Trump establishes tariff.

- 97% of climate experts state climate change is real and being caused by humans. Trump disagrees and undermines them.

- Almost all doctors and Trumps own experts vehemently agree vaccines do not cause autism and you should get your children vaccinated. Trumps tweeted 20 times saying they are linked.

- Pretty much everyone qualified to discuss the health detriment of asbestos states it is carcinogen. Trump tries to lift ban on asbestos.

There‚Äôs a reason a lot of his advisory councils disbanded or people left, because he doesn‚Äôt take their advice. If you go against the experts over and over again, when they‚Äôre in overwhelming agreement, you‚Äôre bound to run whatever it is into the ground or cause harm to whatever it is eventually."

"What dirtypiss(lol) said.  There was a thread on a catfish discussion subreddit where someone posted ""someone told me housewife all get bored eventually, i became obsessed with the concept despite supposedly stable relationship and hunt for evidence, find no evidence then catfish my wife pretending to be the co-worker and arranged for them to have sex oh no Wat do I Do gaise i hate how aroused i am by this(seriously)"".  Stories like this come off fake because there's just...too much emphasis on a ""here is a high-importance relationship (wife, in this case planning to have kids with them) that gets totally rekd by this much cheating going on and thanks to this narrative contrivance I was able to get in on all the juicy painful details"".  Normal concerned people just relay 'sorry but x is cheating on you' or the recipient gets the cheating confession, not fucking recordings and shit.  In the first case it was with...well catfishing and seeing firsthand the cheating go down, in this story its' that the cheating is literally recorded and the husband is given the recordings.  At no point is it raised in these fantasy retellings ""man what if this recording-without-consent business makes me a creep"" because they're way too engrossed in 'must hurt cucks manpenis as much as possible'.

&amp;#x200B;

They try to go for gold in the high-value-relationship that gets ruined by the cheating and the level of the cheating and the contrivances allowing them maximum exposure to what's going on (Recordings) and it starts to not add up.  this shit is why 'joe shut up and get the fuck out im going to fuck your wife now' was a meme for a bit a lot of the content is just...really transparent and ridiculous?

"&gt; California is again recording the most expensive state superintendent election in history, with a cast of billionaires who are outspending the teachers unions in support of a former charter schools executive.

It has no legislative authority but would be an important symbolic victory for the charter school movement. The role has long been eyed as a school choice prize for education policy watchers who see its potential to influence state education policy nationally.

Every single girl I know that actually knows her 

body can cum easily. They will cum in minutes 

and keep cumming. It's very enjoyable sex. 

I honestly have to agree here: Many girls do lack a 

sex-positive, non-repressed mindset (in which 

case they should meditate on that, practice and 

resolve those mental blockades) or put more 

effort into getting to know their bodies. 

I had relationships with girls who genuinely never 

masturbated and don't want to masturbate. 

Well... then sex is difficult for the guy because he 

can't make up for your lack of experience and 

things wi be much less enjoyable for you as you 

can't even explain what drives you wild. 

Having sex with women like that is like dancing 

with a person who just noticed they have legs for 

the first time.

""O que ele falou √© a pura verdade. A gente tem que reconectar com a periferia, com a dor que as pessoas est√£o sofrendo"", disse Haddad.

 O candidato √© alvo de cr√≠ticas dentro do pr√≥prio PT por ter supostamente dado pouca aten√ß√£o √† periferia, base hist√≥rica do partido, em sua passagem pela prefeitura.

 Haddad comemorou o resultado da pesquisa Ibope/**Estado**/TV Globo, [**divulgada nesta ter√ßa-feira**](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,ibope-bolsonaro-tem-57-dos-votos-validos-e-haddad-43,70002560490), durante ato no Largo da Batata, em S√£o Paulo. O petista registrou 51% das inten√ß√µes de voto na capital paulista contra 49% do candidato do PSL, [**Jair Bolsonaro**](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/jair-bolsonaro), e elogiou o ex-presidente do [**PSDB**](https://tudo-sobre.estadao.com.br/psdb-partido-da-social-democracia-brasileira) **Alberto Goldmann** por ter declarado voto no PT. O com√≠cio reuniu milhares de pessoas.

 O candidato tamb√©m comemorou o resultado nacional da pesquisa, que mostra a queda de quatro pontos percentuais em rela√ß√£o a Bolsonaro, a quem chamou de ""frouxo"" por ter se recusado a participar de debates no segundo turno. Sobre o crescimento entre o eleitorado evang√©lico, Haddad disse que √© um reflexo das mentiras disseminadas pela campanha do rival.

"Hey here's a guide I wrote up for the players coming back into the game. Hopefully it helps you out. Point 11 and 13 should help. 

1.	‚Å†Go look up the r/thesilphroad returning guide.
2.	‚Å†**Don't evolve a Magikarp because you have to do it for the mew quest line on stage 6/8** doing so before doesn't count.
3.	‚Å†You can get 50 coins **max** a day from gyms. This number doesn't roll over and does not increase in any way. If a Pokemon is in a gym for 300 days it only gets 50 coins when coming back. If you have 6 Pokemon coming back in a day you only get 50 coins not 300.
4.	‚Å†Golden razz can be fed to Pokemon from far away to heal that Pokemon to full health in gyms. This is the reason it keeps healing up when you battle it.
5.	‚Å†Celebi quest starts when you hit stage 4/8 of Mew quest. Both quests never end. Every account gets one each of the mythical Pokemon. They cannot be traded.
6.	‚Å†Use poke genie (iOS or Android) calcyiv (Android) to check IVs. Yes they are allowed and will not get you banned.
7.	‚Å†The mass evolving thing still works (you get 500 XP per evolve and double with a lucky egg) but adding 115 friends and getting them to best friends (163,000 XP per friend) gets you the XP you need to go from level 1-40 in 90 days (that's how long it takes to get to best friends). This is all without using a lucky egg.
8.	‚Å†Don't use stardust until you hit level 30 because you'll find Pokemon up to level 35 with weather boost in the wild at level 30+. Also don't level up Pokemon to higher than 30-33 unless you have less people in your groups. Leveling a Pokemon from 1-30 costs around 100,000 stardust and 30-40 costs 150,000 stardust. The damage difference between 30 and 40 is about 10%. If that 10% is worth 150,000 stardust use it but you can level up two Pokemon to 30 and do more damage as a team. Also all players level 30 and above get the same wild Pokemon. All Pokemon will have the same CP/IV/level. 
9.	‚Å†Trading can only be done &lt;100meters or 328 feet away from each other. So no you cannot trade regionals from other countries unless you're standing next to the person. Also trading a Pokemon will **completely re roll it's IVs** so don't trade a 100% thinking it'll stay a 100% cause it won't. Trading low IV/high CP is the good way to try and get high CP/high IV Pokemon. It only costs 100 stardust per normal trade. Also traded Pokemon are locked after trade and can never be traded again. Shiny and legendary and new dex Pokemon trades can only be done once a day and are more expensive. Lucky Pokemon give a floor of 12/12/12 and can happen at any time with trading
10.	‚Å†If you need friends in the game go to r/PokemonGoTrades and you can open 20 gifts a day which will help you as a rural person (or not). Best time to open gifts otherwise is at night especially if you don't want the eggs. If the person has a blue border on their picture that means that the friendship has leveled up that day already so **do not open their gifts** cause it'll be a waste of a gift cause you can only level up once a day per friendship.
11.	‚Å†Learn how to ""lock the circle"" and ""fast catch"". Go YouTube for these things.
12.	‚Å†Every 7 stamps you get you get the Pokemon of the month. This month it is Suicune. If you play everyday you get this Pokemon 4-5 times a month. You can delete research tasks by clicking the trash icon on them.
13.	‚Å†Raiding is battling a boss. 1-2 * raids can be soloed 3* can sometimes be soloed and 4-5 * cannot. You will have to find people to beat those. Join your local discord thesilphroad.com/maps to find your closest one.
14.	‚Å†Community days are 3 hour events that will spawn one Pokemon everywhere (others will spawn also). You can get a shiny of that Pokemon on a rate of 1/25. After the event the shiny rate goes back to 1/450 like it is for all wild Pokemon. If you evolve **during the event** (or one hour after) you'll get a special move that you can only get during the event. These moves are the best maoves the Pokemon can get. Go out and find your local community and have fun!"

I also find myself not having a problem eating healthy because healthy food tastes good.  Simply going for fresh ingredients goes a long way to your food being healthy and it also goes a long way to making it taste better.  This does mean cooking at home more and limiting yourself to only eating at certain restaurants (some don't use fresh ingredients no matter how much they may claim to) but it is worthy it.  It does help that I am the kind of person that likes treating food as a form of art and cooking is a hobby for me."

"1. The shift London website is out of date; the links to the Cultural Heritage Screening Report PDFs no longer work.

2. Everything has pro's and cons; the project only lists the pro's the cons are not anywhere to be seen so it's impossible for someone to make an accurate decision

3. https://www.shiftlondon.ca/brt_features_and_benefits shows actually no real features or benefits. 
a. LTC currently runs a real-time bus monitoring service.
b. Improving Roads should be due-course for the city; they do not need a huge cash injection to do their job
c. The concept of Modern Stops is bad. No Bus stop in any other city as I am aware has ""technology"" stations; nor is it required for London Ontario (imho).
d. Smart Traffic Signals ... Again why do we need this? 
e. Making local bus service even better ... Sure. It's called fire the LTC Union. Why do they need to make $70k/yr. They are one of the highest paid, most protected workers in public service. They require a highschool degree and make more money than most of us. There's dozens of stories of bad LTC drivers who just hide behind their union.
f. The entire transition is expected to take 8 years; This is way too long. Dozens of businesses are likely to go out of business due to this. Look at the state of Dundas Street; Rexall, Blue Dubby, are only a few of the businesses that have left making that corner of the street a ghost town in terms of jobs.
g. Some buses currently run at the projected 5/10 minute window. See 13, 90, 2 bus routes. So this BS about there being more is stupid; LTC buys more buses; problem solved.

I could keep going on but the entire BRT plan website is littered with bullshit that came from a junior marketer. They have failed in my eyes to put forth any plan that they couldn't implement without the federal money. In fact if they don't improve the roads the City is negligent in their duties to provide citizens good working roads.

I get wanting to get free money from the government; but they are only willing to cover so much. The rest of us have to pay for the rest and I believe small incremental improvements can be made that are a fraction of the cost and will deliver more real value with less disruption to the traffic flow of the city."

There is still some indiscernible graphic before the A.

Since he's walking and carrying a water bottle, I'm assuming his place of employment is nearby (could not be--maybe he takes public transport and his home is nearby instead.) I tried looking up some business in the area, but I can't find a logo or business name that resembles it.

"That 25% number from Big Machine's wiki page is uncorroborated and appears to have been made by a user with a gibberish name and only one recorded edit; making changes to the Big Machine Records page. 

The only recorded statement I've come across is 3% according to Borchetta to [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-in-wonderland-180107/) in 2012:

&gt; They signed to a fledgling label called Big Machine Records, founded by a former Universal executive named Scott Borchetta. Swift‚Äôs dad...was a minor investor in the label, which was more of an idea than a company when they signed: ‚ÄúScott Swift owns three percent of Big Machine,‚Äù Borchetta says. ‚ÄúBut I hear people go, ‚ÄòOh, well, he funded the whole deal, and that‚Äôs why Taylor‚Äôs Number One.‚Äô It‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòPlease, people.‚Äô Everybody wants to say, ‚ÄòWell, there‚Äôs a reason.‚Äô Yeah, there is a reason. ‚ÄòCause she‚Äôs great. That‚Äôs the reason.‚Äù

[According to Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8472567/taylor-swift-big-machine-record-contract-ending-new-deal), as of 2015 Borchetta owns 60% of Big Machine. 

The thing that people seem to keep overlooking in favor of the 'Taylor's dad bought her career' narrative is that Toby Keith, at the height of his popularity and bucks, got his money in at the beginning and still has that ownership percentage. A percentage that's kept him in the Forbes top 10 earning country artists to this day."

&gt;&gt;&gt;  I am a woman who has been college aged and I have definitely slept with my guy friends in beds with them because I trust them because they're my god damn friends and yes, these are straight guys. I've woken up with one of their hands on my ass...and guess what? it didn't mean a thing. Maybe he wanted to fuck me but I had no interest in it and the boundaries were already clear, because we are friends.

&gt;&gt; So you teased a bunch of your male friends in college, and one of them sexually assaulted you? Nice. This is exactly why no college aged woman in her right mind sleeps in a bed with her male friends; she knows they would gladly have sex with her, and that dangling it in front of them is both taking needless risk, and mildly cruel (not saying he should have touched you). I appreciate your using this anecdotal experience to prove my point.

The requirement of such is moving economically to the left by giving the government more power to intervene in the economy.

"&gt;Is it a freshener that you place somewhere in the restroom and just fill it up each time you come in?

Yes. I also sold the service as a smell good near the front door of a business. ""The customer walks is, they smell, they smile! It's just good for business."" 

I would charge $5 every 2 weeks for this.

I did this in central Arkansas for 2 years as a serviceman. Then for 10 years in the Detroit Metro area on my own. Standalone for both.

As a weekly service, my investment was in the air freshener unit ($9 ea.) and the battery, the first cleaning of the fixture. This is an investment of time. The dirtier the fixture, the more amazing the transformation. After the first cleaning, a weekly cleaning takes 2 minutes or less. (So, $1 a minute) If you go for a monthly cleaning, your dirt build up will be substantial. $5 per fixture would keep your $1 per minute rate.

Also, bathrooms in the south were much dirtier than the bathroom in the north. In Arkansas, businesses needed this service. In Detroit are, it could be a hard sell.

Also, companies like Cintas have moved to include air fresheners as part of their services.

Last one, there is an industry secret on how to clean porcelain fixtures quickly. If you move forward with you plans, and don't already know, PM me and I'll tell you what it is."

"**Cryptosporidium**

Cryptosporidium is a genus of apicomplexan parasitic alveolates that can cause a respiratory and gastrointestinal illness (cryptosporidiosis) that primarily involves watery diarrhea (intestinal cryptosporidiosis) with or without a persistent cough (respiratory cryptosporidiosis) in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient humans.Treatment of gastrointestinal infection in humans involves fluid rehydration, electrolyte replacement, and management of any pain. As of  January 2015, nitazoxanide is the only drug approved for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent hosts.  Supplemental zinc may improve symptoms, particularly in recurrent or persistent infections or in others at risk for zinc deficiency.  Cryptosporidium oocysts are 4‚Äì6 ¬µm in diameter and exhibit partial acid-fast staining.

"... and most of the light will never catch up with us. 

Three hundred billion years from now a species not so different from us has just reached a point in its evolution and technology where they have begun to look out into the universe and to ponder on what is out there.

But it is all black beyond the faint light from their own red sun and the planets dancing around it. 

Nothing can be detected beyond it and they will conclude that their solar system and it's seven planets, of which their home is the second out, and a thin haze of minor rocks is all there is and ever was. It is alone in a seemingly infinite dark void that never changes. Never has and never will. 

It is beyond them to ever learn that it all started somewhere and that there are countless of billions of places just like theirs and that they also are alone in the infinite darkness that grows in size forcing everything within it apart from the next so fast that no traces of them can reach each other. It is beyond them to guess that once a very long long time ago an earlier species much like them were there to see it. 

See all the firework 

That had access to that which allowed them to trace back the origin and learn how it started and to realise that others coming into existence far enough into the future could never do that and that they could never tell them. "

"They are preventing me from running my own life. Read the replies I made to the other commenters in this comments section. Earlier this year, my narcissistic parents started acting erratic towards me when I told them that I was going to call Human Services. I am afraid that they might harm me if I was to leave their house. Also, my narcissistic mother said told me that she doesn't want me to live by myself. Because of those things I just told you, I am planning on having Human Services get me out of their house instead of leaving on my own. Another reason why I am planning on having Human Services get me out of their house instead of leaving on my own is because I live in an urban city. With that being said, it is not safe for me to leave on my own. The best way for me to leave is to have Human Services get me out of their house. Also, let me tell you that I only think my parents are narcissists because they sound like the type of parents that are talked about on the RBN subreddit. I do not know what disabilities my parents have. Since I don't know what disabilities my parents have, I don't know if they were diagnosed with narcissism. Even though I don't know if they were diagnosed with narcissism or not, I am still going to have the department of Human Services get me out of my parents house. My parents' behavior is not normal."

&gt;Okay this is the important point. Ethical breeders do breed for health and longevity. That's pretty much the main thing they breed for.

You can get a purebred who you can be sure isn't inbred...That's the point of an ethical breeder...It's just expensive. My dog's parents are from two different countries in Europe and we have extensive genealogy on him, ensuring he's not inbred.

My point wasn't about this breed or any breed in specific. It was about breeding as a whole. We need to breed new breeds. We don't need to breed for dogs to hunt burrowing animals and shit like we do with dachshunds. We need dogs to be bred for different things in general.

"I used to be really ashamed of it. I live right in the boundary between the ""Great Lakes"" accent and the beginnings of the Upper Midwest (that everyone thinks is Minnesota) accent and also fairly close to where the Midlands accent is common, and where at least one of my ancestors migrated north from. My family's accent has features that are non-prestigious from two of those three accents (the Midlands' enpenthetic r and the Yooper/Minnesota vowel shifts) in a community where those features were not common. At a young age I trained myself to sound more like people on TV so I wouldn't be made fun of as viciously as some of my relatives were.

As an adult I enjoy the freedom to slide between the ""news"" accent and the three component accents near me, and to mirror the people around me, but I find the older I get the more delighted I am that the voice I talk to myself and my family in is slipping more toward the bizarre Midlands/Upper Midwest mix my family speaks in, that I spoke in as a child. There's not a lot I got from my family I'm proud of, but that's literally the only thing not wrong with my family and the only thing we were mistreated by our community over. So fuck da haters. Yes, Da haters. And pronounce the T in haters a little more like a d than you think you should without pronouncing it like Hader. 

But I can never go back to the enpenthetic r. I'm sorry. I just can't. There's nothing wrong with it and people who do it should be encouraged, but I've searched wikipedia for ""warsh"" and I can't go back. 

Thanks, though."

"This is awesome. I've been hoping someone would post something like this. Some questions for you, since I'm continuing doing a much more DIY version of this.

1. What year/version/spec MacBook Pro's are you using?
2. Are you triggering the Helix changes manually or are they programmed?
3. What are your thoughts on using an Apogee Jam + or an Apogee Duet as an interface?
4. How many tracks on average are you running per song?
5. Any problems? (Crashes, CPU overload, bugs, etc.)

I've used MainStage in past live performances with an Axiom 61 and a Maschine with the Helix triggered manually, but I'm in the process of switching over to Ableton Live in combination with Push 2, Maschine MK3, and Komplete Kontrol S61, and then Helix Native or S-Gear with programmed patch changes running. I've been running a MacBook 12"" 2017 1.4 GHz (2.5 boost) Kaby Lake (i7) with 16GB RAM and haven't had much trouble unless I'm trying to run Razor or something. Hoping it will work with Ableton as having a compact setup with quick teardown is a must for me."

"&gt;Examples of slut-shaming include being criticized or punished...

&gt;Her actions were due to my casual and promiscuous sex.

Gonna stop you right there, dude. Her feeling uncomfortable having sex with you, and therefore electing not to have sex with you, is neither a punishment nor a criticism, it's her making a choice *about her own body*.

No decision a person makes about their own body can be sex shaming you, full stop.

The fact that *you feel shame* doesn't mean that anyone is sex shaming you. The fact that someone not having sex with you makes you feel shame is an indicator that the relationship is not healthy, but it doesn't mean they are shaming you.

&gt;I told her I‚Äôm not going to tell you who to have sex with but we were friends with the girl as well and I asked her if she had thought about her before hand since it seemed they were monogamous. That to me I felt like it was sex shaming her

Uhhh, no. Criticizing someone for participating in *unethical* non-monogamy is in no way sex shaming.

&gt;If I told her I no longer feel comfortable with you anymore due to your actions and only comfortable mutually masturbating, that‚Äôs sex shaming to me.

That's not sex shaming. There is no situation where ""I feel uncomfortable having sex with you because of X, so we're not going to have sex,"" is sex shaming. EVER.

&gt;If she just broke up with me that‚Äôs fine.

Then you should have broken up with her! This is another thing with enmeshment, you are expecting her to be responsible for your needs, instead of taking responsibility for your own needs. I really, *really* hope that you are in therapy."

"I see it this way: they absolutely would be getting higher numbers by cutting the block, pushing it later, and having 3 hours of FOX lead ins. It depends on how the network wants to allocate it's expenses and resources. We've seen that they are limited in the number of FOX shows they can air a week. Using that to program Saturday may not be as beneficial because then they sacrifice an airing on another more important night. So what those shows may bring in may not be worth that. If Toonami, a relatively cheaper resource is bringing in what they want (as low as these numbers are) without using a more valuable resource than that's their call to make since only they know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm surprised that they've let this go on for 4 weeks without making any changes. They are known for their reactionary scheduling. They've recently yanked the 9pm Home Movies from Sunday and also a Saturday Venture Bros after only one week of poor performance. For whatever reason, at this time, they feel like this is their best option for Saturday.  Now that can change as we saw in early 2015. If they all of a sudden get panicky then they probably will bring out the big guns for Saturday to elevate ratings. We currently have a 7 hour block with 4.5 hours of premieres. I think a big part of why they expanded was so they can get these long runners AND still have room for rotating premieres. We got earlier because they also don't want these shows premiering later than 2:00 AM. So this is kind of where we are at for now. In 2015/16 we had the numbers pre Toonami pumped up really high due to the FOX lineup which was not only before the block, but after. What we are seeing now is what the block is capable of without all of that lift. Hopefully thats enough for them"

* Once prohibition had ended, President Roosevelt said ""What America needs now is a drink"".

* Once prohibition started, vineyards would start selling ""grape bricks"" of concentrated juice - they had very detailed warning labels telling you **NOT** to let the brick sit in water in a cool, dark place for 21 days, or it might *accidentally* ferment into wine!

A bow shot from a *non*-specialized archer will hit often: A melee fighter should still have have strength-appropriate bow; with +11 BAB, Dex 14, and just a +1 bow, the fighter attacks with +14/9/4, therefore hitting on 7, 12, or 17 (an 82% chance of hitting at least once) and dealing around 1d8+6 damage. 

That's not a lot of damage, but the point is that *hurting a CR 9 monster* should rarely be difficult for an 11th level party. You can also consider Pembroke. I don't know why he fireballed when he could've just magic missiled, which guarantees 5d4+5 damage, an average of 17.5 damage with no miss change or save. Compare that to Fireball, which averages 21 damage, but that's *pre-save* and is therefore no better than a magic missile against a single target. 

Barron's misses *more* than a dedicated archer because he can misfire, and misfiring also costs him actions - he either clears as a standard or spends grit to use a move action. Either way, he's losing three or four attacks when that happens!

Finally, Barron can be neutralized much more easily than an archer because he has to be so close. It's not Grant's fault that Troy doesn't have his giants use a Sundering Charge to destroy his weapon at the start of every fight - sunder can be used in place of an attack (not a standard action as they thought), and therefore can be combined with a charge. A frost giant has speed 40, so there's basically nothing Barron can do avoid getting every giant he can shoot to just charge at his gun. Heck, even if Four Bears is standing in the way, they can overrun him then attack Barron the next round.

"Cutting calories helps you lose weight; exercising helps ensure your weight loss is focused on fat while preserving muscle mass and bone health. The cardio aspect of exercise helps keep your heart and lungs healthy and will get you lower blood pressure and a lower resting heartrate; strength training helps increase your muscle mass / bodyfat and increases the number of calories you burn. A combination of reduced caloric intake and/or more nutritionally balanced diet + regular cardiovascular and strength training is the tried and true path toward losing fat, looking better, feeling better, and living longer. Any of those things on their own is a good thing, to be sure.

Trade 3 is also doable. I probably prefer this one because you've got the ceiling play with CMC. It also comes down to preference too as you can think that the gap between Michel, Chubb, and CMC isn't that great, but I'd be hesitant to say that after one game of Chubb and Michel's injury.

"Be careful about taking people with you. Check your contract to see if you have a Non-Compete agreement. These usually have something in there about not taking other employees when you leave. They say other stuff too, but those items are harder to enforce, usually.

If you want people to come with you, tell them where you are going and let them contact your new company and kind of lead them on that they should call them up, just to be safe.  All this is if you have something in your contract saying you cant take people with you. If you dont have anything that says that, round up your work buddies and GTFO!

 Also, dont tell your current employer where you are going next. You are not required to and it sounds like they're dicks, so it's probably best if they dont know where you (or your coworkers) are going. "

"Being non-white doesn't make you any less susceptible to lies and propaganda.  Trump said he's smart and doing great, and despite there being no actual evidence of Trump being good at anything other than lying and riling up idiots, they believe him.  True, most non-whites are put off by his race hate baiting.  But some of them are happy to turn a blind eye to it.  It's like how Pence is gay, but is publicly anti-gay.  Tribalism does weird stuff to people sometimes, where if someone wants to belong to a tribe that conflicts with the tribe they're born into, they end up actually hating their own race/sexual orientation/gender.  A vocal minority within PC culture takes it too far with the SJW stuff, and a natural response to that is to go the opposite direction, and join the half of the country trying to gaslight the rest of the country into believing that misogyny, racism and bigotry don't exist or aren't a problem.  Anybody can get caught up in that, regardless of race or sex."

"&gt;Turns out an entire week equals 6 hours? Yea, I'd be pissed to lol. this was straight up marketing failure on the part of Bethesda

I am not even remotely excited for 76 but this is incredibly scummy, yes. It's literally false advertisement, not just marketing failure. Aside having people pre-order the game in order to *maybe* get access to the beta (which is also terrible), they never disclosed that it will be a very limited experience. And yes, gaining access to the beta didn't cost anything extra past the 60 dollars base price, but money spent early is still money spent early. Some people maybe had other things they wanted to buy at the time that would've been immediatly rewarding, but instead they chose to spend their money on pre-orderding Fallout because they figured they could play the actual game a week earlier and that it'd be worth it. 

Also, the hours chosen are pretty much the worst for european players, unless you want to stay up in the middle of the night to play the game. And like even in the US people could be at work or school. It really grinds my gears with how scummy they have been and I am quite dissapointed in Bethesda indeed. "

"Is he?  The only instance I've gotten of that is his ""I've got a score to settle"" line.  Overall, he's definitely got a different persona in 5.

In 4, past Berial giving him that slight bit of information, Nero's rather straight faced.  He'll smirk, and say something stylish, but he's not very overt with his actions or flashy.  He's got a job and he wants it done.

The reveal trailer for 5 is the exact opposite, wherein he's actively indulging in extremes (liking fighting as the van spins) with a smile and the other trailers further this.  He's more playful, and seems a bit less aggressive.

Not that I'm complaining.  It shows a clear growth in his character (I'd probably be more upset if he didn't have any changes in 5).  I just miss his presentation in 4; his attempts to be ""cool"" and overall stoicism that clashed with that.  He seems more defined and straight shooting in 5 (so far)."

"All phys reduction estimates are based on armour alone.  No endurance charges, no flask reductions, and no flat/% phys reduction from gear.  But 20% estimated from armour for the slayer vs. maybe 11% at most on the assassin.

Adds shouldn't have been an issue either since lions roar kept them out of range for the slayer, and the assassin would have been just as prone to getting double tapped by adds+minotaur."

I have a bubble in one tire I can't afford to replace. My windshield wipers don't work, and it rains her a TON. This is all AFTER spending over a thousand dollars trying to replace the breaks and gas lines. I still have to drive this car over 60+ miles for work everyday, and I just pray it doesn't break down.

Right now you're dating someone who isn't making very loving and rather than worrying whether or not loves you as much as his ex you could be looking for someone who thinks you're great just for yourself.

Again an issue of nationality rather than whiteness. I would look up the history of ""whiteness"" and Italians in America.

"Stunning Ms Marvel removes all passive ability, no assists for anybody, no taunt, no anything.  That makes brawler teams a one swap (if you need that depending on your team) auto win, as it is easily reduced to all squishy brawlers with no tanks.

MM with defenders I suspect is possibly great for Arena even though a downgrade everywhere else since you can't really focus punisher quite the same, but I don't really know since I run defenders + punisher myself, don't feel like same vs. same experience is enough to give opinion.  Plus, everyone swaps MM for punisher on defense... I don't feel like that would be optimal for defense either (because you need the punisher effect limiting roster choices, swapping with MM seems to be annoying but not necessarily optimal).  Seems like you'd be better off swapping JJ on defense for MM, just given her stupid use of ult first... definitely the one character the AI can most easily use wrong.  Nobody runs that though (I am guessing because nobody skips leveling her so everyone is always tinkering with the 5th slot only), so I am not sure if it is for good reason or not."

"Went to a somewhat disturbing lunch with various people from OSU today attended by a number of local alumni. It was generally good and I ended up meeting afterwards with someone from the engineering department who wants me to come to OSU periodically and do lectures on being a tech startup entrepreneur type and what engineers really need to know to succeed in the world. Sounds like a good chance to offend snowflakes. :-)

Anyway, the disturbing part was when the conversation went to football. Everyone - people from the alumni association, alumni, people from the actual departments/schools, staff - are all really shockingly cynical about Urban specifically and the program in general. It's even worse than the message boards. People seem genuinely sick of the coaching staff. When someone pointed out the fantastic record, I theorized that it's not the one loss, it's that we're all smart enough to see we have good players being badly, badly mismanaged by the coaches. I offered the comment that, to me, the programs reeks of apathy and laziness and everyone agreed. A few points brought up:

\- Urb ignores requests for help or appearances from all the charitable organizations in Columbus. 

\- Worse, one of the people worked directly with Archie Griffin on one of the big charities OSU does. When asked if Urb would be willing to speak, Archie told them they might as well just call Urb's assistant because he had no in or real contact with Urb at all. Yeah, that Archie Griffin. 

\- There were Martell family members at this (Aunt/Uncle I think). They said Tate's about ready to leave. Urb made personal promises to play him in certain situations this year, and installed packages to do so. Day and Wilson followed through with that when Day coached, but Urb chucked it once he came back. If he keeps mismanaging things this way we may find ourselves with 0 QBs next year.  I have mixed feelings about this that I kept to myself. 

\- Lots of people associated with OSU expect Urb to retire after this year. I don't think anyone knows anything for certain, just the impression people have.

Take this all with a grain of salt - just people talking. But there were definitely some first-hand remarks there. "

Even some good 

**VI** - Also favoritism. Getting something like Edgar USB, either of Locke's USBs, or Sabin USB could definitely help my neo-Torment team. Also, I've whiffed on Terra Arcane so many times that I feel obligated to at least try here.

**V** - Lots of great prizes here. Galuf chain is the grand prize that could help me with 5* magicite, especially since I have no earth chain yet. Would also be happy with either of Bartz ultras, Bartz Arcane, Dorgann USB, or other things.

**II** - Another chance at Maria Arcane/LMR, along with Minwu's stuff, Emperor's +earth rods, or even Firion's new toys (which are at least good stat sticks for me if anything). I can't afford to pull on the upcoming event, so this will help tide me over.

**III** - Not sure if this is the best idea for me, as I have a high amount of dupes, but the chance at Ingus chain (have his BSB2) or OK mUSB/USB3 (have basically everything else) is too tempting, especially since the III event doesn't look too desirable for me."

In my (anecdotal and non-quantified) experience, Norway takes a fair number of PhD students from abroad, US included. It's beneficial to have international representation. Actually, in my research group, only 2 of 8 are Norwegian. I'd say if you're a strong applicant you have as good a chance as any.

I will say that PhD students in Norway live very well compared to those in other countries. They get paid very well (much, much more than in the UK or US) and are considered proper staff so get all the associated benefits. The academic working culture here is also significantly more ""healthy"", in my opinion.

For your second point, I can't really help as I think this will be something that differs between fields. I know that in the sciences having a Norwegian PhD would certainly not be a drawback. It is all about what research you have done and what you've published.

Now the leaders of the movement that spawned this madness are calling for civility....!?!?!

Fuck that, and fuck them.

They don't really have a chance for redemption; the mess they have caused is too vast. 

However, they can still do what is right. They can speak directly to their most extreme followers urging for calm. They can apologize for the role they played to get this point.

"I agree. One should take responsibility and agency for their own life. I used to believe more in line with the idea that I didn't get the girl because Gods plan. And I wouldn't say I no longer believe God has a plan but I've come to realise that God doesn't give free handouts in everything in life, just because you asked. That's not how he works. That's how Santa works. God is much more complex than Santa. Imagine an ant trying to understand the thoughts and intentions of a human. But back to the original point. I agree. People often use God as a justification to not do anything or to explain away everything didn't go as they'd hoped. There's still a lot of theological debate about whether God controlls everything or if we have free will. I don't think we'll ever settle that argument so I won't get into it but I believe that regardless of your answer, it's still your responsibility to live your life. I agree that it's a good thing for a person to take agency into their own hands. However this doesn't break my belief in God. And I share your frustration with people who toss everything to the wind. I may be a Christian but I am still critical of Christianity. I think that's ok. No one's perfect. Definitely not Christians.

As for your other points.

Bible is what it is. This is a complex issue. I believe it's the best we have for what it does and I have faith that its enough for what it is. Admittedly this does require me to trust God. But I think the more important thing is your personal relationship with God.

Yes. I do believe God will forgive anyone who genuinely repents. It may seem unfair but I am glad that I don't have to be x good to pass because I don't know that I'd be able to be x good. And if the bible is to be believed, x is a pretty high standard. Also I believe there's a huge difference between being sorry and genuinely repenting and seeking a relationship with God that calls you to stop doing horrible things (if you're hitler for example).

I know many ministers and to my knowledge none of them are paedophiles. I've received working with children training several times in different cases before I was allowed to work in certain areas of the church. For the most part, in the churches I've been involved with, I believe they're working really hard to combat this real problem.
And it is a real problem that there are predators out there who put themselves in positions of power over children but this is very quickly get complex and off topic.

Also I'm sure there are churches out there who take advantage of people for money. Televangelism for example. You have no idea how frustrating I find this, but you're right, it's out there. However I don't think that this is God. This is humans. And humans can be really exceptional at corrupting good things.

Blood and body. I don't believe it's a physical blood. More Just a symbolic metaphor. It may seem strange, but I believe its not as strange if you look at it in the culture it came out off. Lots of theological debate about this one too. At the end of the day it's not a life or death issue.

I'm sure you have more and we could do this forever. And I doubt that my answers will change your mind or that your objections will change mine. This is a journey we all have to take personally with an open mind, in order to find what we believe is the truth. Id really like to encourage you however to think about it with an open mind. And it's OK if you don't like elements of Christianity. There's a lot I don't like too. But my advice world be to look for God. Not Christians. If you don't like Catholicism, look into prodestantism. We're trying to work it all out too. That's why there are so many branches of Christianity. But it sounds to me like you have reservations about irrational religion and bad things people do. I'm with you on that. But I still believe in God. There's a lot of rational Christians out there. I'm afraid however they aren't quite as loud in the internet. "

"From my understanding and research/education in public health and substance use disorders,  the reason alcohol and cannabis is restricted to 21+ isn't about handling it, it's more of a developmental issue. They're restricted to 21+ because brains and livers have almost reached maturity at that point so it's a health issue not a maturity issue. Considering many adults can't handle substances either when set free.


I do agree with you that teenagers and adults shouldn't be held to the same standards, definitely agree with this 100%. But teenagers need to be held responsible. They do stupid things, it's part of adolescence and we all know that, but a slap on the wrist isn't enough. They need to be educated. I feel as though nobody really addresses consequences with teenagers. They cry for freedom/being treated like an adult but they aren't and they can't act accordingly and need to be taught how to. Besides, *most* teenagers don't actively seek to defy authority because they want to, it's more because they can't make the right choices since nobody actually enforces smart decision making... but that gets messy unless they have involved parents and educators. 

Need more authoritative parenting and less permissive, authoritarian and rejecting-neglecting parenting styles lol

"My real legit light that I got direct from Streamlight does not have www.streamlight.com on it. Could be that Streamlight is changing what years have what logos to help prevent counterfit. Your legit ones look to be from 2015, the fake from 2017. My legit one is from 2017 though.

The batteries have the stamp, batteries have the spacer, the gasket is not flimsy, the number of ""heat fin rings"" is the same 2 rings that blend into the housing for the third.

Only thing I didnt check was the white spacer

I received a fake on one ebay which I quickly returned for a refund. But I was able to compare my real one to a fake like you and my fake was alarmingly accurate. It fooled me at first until I saw a thread on reddit that prompted me to investigate further. I did not check the batteries for the stamp, or the ""heat fin rings"". Everything, even the packaging appeared legit, but someone posted up buying two lights with the same serial number, that just happened to be my serial number as well.

I contacted streamlight like you did and they confirmed mine was a fake as well.

 You counter with the excuse of ""the missions on your map are available based on your SSD progression"" but not every player just starting will know that because ***the game doesn't explicitly state it***. So far as some players are concerned they're only unlocking new missions because they're doing the main story missions(which surprise surprise include the SSD's) and think that that's what the correspondence is but go ahead and keep telling me you ""know"" what every new player is thinking. Either way I'm done, there's no use trying to get blood from a rock. You obviously are set on gatekeeping/elitism for a game(Evidenced by ""However, if a player doesn't take the time to learn more about the game they are playing, I do not see them having as much fun overall as someone who knows the intricacies of the game.""

"As a young almost 23 male that had a lot of casual sex (with some men too), here are my thoughts:

1- gave me a bunch of different experiencies. Different body types, different ways to make people reach orgasm and realized that we dont have a formula to do it, kinky stuff, regular stuff, men experience (which o didn‚Äôt thought would have happened ever), several different worlds. 

2- Although this was exciting, most of my cases were one night stands or at max 3 nights together. This leads to most of the sex not reaching it‚Äôs maximum potential most of the times, since you don‚Äôt know the person that well, but also sometimes the sex was amazing because random new things happened.

3 - you can be really intimate physically and have a great night and not replicate that in a daily basis (aka don‚Äôt engage in a relationship), but most of the times things got tricky on this thin line of being just casual or people going out together 

4 - Made me feel a lot better with my body and learn to love and embrace peoples bodies as they are! Because most of all sex was being comfortable and mentally enjoying it, so this led up to many chains being broken and left on the ground.

"'Can we discuss how horrible the GM department is when it comes to ~~'Grief Tactics'~~ everything?'

I have played this game and have had an active subscription consistently since 2.0 early access. If there's one thing I have learned, that everyone should be aware of, is that the GM team has a complete lack of power to do anything to help the players, with anything serious actually happening (i.e. losing all your levels in Eureka upon leaving the zone when it first came out) requiring the devs to step in to both give them the green-light to lift a finger and any tools necessary to rectify it. Besides the only method of contacting them being unnecessarily obfuscated, they have no consistent time-frame in which they respond (anywhere from less than an hour to several days from latest correspondence in my experience), and when they do they are unnecessarily formal to the point of coming off as completely robotic and inhuman. The entire purpose of the GM team is to exist as a bare-necessity enforcement tool for SE to cover their asses, with the only absolute power they do have being total authority over enforcement of rules and any 'punishment' thereof. They have total control over how they handle any issues related to this that varies from GM to GM (Mordian Gaol, direct tells, or just going straight to the point of placing an action on the account with no attempt at contact, and copypaste 'we cannot discuss this, it has been reviewed, all decisions are final, we are infallible' if you try to contact them after the fact). You can see this in how they've operated over the years:

 - Unequal and varied rule enforcement depending on who you get, i.e. that one guy who posted on the subreddit a while back about how he had a name for years and had interacted with multiple GM's before but suddenly had a GM that required he completely change his name.

 - Allowing certain people to hack their spell/skill speed over an extended period of them, i.e. the BLM that shall not be named who used said hack in both Gordias Savage and PvP, even after he received (a comparatively small) account action and warned directly by the devs.

 - The absolute fucking mess that was the Ungarmax exploit, with at least two reports being ignored for months, until it finally gained the direct attention of the devs through reddit/official forums/social media, with people that used it multiple times on estate target dummies getting similar punishment to someone who used it once in an endgame fight. This one really rubs me the wrong way because one of the people who reported this exploit initially, after the GM's came back to him and said it didn't appear to be an issue, got one of the most severe account actions because he used it once or twice wiping in endgame prog as a goof. This entire fiasco was because the GM team investigated it purely as a 'is this a 3rd-party tool' issue instead of an exploit, like, you know, how it was reported.

Really the only thing the GM team cares about is if you use vulgar language. Mainly you can get away with it if you use it offhand without directing it towards anyone, maliciously or otherwise, but even then you can get boned if you get a bad GM on a bad day. You're not even safe if someone is persistently being a total asshole to you verbally in-game and you tell them to go fuck off (I have seen this happen personally). This in and of itself is absolutely retarded because this is a game that prides itself on its language and localization, with terms like 'Thal's bloody balls,' 'neuker,' and Garlean occupiers talking about whores 'doing things with her mouth that you wouldn't believe.'

As an aside, as much as I want to, the blame can't solely be placed on the GM team. The devs are absolutely culpable too, as evidenced by some of what I said above. They set the parameters by which the GM team operates. They're the ones that can, and should, change it."

"I‚Äôll answer your serious question with a serious answer (I‚Äôll check out the links as well. I really like that Atkins/Tobi song, though):

I‚Äôve actually been thinking about this recently: ""Why don‚Äôt I go and check out some of these acclaimed bands that have harsh vocals?"" I actually listened to Apex and enjoyed it (I found the black metal guy‚Äôs vocals humorous, so that helped. Weird, because I‚Äôve never felt that way before or since about black metal vocals). 

Metal has been more or less a part of my life since I was a little kid. It was mostly Nu/Alt Metal from WWE games and Guitar Hero. I actually enjoyed ""This Fire Burns"" from Killswitch Engage back in the day. Aside from that, my first exposures to like harsh vocals were ""Down From The Sky""- Trivium and ""This Love"" and ""Walk"" from Pantera. Something about the style didn‚Äôt jive with me. Keep in mind that I also listen and listened to a variety of other music including but not limited to: Pop, Country, Rap, Classic Rock, Grunge, any ""70s/80s/90s"" music, etc. and not just Metal. And my brain was always very vocal-centered when listening to music. Like the vocalist was the first thing I noticed, though good instrument playing and catchy instrument stuff did not go unnoticed.

So when I discovered Power Metal a few years ago, I was like ""Whoa! This is just what I wanted out of Metal for so long! It‚Äôs epic sounding, got cool melodies,  the singers are super good, and some of it‚Äôs even got Symphonic stuff in it (because Symphonic Music is super applicable to epic situations)"". Eventually for curiosity‚Äôs sake, I Youtubed some bands with harsh vocals to see what the band sounded like. Again, still didn‚Äôt jive with me. And that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at right now. I know what Death Metal and Grindcore and Deathcore and Black Metal kinda sound like from articles and minute long bursts on Youtube. This brings me back to the beginning. I‚Äôve been thinking about why exactly I‚Äôve been so aversive to this style. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm thinking it is. It‚Äôs a rather blunt answer and it‚Äôs gonna come off way harsher than intended, but I really can‚Äôt figure out how to phrase it better.  I‚Äôve never been into metal for the brutality and ""ugliness"", but for the melodic potential and ""prettiness"" that can be achieved with harder music. I guess I always saw Death Growls, Black Metal and Metalcore vocals as an extension of the brutality of Extreme Metal.

However, I‚Äôm anything but closed minded. Again, I‚Äôll check out those links and see what I think. I‚Äôve also got nothing against Extreme Metal or harsh vocals, they were just ""never my thing"". I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre inferior and my preferences are superior or anything elitist like that. Just two different big-tent ways of singing. Thanks for the response and the question."

"""what is an extreme is thinking your geographical location matters in the grand scheme of things""

other than the fact that we are all human I'd say geography DOES matter, for instance in this region of the world we speak English.. 

in that region they speak Arabic and tend to be majority Muslim ..

There ARE differences , does that mean that the people who live over there are inherently bad ? No because one could ask the exact same question about us ..

but we do believe and think in different ways and there's no shame in stating it .. Americans and Saudis probably wouldn't get along on a close personal level 

We should be honest with ourselves, we ALL believe that OUR countries social mores should be some sort of world standard 

( the same way that every person who loves their country thinks theirs is the best no matter what that country is )

It's just when it comes to countries as vastly  foreign as Saudi Arabia I'm not rushing to whitewash the differences so we can all sing Kumbaya together because there are aspects of their culture that I vehemently disagree with and have no desire to see Incorporated in American society. "

"Well, it'd be nice for a start if you could tell the difference between someone who thinks WWII should have been won by Germany, and someone who just really hates other specific issues. Or who wants to implement communism and someone who just wants some healthcare and education. Because in this debate both sides tend to just apply the worst version to their opponent and then say hope is lost because of these idiots.

Because in the end, I'd just personally support whichever party looks the least likely to drop free speech, and the right to hold any opinion. And if one party then chooses to come up with things like hate speech I'd never support them, unless they approached it in a civil manner at which is nowhere to be found in the current political landscape.

If you want to reconcile you need to win people's trust, there are plenty of people who're unwilling to move because they're core voters and it's their core life belief, there are also plenty of people who'd happily choose another side,  if the crazies on that side can be kept under control.

So far what I hear from the right outside of the crazy people is that they condemn people who commit terrorism, what I hear from the left is they support the notion of hate speech. A concept in which the current way it's being represented, I'm quite willing to see the world fall into literal flames before agreeing to."

"New Age topics really freak me the eff out. I got into more new age / spiritual stuff while healing from some health issues and it helped for a while. And then it ramped up my OCD ten fold. Things like astrology, tarot, law of attraction, energy healing, etc. I saw some energy healers and started to get super freaked out - like they were some omniscient authority on my life because they'd make these vague comments like they knew what was best for me, what had happened to me, what will happen for me. It started to feel like they had some power or control. 

All of this stuff started to make me feel like I both had no power and all the power (if I think a certain way I'll bring good into my life - except, it's really hard to think a certain way so I must be bringing bad in when I have bad thoughts). Anyways, I had to break all ties and associations but occasionally I'll see a tarot card on my Instagram explore page that says some cryptic bullshit like ""SUDDEN ENDINGS"" and think it's meant for me, or I'll catch the clock at 11:11 and question whether it's a ""sign"" that that intrusive thought I had in that exact moment must be true because I happened to catch the clock then.

"Honestly, the Planetside story pretty much results entirely from the unusual decision to build the story universe and lore around the game mechanics. Whereas other games would say, ""your character is not *literally* being resurrected when you respawn,"" Planetside says, ""no, there's a perfectly hand-wavy reason why that's actually happening."" There's not actually much narrative logic to any of it, if you stop to think about it. I guess it's possible the writers of the lore took inspiration from sci-fi with related premises, but I guarantee you that if they went a different direction with the game design and say, made it a 2-faction conflict or introduced perma-death, then the story simply would have been changed to fit."

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

You're so welcome. Good plan. I mean holy batshit. 
"&gt;	By shining city, do you mean Myr Tariniel itself?? Are you suggesting that Faeriniel and Myr Tariniel are the same place??

Yes, but separated in time. A city grew up there. 

Faeriniel -&gt; Tariniel -&gt; Myr Tariniel. 

I will reserve one caveat. The Edema Ruh are the descendants of the royal family of ergen. The One family or First family. It is possible that the city itself was more figurative than literal. The Tahl are also descendants of Myr Tariniel, and they are a nomadic people. I'm curious to see if Pat has any metaphors or imagery of a tent city...the ruh wagons were located at the center of Faeriniel. 

&gt;	It seems to me that there are key locations in Jax's story. And also that the distinctions between all roads leading to or passing through are mui mui importanto. Although I can't for the life of me figure out what the differences mean at the moment

Yes it is confusing. You have to hold onto a cognitive dissonance to understand it. Tht is, you must hold two contradictory beliefs in your head at once. You know, as a reader your must split your mind.

There are multiple states, all related to the road. Pat is deliciously ambiguous with what it means to have a broken road, a broken house, a folding house.

The Great Stone road is a perfectly straight line. Assuming Temerant is not a flat earth, the road follows a [Great Circle](https://gisgeography.com/great-circle-geodesic-line-shortest-flight-path/) geodesIc. Its a straight line mapped to a sphere. 

Incidentally: This is why Jax's folding house didn't fit together quite right and why nothing was square. His folding house is a map that jax used **as a link** to the four corners (Jax's box). The map, his link is a projection of a sphere mapped onto cartesian coordinates and this causes distortion.

Anyway, The beginning of the road is at the university in Belene, the end of the road is at the Lackless door or the Door of Death (another name for it) in Tahl, where Myr Tariniel once stood. 

But the two doors are connected through shaping magic so they are magically also two sides of the same door. This turns the perfectly straight line of a great circle road into an actual circle because the ends of the road meet. Are you with me so far? Cognitive dissonance: the road is **both** a straight line and a circle.

Jax traveled the world chasing the moon. The moon orbits in a circle. Therefore jax followed a circle when he followed the road chasing the moon. 

It's also a broken road and a broken circle because the (lockless) doors of stone were closed and locked.

Again compound cognitive dissonance: 

-	the lockless doors are locked and lockless.
-	The straight road is also a circle 
-	the circle is a closed but its a straight line too so its actually not a closed circle.
-	it begins in Belene and ends in Myr Tariniel but its a circle so it actually has no beginning and no end.

Now to bake your noodle. I hope you like zen riddles!

Kvothe opened the four plate door. He united mortal and fae, he restored the broken circle, the greystone road is once again in the shape of a ring. 

The Waystone Inn sits on this very same road now. Again, both literally and figuratively.

&gt;It was not a large road, or well traveled. It didn't seem to lead anywhere, as some roads do.

**Question**: What kind of road doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Or more specifically, what kind of road leads to Newarre (nowhere)?

**Answer**: A circle. It leads back to where it started. A circle is thus also a broken road. Broken because it doesn't lead anywhere.

&gt;	""He issued a proclamation saying any of the ***traveling rabble* on the roads** were subject to fine, imprisonment, or transportation without a trial. The term became shortened to '**ravel**' through metaplasmic enclitization."" 

The end of the waystone road has another name. 

&gt;	He raised an eyebrow at that. ""Did it now?"" I nodded, ""Though I suspect there is a connection to **'ravel-end'**, referring to the ragged appearance of traveling performing troupes that are out at the heels.

Ravel-end. Ravel is a awesome word. It's its own antonym, it means to tangle and to entwine and also to pull apart or untangle. 

Cognitive dissonance. The ends of the road are both joined and separate.    

&gt;	Jax - Tinue, which he continues past. He then comes to the hermit in the cave, 

The hermit in the cave in the mountains is Teccam. The cave is the joined Lackless door/four plate door. Jax encounters Teccam teaching barefoot from his cave in the mountains at the university. He is in both places at once. 

&gt;which=Selitos and Myr Tariniel, where he gets the ""no, don't unfold that here"". 

Jax unfolded the house here. He **unlinked** the doors. Or he locked the lockless door or broke the circle.

&gt;Jax took hold of the piece of crooked wood and tried to straighten it. Suddenly he was holding two pieces of wood that resembled the beginning of a doorframe

Two pieces of wood, two doors, that resemble the beginning....the beginning of a door frame. It is located here: at the old man's cave.

&gt;‚ÄúDon‚Äôt unfold it here!‚Äù the old man shouted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a house outside my cave, blocking my sunlight!‚Äù Jax tried to push the two pieces of wood, back together. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I fold it back up?‚Äù

This door is the Lackless door. It's the end of the road or the door of death. Its a black door with thick shadow underneath. (Jax put the cave in shadow when he unfolded the house)

&gt;Then Ben was no longer there, and there was not one standing stone but many. More than I had ever seen in one place before. They formed a **double circle** around me. One stone was set across the top of two others, forming a **huge arch with thick shadow underneath**. I reached out to touch it....
And awoke. 
-NotW kl. 2295

The huge arch is the cave.

&gt;""I've heard that on the oldest parts of the Lackless lands, in the oldest part of their ancestral estate, there's a secret door. A door without a handle or hinges."" He watched me to make sure I was paying attention. ""There's no way of opening it. It is locked, but at the same time, lockless. No one knows what's on the other side.""
-WMF p. 402

Death. No one knows what's on the other side of death. 

&gt;‚ÄúWhere does the road lead?‚Äù ‚ÄúDeath. All lives end in death, excepting one. Such is the way of things.‚Äù 

Lanre died at the black of drossen tor. The door of death. He died fighting a beast who's breath was a darkness that smothered men. The door of death. Lanre died fighting the enemy: death. But he beat death too and came back.

So are you ready for some more mind bending zen? The road is also metaphysical. It's the road of life.



### The Metaphorical Road
The road is a theme in the KKC.  It transcends the physical and crosses into the metaphysical as a thematic representation of the road of life. Like all good themes. It is both literal and figurative.

### The Lethani

&gt;	""It is the right way through the mountains. But the Lethani is also knowing the right way. Both. And mountains are not just mountains. Mountains are everything.""

The Lethani is a perfect example of the literal and figurative sense of this road. Sure Tempi is using a metaphor but; in antiquity the Greystone Road was longer and it passesd through the mountains to Myr Tariniel. 

&gt;	Shehyn hesitated slightly, then said, ""How do you follow the Lethani?""
&gt;	""How do you follow the moon?""

Jax spent his life chasing the moon on the broken road. He caught it at Myr Tariniel. 

### Tehlu's path

&gt;	Tehlu drew a line in the dirt of the road so that it lay between himself and all those who had come. ‚ÄúThis road is like the meandering course of a life. There are two paths to take, side by side. Each of you are already traveling that side. You must choose. Stay on your own path, or cross to mine.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut the road is the same, isn‚Äôt it? It still goes to the same place,‚Äù someone asked. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere does the road lead?‚Äù ‚ÄúDeath. All lives end in death, excepting one. Such is the way of things.‚Äù

The passage is both literal and metaphorical. The road is the road of life. All lives end in death, **excepting one**. 

There is one moon. The moon's name is **Lu**dis. Lu is the beginning of Luten, the first day of the week. Lu means 'One' or 'First' in Temic.

Lu is also the end of Teh**lu**'s name. Teh is Temic for lock. Jax chased the moon and caught her at the end of the road. He locked a piece of her name in an iron box. The iron box is the Lockless door. It's also the four plate door. 

The Iron box Is the Black drawstone door or black of drossen tor.


See /u/Kit-Carson 's  post on the [Lackless Door and Blac of Drossen Tor](https://reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/8utb4j/the_fourplate_door_and_the_most_dangerous_man_at/) from a few months back.  Kit gives a good argument that the word **Tor** in blac of Drossen Tor is a corruption of the word '**door**'. 

&gt;	There's evidence that ""Tor"" translates to ""gate"" or ""door"" (more on this theory and the Spanish translation below) but I agree that ""Lackless Door,"" and by extension ""black dress,"" is a relatively recent name that arose from a mistranslation. That said, I do believe there was an actual door linked to the Lackless ancestors of antiquity, and its historical significance has been almost completely lost over the centuries.
--/u/Kit-Carson 

Kit's conclusions are similar to  /u/aerojockey 's excellent analysis of the [poetic verse and meter](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/4zc5m4/lackless_poem_origins/) in the Lackless rhymes. I'll quote the relevant bit, but aeorjockey's post is well worth the read.

"nice, i too made the switch (Pixel 2XL &gt; iPhone XS, after being on Android since 2010). 

i agree with most of what you said, especially the good. what's good about this phone is GOOD. it's hilarious to me that most Google apps, in particular, are more functional in iOS than Android. Chrome is more ergonomic, Maps and Music work better and have more functionality, et cetera. Gestures on iOS are so natural to me too. i thought i'd hate them but they're so easy and intuitive. plus my whole family is on iMessage and that IS a new experience. i thought people were joking. iMessage really is a huge bonus.

just some minor gripes/things i thought i'd add!

1. Notifications on iOS are still lightyears behind Android. no always on display, notifications being unable to stack in a status bar, them haphazardly stacking on the front screen. it's just ugly. i don't understand how iOS can be so polished and yet so basic. 

2. specific to me, i require jumbo keyboards. i got clumsy thumbs. not being able to modify keyboard sizes is just so unfortunate. 

3. the home screen is just ugly. where's our app drawer? only 4 icons on the home bar?

honestly, i thought it'd be a jarring switch. but it's been incredibly seamless and it's kind of fun to use a new OS after so much time with Android. truth be told, i only ever used stock Google apps on my phones and didn't do any customization. so maybe that's why the switch was easy.

"I've got both. Choosing either means some trade-offs.

1. Horsepower: The T430 has an older generation CPU and GPU, although they're faster as they run at a 35W TDP and the GPU can take advantage of dual channel memory. You can upgrade the T430's CPU to a quad core i7 if you so desire. This will come at the expense of battery life.
2. Battery: The X240 will get phenomenal battery life off the bat. A 3 cell internal plus 6 cell external battery on a system with a 15W TDP CPU will go just about all day. You'd need a protruding 9 cell to get that kind of battery life on the T430. Added bonus is the X240 supports power bridge - you can swap external batteries while on the internal battery.
3. Storage/Expandability The T430 wins on expandability with its ultrabay. You can have 2x SATA HDD/SSD (or an optical drive) and 1x mSATA SSD. The X240 can take an M.2 SSD, but it needs to be SATA, and in the 2242 profile, which aren't too common. More USB ports on the T430 as well - 4 vs 2. Expresscard slot means you can add an eGPU for more graphics power too.
4. Display: I'd say the X240 has the advantage when it comes to the display. 768p on a 12 inch screen looks better than a 14 inch and IPS and FHD screens are available as swap-in components. IPS and/or FHD on a T430 requires additional hardware.
5. Portability: The X240 wins hands down. It's lighter and slimmer.
6. Networking: The X240 supports AC wifi. The T430 can only take an AC card with a custom BIOS, which can be a pain to flash.
7. Annoying things: The T430's fan is LOUD! Especially if you get a Toshiba fan and not a Delta fan. The clickpad on the X240 is irritating to tolerable, but can be swapped for an X250 touchpad. Some puritans will say get a T430 and swap to the classic keyboard, but the island one is pretty good on its own.   


End of the day: If you need the horsepower or versatility on the road, T430. If you need a lighter machine with better battery life, display, and wireless, X240."

"&gt;1.0 is a milestone by which we can close the bugs and let the community freely mod the game so we can focus on the next free updates and not be buried by thousands of bugs and instability both inside and outside. There is no pressure we can call it whatever we want.

You probably read most of the Devs answers like I did so you would know that they deny over and over the existence of any other reason or pressure beside their internal decision (Dev team) of calling 1.0 to that build.

They claim that the decision is associated with the need to establish a new and fresh starting point for the game and for them. Considering the chaos and the atypical that Dayz's development has been all these years (two branches with different techs, little bugs that breaks everything, broken deadlines, bad reputation, a community at times extremely toxic..) I can fully understand and respect that as a valid decision. They are fking people after all and if this game becomes frustrating for us that we just sit and play, this should be a fucking Goku kick in the balls for them every day.

Although it is very likely that you are right in your thinking, I find it hard to believe that the devs deny this with such determination in the Status Reports, on Discord, in their participations on reddit, on twitter... I mean, Eugen even spoke about deprension because of this kind of decisions and the negativity from that. What can be worse than that? to be kicked out of BI? This is what happened to Hicks (who also denied it outright)? Fuck it, I would hit the door myself if i lived a situation where I would put my health behind the decisions of the ""company heads"".

Edit: Imagine if BI wants to charge some particular Dayz content in the future (I mean, they could definetly do it since the early access model is not there anymore after having reached 1.0). Should the devs just find a way to justify this by some elaborate excuse so they do not have any kind of problem with ""the boss""? I know it is an extreme and unprovable case, but it makes you think."

"Oh, magical things happen! But it depends on exactly where you are in relation to the wave and how deep the water is. Now, I'm not some wave scientist with all that fancy book learning, but I surf and I grew up acting the fool with my brothers in the shorebreak of Waimea. But basically, waves break by ""tripping"" over the sea floor, so you can have waves breaking in water that's deep enough to allow you to dive down and avoid a beatin', or, if the water is really deep until RIGHT at the shore line, you'll get those amazing waves that break onto ""dry"" sand. Those are fun, but there's really nowhere to hide. 

The POINT is, and this is key, ain't no water moving FORWARD in a wave that hasn't broken yet. You dig? It's only once the wave breaks that it will push water, and you, forward. So, if you can get to that sweet spot where the wave JUST breaks over your head *and* dive down deep enough to not get pulled along with the ass-end of all that wave action, you're fine. And you don't have to dive all that far. (Watch any YT video of surfers duck-diving.) 

BUT, my man, if you are forward of the ""impact zone"" and are at or near the surface of the water, a big enough wave will send you into ""the washing machine"", which is pretty much what it sounds like. You are tumbling underwater in a snow white wonderland of foam and fear, with no concept of up-down-left-right, and feeling like your arms and legs are going to be pulled off. (They never are.) And that's if you're lucky enough to be in deep water! If you're in shallow water, you'll be bouncing off the bottom, and you better hope it's sand and not rock or reef. If it's one of those waves that crashes right onto the beach, though? Man, that's actually pretty dangerous--but fun. Neck and back injuries ABOUND from folks getting slammed into the sand by a wave. 

In conclusion, I cannot fucking believe I just wrote this much about shorebreak. The End."

Title: **I bought a dog from a guy in my neighborhood and he wants it back to re-sell it.**

Original Post: 

&gt; So about two months ago, I bought a dog from a guy in my neighborhood because my family were ready to take care of one. I bought the dog from a guy that already has 2 other dogs, and he plans on selling them. After I bought the dog from him, he came over drunk sometimes (because we're family) and would tell us that he wanted his dog back. We already got the legal information of the dog and we own him, legally. We bought our own supplies for the dog and the previous owner wants him back because he wants to re-sell him. What do I do?

"Except the game is called ""**War**craft"". The whole idea is that there are two main factions, and they don't like each other.

The problem is now a human problem, which means the devs need an expert on human problems. This issue lies somewhere between psychology and political tribalism, in my mind, and is not something a group of software developers can solve.

We could, literally, be looking at the death of WoW. Not as we know it, but at the literal death of WoW. As in shuttering the game as a genre leader forever.

...and that's something I've honestly *never said before*.

The best I can come up with is free faction transfers if you transfer from horde to alliance as long as the population is imbalanced (or alliance to horde if it's bad the other way). Then provide a ""transfer back"" option that will reverse the switch as long as you pull the lever within a fair amount of time (like 3 weeks) so that apps can jump back if they fail to make the cut. Put it in the same menu as un-deleting characters.

This is all assuming they eliminate the horde's racial ability advantage and actually get off their asses and balance shit. The concentration of talent isn't really an issue as long as the bar to swap back isn't too unforgiving since the ability to faction swap is what got us into this mess in the first place."

"Definitely yes.

Coming from the opposite side of what you described (I played pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh then found Magic, Hearthstone, and similar others), you can definitely build decks to fit a certain playstyles - just a matter of finding the right cards to get what you want. When I played Yu-Gi-Oh I ran a Dark World deck that I worked on that was considered an aggro style deck. A friend who I played with and lost regularly too ran a mill deck, in a definite slow and control type of way. I feel a lot of the big tcg games have enough card variety to allow for the different strategies people would expect.

Regarding other games that are considered more ""board game"", some are deep enough to allow this and others aren't. Some that I have experience in that I believe support the ""more than one way to win"" are

* Hero Realms
* DC Deck Building
* Tiny Epic Quest or Tiny Epic Galaxies
* VS System
* Epic Pvp
* Pixel Tactics

And of course there's lots of other games that will fit this criteria that I don't know about that are worth researching. 

Hope this help!

Again, I agree with your basic premise... but you're acting like anyone who isn't willing to believe this a democratic false flag is an idiot sheeple because they don't subscribe to the right wing narrative.  That is bullying, not discourse.  "

"""Two of his sisters played ball at MIZ. His aunt is the head coach here. To say he had a connection here is putting it mildly.""

...and he still chose Washington over Mizzou despite that, until they fired the coach he wanted to play for.   That's why he de-committed from Washington.  He cares about his coaching.  ... and if we know one thing about Malone, it's that his players love him. 

I can't help it if a fanbase is too self-absorbed and emotional to judge him fairly.   Any fan that thought he was trying to hurt the team/ distract from the team for his personal gain was dead wrong.  Maybe Mizzou fans have an inaccurate perception because they are too close to/ emotionally invested in Mizzou?

Look, we obviously disagree.  You aren't changing my mind, and I'm not changing yours.  Like I said, I don't want to be combative, but I think your perception about him ignores a lot of things, and is plainly wrong.   We can keep going back and forth, making zero progress to change each- other's minds.... or we can agree to disagree and leave it there...

I like how he even calls out fans like you in the video he posted.  He talks about how much he wanted to help Mizzou, but fans got negative perceptions and said nasty things about him.   He talks about how much it hurt him... then he forgives those fans.  Lol."

"Hi, 

You need to think back on what might have happened 4-6 months ago as that is when the change will have happened. Is that when you started conditioning so much? Also surely you only condition mid-lengths to ends - if so really not sure this can be causing damage. But it is probably a waste of conditioner and unnecessary... We'd also advise to stay away from the egg/oil/ACV masks versus a professional tested mask - especially in this case where you're trying to tackle hair thinning. 

Hair thinning/loss can be caused by so many factors I'd definitely first recommend getting a 'diagnosis' (even though this led to several incorrect ones for me), so I'd personally research a good dermatologist and try to go to them directly to save time as any changes take so long to see the impact you want to do what you can as quickly as possible. I went through hair loss and shared my changes here:
https://www.shampoostories.com/blogpost?id=5baad1a71f495131b19fef84

But top line, be gentle - with how you wash, what shampoo you use and your brushing to reduce breakage and damage. Focus on your nutrition and stress levels (and give it time - cycles take 6 months before you see an impact). And take photos to track the changes "

"So,  why would anyone on the Right want to kill Obama?  He is out of power,  can't run again,  the more he speaks, while it may rally the Left,  it may turn off independent voters by wondering ""When the hell is this guy going to shut up and go away?""

Why would anyone on the Right want Hillary dead?  She is the best thing the Right has.  

Why would anyone on the Right want to make anyone a martyr on the Left right before an election?

If I were into conspiracy theories I would say that these failed bombings were a conspiracy by the Left to make the Right look violent.   Anyone who hasn't toed the Left line and turned their brain off (NPC) sees the Left as more violent than the Right.   This event has allowed the NPCs to say ""See,  the Right is violent!""  This is going to be remembered in two weeks on election day because the media will keep it going.   To me,  if this is a Left Wing Conspiracy,  then it means that the Left has given up on platforms on elections.   They are vocal about their out of touch with the voters ideas.   They learned last year with them beating Roy Moore that their only chance at winning an election is smearing the other side. 

If this story dies early next month then i will know it was a Left Wing Conspiracy.  Honestly,  i hope it is because it is better than someone out there sending explosives to former elected officials.

This is one of the things that gives me the most stress and anxiety of this condition. It is one thing to go through this, and then I found that it is another thing entirely to go through this with the feeling of ‚ÄúI am doomed, it‚Äôs going to get worse and worse‚Äù all the time. I don‚Äôt mean to make light in any way of what people go through who are worse off. I can barely handle the grief I go through, so I can only imagine. But it is scary to think of sliding and never coming back. 

This is to the point that I feel constant fear and truly superstitious about speaking or writing what I have NOT been through. I am literally afraid to put it into the ether for fear of it coming to fruition. This came about after spending most of my free time in support groups (not Reddit, actually) and seeing a constant flow of these things.

I started experiencing issues in 2013, more pronounced in 2014, and since then things have been up and down but never as good as they were before I got sick... rarely even close. Everyone‚Äôs experience is different I guess. I do what I can, I try not to push myself. I don‚Äôt exercise (other than required walking, which I try to to minimize). But I do work full-time still (desk job, somewhat flexible when I really need it, very good group of people‚Äîat least for the last two years) and push through pain and fatigue when I ‚Äúhave‚Äù to. I‚Äôve cut out most of my personal life that I used to have, I take shortcuts otherwise, and I do maybe 1/10th (if that) of what I wish I could in a given month. I‚Äôve totally decided against ever having a child (I‚Äôm fairly young).

Do what you can to take care of yourself now. Be cautious. Take heed of what people say because fellow ME/CFS people almost always know best because they get it. But be careful about falling into the trap of ‚Äúthis is it‚Äù because it can be debilitating. It was for me‚ÄîI honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been more depressed or upset about anything‚Äîand I‚Äôm still trying to recover mentally and emotionally from that alone. "

And I like your point about using the characters experience to learn more about yourself. It really isn't a romantic movie, it's the ultimate break up movie. I also really appreciate that in life almost everyone will at some point be the Tom or the Summer. So maybe one day I go through a different experience and I watch that movie and I relate to Summer. Either way, that movie is full of good reminders and it calls out a lot of the typical cliche things people tend to think after break ups and all. I'll forever love this movie."

"Keep in mind that RP doesn't have to be about roleplaying ""the most powerful dude."" A lot can come out of roleplaying a hero who is completely ordinary. For example, think of Lord of the Rings, one of the most (if not the most) popular fantasy series in the entire world. The main characters are two short people who love food. That's why they are so endearing, all they wanted was to live out their lives in the Shire, but they sacrificed everything to save the world from Sauron against all odds.

Your warrior can be just a guy. A guy who is faced with people who can kill him instantly with a rifle from a distance, burn him to death painfully with magic, or protect themselves with the light while they fight him. Yet despite this, he faces these terrible dangers with nothing but the clothes on his back, and the weapon on his hip. Why? Does he do it for his own personal gain? Does he do it to protect the people he cares about? Maybe he just aspires to become a legend (very common aspiration among orcs and such.)

These questions are what make playing a warrior interesting."

"Dialogue is about the only thing I'm good at to be honest.

"I understand. Theres also the factor for big retail managment who tend to be more focused on stocking multiple departments and handling customer needs at the same time. Everyone has a job to do, and everyone has a time where they want an employee to check the back for ""3 more"" or conduct price checks (which managers usually only have price checking electronics, so an employee may need to find one)  unless you walk over to the nearest department with a price scanner. At that point, its easy to fall behind on time to stock and/or fix things up when you can.  Its all about priorities bro, and zoning was the main priority of night shift. Day and evening were often stocking.  "

"At 21 I stopped wearing makeup outside of dressing up occasionally. I found myself attractive. I realized I didn't have anything to hide. I finally loved my physical features. It was a wild moment.

"I've put a multimeter across with the engine running and between tick over and applying revs the voltage does increase which implies the Dyno is applying charge, it was somewhere in the region of 15v IIRC so it's not overcharging either. The battery is definitely on its last legs.  From a ""full charge"" if I apply my test rig headlight bulb - a 35w headlamp unit salvaged from a scooter so just under 3A load on what as far as I can tell from research is a 40Ah battery so in theory should be able to power the bulb for 12 plus hours (oddly the label is scant on info - simply says Optima X cell and that it's type 075) the voltage drops down considerably within minutes and very noticeably dimmer after ten minutes   ( this is out of the car of course with nothing else attached).    Also in the car with engine running the headlights do get brighter when you go from tickover speed to about 1500rpm where they are at peak brightness which has always been the case.

"&gt; Even though grizzlies are considered to be a subspecies of brown bear, the difference between a grizzly bear and a brown bear is fairly arbitrary

What? Why the hell are we arguing so. We both agree there's a difference but they're not a separate species. They're a subspecies but they still belong to the same species since they're able to interbreed and produce viable offspring. At the end of the day what is a subspecies and what isn't is a fairly arbitrary and not easily decided, the consensus is that grizzlies are a subspecies, that means there is a  few minor differences but they are still the same overall species of bear."

"Not necessarily. Let's say you generate 1000 brv per turn, and your max brv is 2000. Your turns will be like this:

brv, brv, hp, brv, brv, hp, brv, brv, hp, brv, brv, hp

Which means that, during these 12 turns, you have dealt a total of 8000 hp damage.

However, if your max brv is 3000, your turns will be:

brv, brv, brv, hp, brv, brv, brv, hp, brv, brv, brv, hp

Which means that, during these 12 turns, you have dealt a total of 9000 hp damage.

Higher max brv means that the character does less hp attacks overall. Remember that, overall, a turn where you hp attack is a ""wasted"" turn, since you aren't generating more damage. Also, less turns spent like this means that the character will spend less turns with 0 brv. While this, of course, favors Shiva if you're using her, it also means there are more chances to get broken, getting delayed and thus losing further time.

It's true however that there are cases of two, three-shotting where the enemy's health is not that high, but still higher than your max brv, in which your point holds true. Sadly it's not a solvable issue, as auto AI is what it is.

So my point is that having either high or low max brv have both pros and cons, but having higher max brv has more pros than the latter."

"**Normandy landings**

The Normandy landings were the landing operations on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II. Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day, it was the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the liberation of German-occupied France (and later Europe) from Nazi control, and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front.

Planning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings.

"Goblins are portrayed, at least for the rank and file, to be the weakest and stupidest of the monster races, but they are also incredibly self-aware.  They know that they suck and need to resort to complete scumbag tactics to even have a chance at survival.  This includes traps, ambushes, use of hostages; terrorism/psychological warfare; poison; fire and playing dead.  So by using guerrilla tactics as the basis for all of their combat strategies, they are sometimes able to turn obvious defeat into absurd comeback victories.  I don't remember if they gave the statistics in the manga or light novel, but I'd like to think about 80% of the episode one situations end in a complete one-sided slaughtering of the goblins, even with low level under-prepared and over-confident adventurers involved.  But those other 20% are real fucking rough.  

*If the numbers are closer to 50-50, or even worse than that, I think it makes the concept a little less interesting, so I'll maintain my head cannon unless plot points openly conflict with it.

Goblin slayer has seen that these scumbag tactics can actually be highly effective, so he has adopted them himself and is basically a one man Sun Tzu. He will gladly lie, cheat and steal his way to victory, because his opponents are not deserving of honorable conduct or respect.  

In fact, his greatest asset is his ability to seamlessly transition from tried and true basic combat tactics when things are going well, to highly unconventional, but potentially devastating strategies when his back is against the wall.  "

"This doesn't t mean this Initiative is the answer or that it is even something any of us should support.  Just because it says, ""Carbon blah blah blah"" doesn't mean we should vote for it.

First let's begin with the fact that this ""fee"" has no accountability.  None.  The board appointed by the Governor would dictate how the money that is collected is spent and there is no stipulation on which projects that money is spent on.  It requires certain seats to be appointed to labor and Native American Tribes in which they are promised a large cut of the funds generated from this Initiative.  So, straight off the top a good portion of these fee's isn't even being used for Green energy projects...

Now, let's talk about Washington States emissions.  This state is one of the lowest states in the entire nation when it comes to producing emissions.  So, what the fuck?  Why are we attacking ourselves and our poor when we are already the leader when it comes to investing in renewable energy, conservation, forests, and habitat?  Can you give me an answer to that one because I don't think you can.

This is like those idiotic recycling bullshit I found out about last night at the city council meeting where the city is paying for the name to claim themselves to be ""Green"" when the recycled items are then transported to the dump and thrown away.  Yeah, my city is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to be able to bullshit the community into believing they are doing something for the environment when in reality nothing is being done at all.

Let's really take a look at what this Initiative will do though...

Because there is no stipulation and because our state is already pretty carbon neutral there is no real benefit.

Our energy consumption in this state will decrease by 9.6% over the next decade without this initiative and nobody has stated how this initiative will increase this percentage.  In fact the very opposite of that is being stated.  It will have no effect on decreasing emissions.  None.

Gasoline emissions will decrease a further 18.5% without this initiative and there is no analysis that states this initiative will do anything to decrease this percentage further.

What it will do though is put a cost of .14 cents per gallon increase on fuel.  After that there will be a further .02 cent increase every single year.  Electricity prices will increase 2% per year and natural gas prices will increase 8.5%.

This will fuck the poor and the middle class so much it isn't even funny.  It will hit them in the items they buy and the cost to getting to work and heating their homes and in energy to light their homes.  This is a direct and massive cost being directed solely at the poor and middle class.

For fucking nothing.  Nothing.  It's so you self entitled shit bags can go around and say, ""Look at me.  I'm making a difference.  We are so progressive.  Wheeee!""

You motherfuckers!  You son of a bitches.  You fucking assholes.

This right here pisses me off so much.  Going after the poor and the middle class to subsidize your shitty ass feelings so that you can feel like you are making a difference is the biggest amount of shittiness ever.

Then you have the audacity to say, ""Well the poor and middle class will be especially harmed...""

Don't fucking try to pull my heart strings...   This initiative achieves nothing and does nothing about anything concerning climate change.

It's an initiative designed to rob from the poor and the middle class and direct riches into the Governors shitty ass friends.

Fuck them, fuck the Governor, and fuck every single person who supports this initiative.

Go ahead and tell me how this helps climate change...  Tell me how it's going to make a difference...  

SHOW ME!

You can't because it's a fucking scam.

Initiative 1631 is a virtue signalling scam designed specifically to fuck over the very people who can't afford to be fucked over.

"&gt;Because the Colts are doing so much with their franchise QB?

The Colts have gone to the play offs 3 times, won 3 play off games and went to the AFCCG since drafting Luck. The Luck era has not been a complete failure, even if they completely dropped the ball in 2015-2017 when it comes to team building.

Also, getting a franchise QB does not guarantee building a contender. But it gives you, by far, the most important and the most difficult to find part of that contender. The Colts roster is crap and the Giants roster is crap, but the Colts are much closer to being contenders because all they need is a few competent O-linemen, some good defensive pieces and suddenly they are a double digit win team again because they already have Luck."

"We have had at least one other case similar to this case here on reddit today ...heck there could be more than just one or two  but let's  not scare anyone   so  I'm only going to literally deal with reality of this case.

I want you to know I fully believe every word you are telling me in this post .... It's just that you sound like a pretty normal person who has had this sleep  or  no ability to sleep demon operating within her life and her sleep lately  ....

 So could  you possibly post and tell me in a little detail about your life's history before the onset of this profound sleep insominia ... Was that in september  .... Last month  ... that this insominia began to affect you ?  

How   did it start ?  

Were you sick in the last 3 months ...

 Any virus ever suspected to be causing you any illness with in the last 3 months ?


Has anything else changed in your life immediately before or just after you became  sick with this insominia?


Are any of your   friends sick with maybe a virus ?


Have there been any instances of viruses in the schools or any where
You visit regularily now or before you became insominia ill ?

PLEASE if you can tell me anything
About maybe being infected by any pathogens in the last 3 months ...

have you talked with  your doctor in the last 3 months ?


Are there any rumors where you live about others being affected with a sleep or no sleep illness in last few months ?


Maybe if we can have these questions answered by an intelligent 
Person such as you clearly are ....

maybe we can start to find some answers to the syndrom you are describing here. Please if you would text and answer or if you want we an do a PM in total privacy with you .... Be clear here I am trying to
Figure out what and if a pathogen is making you sick and causing this insominia to happen to you ....that is all i am asking about here.

So now we are hearing anecdotal stories of weird sleep issues affecting readers  or listeners here on reddit .... I obviously have no idea if any of these cases are linked or how they might be linked but I would bet you my life that these are very genuine people and accurate
Posts we are reading here today ...

 This and  that  other weird maybe virus that has gotten some publicity lately virus affecting and killing young children with whar is being called a polio likenillness ...

IDK and I don't want to scare anyone here on reddit but there does appear to be something really messing in several OPs sleep within the past month or two ...

 Maybe if we can text or talk with a couple of these folks we can learn more ?

Can  some  one  post  or  text ?   Is anyone else having this insomina which  just came over them In the  last month or two ?

Let's try to figure out if there is a mystery pathogen loose ...maybe a virus ...maybe something else ...is any one else having recent onset insominia issues ?

We are not talking about people like me that have well understood sleep issues for years ...rather these new cases are just starting now to have progound insomina or plain ""inability to fall asleep ?"" 

Please post more

 please does anyone think I might be onto something in these new cases?


Thank you all please post.

Thank you."

I finished up. I took all my gear off and went home. When I got home I walked into my laundry room and took my long sleeve shirt off and when I pulled it over my head a flake of metal went into my eye. I thought I got it out. I was wrong.

"&gt; I didn't. You said hardliners wouldn't care, I said potential recruits would. There is a difference there.

Yeah, I should've read that better. I still don't think it will make a difference though. If a potential recruit is considering becoming a terrorist, the current prison sentences given in his country would probably be the last thing he'd think about.
But again, we both have no sources to back our claims.

&gt; But culture is heavily intertwined with religion, and it doesn't paint the whole picture. 

Fairly good point about the Indonesia and Turkey thing, though beware not to draw conclusions too fast. Terrorist attacks in Turkey and Indonesia are prevalent. The reason why people migrate also says a lot about which kind of people they are. There aren't many Indonesians in Europe to begin with. As for Turks, most of them are descendants of labor migrants, while people from North African countries are more likely to be refugees. These people are obviously more vulnerable to extremist ideologies. 
I'm not saying that this explains everything, just that there's more to it than just culture.

"Learning about a ""system of Buddhas"" had me have the exact opposite reaction to yours. Similarly, while you were ascending to cloud nine while reading ombra_rosa's post, I was descending to, uh, soil nine? Funny how that works.

The thing that sticks out the most to me in your post is that you seem to think that the Theravadin presentation of Buddhism is the correct one. Thus you are distressed about a gulf that exists between Buddhas and Arhats. To a Mahayana practitioner though this would be a non-issue since the practice itself is for becoming a Buddha. According to the Lotus Sutra, even Arhats will become Buddhas later. Again, funny how that works. Maybe the problem then is the framework you base yourself in.

Millions of arguments about the subject of whether materialism is actually right out not can be given. It's all meaningless. The bottom line though is that your ""realm of the possible"" isn't actually necessarily correct. What sense is there then in being frustrated at the things in this teaching that are not in accordance with the views you conjured up for yourself? "

no it shouldn't that how you get stupid fucking penalties like a DE toughing a QB helmet is now a penalty. If a defender lowers his shoulder puts his head in a position that would be safe and the offensive player makes a move that puts his head in danger thats on him. Incidental shouldn't be a penalty. There are too many goddamn penalties on defenders these days might as well switch to fucking flag football. and it feels like everything that isn't encroachment/offsides/neutral zone infraction is an automatic first down or 10 yds so effectively an automatic first down.

"I sit on the bench next to him, a slight distance between us. Rather than speak, instead I watch the sunset. 

Together, we watch the passing of time, and I notice a faraway look on his face. Perhaps the only true indication of his age. 

""Give me some advice,"" I tell him. 

He arches a brow, puffing out a little breath from his nose, to which I simply smile. 

""Call it a hunch, but I reckon you have it in you. Good advice, that is."" 

He laughs, shakes his head. His eyes never quite drift away from that sunset. ""I'm afraid I offer nought but the worst."" 

""And I tell you I've already been given the worst."" 

His lips curl, and after a moment of contemplation he finally relents. He turns to look at me with a face that doesn't look a day over twenty. A facade. ""Very well. What ails you?""

""The same thing that you face. But the opposite, I guess."" 

""Meaning?"" 

""I'm going to die soon. Months, I've been given."" In spite of myself, I let out a laugh. A bitter, choked sound. ""Doctor could barely look me in the eye when he gave me the news.""

""There's no good way to give it,"" he concedes. 

""I suppose. But, still, it hounds me.""

""What does?""

""Knowing. Knowing that I'll die before I can experience most of what life can offer; I won't marry, I won't find love, I ‚Äì *I* won't be a mum ‚Äì christ, I'm sorry, I always wanted a daughter. It's just so *unfair.* All of it. That things could have been different. And I can't reconcile it. How can I enjoy what time I have left when all I think about is the time I won't have?""

""And you tell me this because you know I don't die."" 

I look at him, meeting his unrelenting glare with bloodshot eyes. I hadn't meant to cry, they'd just come as they usually do. Always at the worst times. I simply nod, unable to articulate a response. 

He places an arm on my shoulder, a little too timidly, and leans back. He sighs. ""You'll hate me no matter what I say.""

""I'm long beyond hate."" 

""You can't be past hatred. It's the only thing that persists, in both life and death. We may love a thousand times, fire fading and lighting anew each time, but hate is like a seed in the dirt. It grows, feeds on those around it, and does not stop even when we ourselves join it in the ground. It carries from generation to generation, life to life, heart to head."" 

""Until the plant itself withers and dies."" 

He chuckles. ""Perhaps. I would not know. Maybe by my one-thousandth year, I will find out. Perhaps my ten-thousandth. But I digress, I cannot offer you peace of mind in death; would that I could but, alas, I can barely do myself the courtesy. No, instead, I can tell you this: the minutes you spend on this bench, talking to a mere husk, are not worth your time.""

""What is, at this point?""

""Everything. Whatever you wish. Your moments are precious. That the end-point is closer does not invalidate the journey, the experience. We have both been dealt a cursed hand by fate, this I shan't deny, but we must make the best of what we are given, lest we end up with nothing at the end of it all."" 

""Easy for you to say."" 

""Believe me, it is not.""

So, ultimately, he's just telling me what everybody else has been. I feel robbed. Eight-hundred years and he has nothing to show from it. I lean back, sniffling slightly. ""I guess I shouldn't have expected more from this conversation.""

""People tend to expect the best of me. I peaked at age forty, and I've been perpetually plateauing since.""

""What did you do at age forty?""

""Overthrow an Empire. Become a King. The usual."" 

""Sounds like you've lived an interesting life."" 

""And yet here I am. In the end, it amounted to me sitting on this miserable bench watching a sun set every day. Time makes a fool of us all.""

I lean next to him, a tad closer, and cock my head. ""Ironic."" 

""Yeah, it is, isn't it?"" 

""What's your name, then?""

""Just call me Anu. And to whom do I have the pleasure of addressing?"" 

""Eren.""  

""Eren, you asked of me advice. And I gave you it, although no doubt it lacked in your eyes. So, instead, let me gift you something else. My time, for yours. I cannot make you live longer than fate deems appropriate, but my centuries have not been without their fruits. Ask of me something, and I shall provide it."" 

I consider the proposition. I have nothing else to think on, and so it occupies my mind, silencing me. ""Well, I've always wanted to see the Northern Lights, I guess. They're supposed to be beautiful.""

""Then we shall fly to Alaska. And, if it is not there, Canada. If not, Iceland, and Norway after.""

He smiles, a childlike expression on his youthful features. ""We shall chase the lights, until your wish is fulfilled. This is my promise, Eren."" 

""And now my turn. I have some advice for you."" 

""And what would that be?"" 

""Pack some warm clothes."" 

""Duly noted. So, tell me, will taking you to see the Northern Lights at least ease your sorrow?""

I pause, and shake my head. ""No, it won't. Maybe it'll ease yours. With luck, the experience might help me temporarily forget it ‚Äì push it to a corner of my mind, perhaps. But it'll persist, like it always does."" 

""So why did you agree?""

""Because I want to live. And, until then, nothing else matters. And I want you to do the same, because a life that never ends should not be spent in misery, just as a life soon to end should not be filled with sorrow. It just took a conversation with an immortal for me to realise time is not valuable in and of itself, it's what we do with it that is. The moments we make."" 

Once more, he smiles, and I realise he wears it awkwardly. Like a mask ‚Äì no, an unfamiliar motion entirely. His muscles twitch, and he shows too much teeth. 

I let out a slight laugh. 

""What's so funny?"" He asks innocently, the smile fading as quickly as it had come. A single moment, precious because it had barely been there. 

""Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's find a flight to catch."" "

EDIT: This may have come across a little mean, and for that I'm sorry. And while I'm glad that religion has helped you and can be the answer some people are looking for, to assert that God is the answer for everybody is not just immoral, ignorant, and arrogant, it's also dangerous. Thinking that everyone depression can be treated the same way with 100% certainty is part of the reason why so many are struggling with depression today. If religion provides someone a sense of comfort, a kind ear to listen and a community that loves them, then absolutely they should go for it. But for someone like me who is uncomfortable with the interpretations man has made with the word of God, then religion provides me no comfort, no kind ears, and a community who would rather enjoy watching me suffer because they've convinced themselves it's what their God wants.

For some, God is the answer. Others, medicine. Others still, anything that provides them a modicum of comfort in this world that can be both unimaginably cruel and beautiful that we spend so short a time in.

I wish you luck on your journey, brother."

You've done a marvelous work on HMS Warspite here SpaceCadetPip. Here's an epitaph dedicated to her from one of her many crewmen, Lt. Commander R A B Mitchell

*You say you have no subject
And your brushes all have dried;
But come to Marazion
At the ebbing of the tide.*

*And look you out to seaward,
Where my Lady battle scarred
Hugs the rock that is more welcome,
Than the shameful breakers yard.*

*Paint her there upon the sunset
In her glory and despair,
With the diadem of victory
Still in flower upon her hair.*

*Let her whisper as she settles
Of her blooding long ago,
In the mist than mingles Jutland
With the might of Scapa Flow.*

*Let her tell you, too, of Narvik
With its snowy hills, and then
Of Matapan, Salerno
And the shoals of Walcheren;
And finally of Malta,
When along the purple street
Came in trail the Roman Navy
To surrender at her feet.*

*Of all these honours conscious,
How could she bear to be
Delivered to the spoiler
Or severed from the sea?*

*So hasten then and paint her
In the last flush of her pride
On the rocks of Marazion,
At the ebbing of the tide.*

You do NOT treat someone that way, especially not a brand new employee.  I yelled right back at him that it was her workstation and she could set it up any way she wanted to.  He ran away.

A few days later, he approached her and asked politely if she would mind setting it up another way.  What was really funny was that he was looking at me the whole time he was speaking to her, ready to flee at a moment's notice.

The VP was several levels above me but there comes a time when you have to protect your employees from management, no matter who they are.

"&gt;Of course you do. Whether an investment is sound or not is entirely dependent on the rate of return, and the rate of return is heavily dependent on the future of prices.

People start businesses because there is a demand for a good or service, not based on the cost of the input.  Businesses fill customer needs, they don't materialize because of supplies/labor is ""cheap"".  You make investments in a business along the same lines.  If there isn't sufficient customer demand then you don't invest.  This is true in a low-inflation/deflationary environment and a high-inflation environment.  

I mean it doesn't become necessarily easier to make investments with higher inflation.  It is a variable, but not a decision-making one.  Real costs and revenues actually do matter, not just trying to get ahead of higher nominal prices.

&gt;Let's take a very simple example. I have $100 in cash. There is a stock X that I can buy that does not change in real value, and gives a 0.5% dividend per year. Should I buy it in the absence of any other investment options? If inflation is zero, then the answer is yes. If inflation is negative one percent, then the answer is no.

First, I am assuming you are referring to some sort of preferred, bond or fixed income sort of vehicle because common stocks aren't priced or valued that way.  

Second, let me walk thru your example. Inflation is MINUS 1%.  I have $100 cash.  I could buy a $100 stock - that is going to stay at $100 and get paid a .50 dividend OR I can just keep my $100 cash.

Under the circumstances you stated, I buy the stock.  Why?  Well, 100 cash will be worth $101 in real terms after a year of -1% inflation.  BUT, though the stock remains at $100 nominally speaking, it too is now worth $101 in real terms when I sell it.  AND I get an additional .50 dividend.  

The better example might be if the stock's nominal yield was negative instead of positive - and as we have seen in Europe, as long as expectations of rates are even more negative, you could actually see the value of such instruments rise.

&gt;It would have helped if you had responded to the hypothetical business examples I gave in my post - delaying expansion into new territories and laying people off because of reduced revenues.

Once again there is this underlying assumption that businesses can't grow or expand if nominal price levels aren't consistently rising.  It is about real prices and incomes, not nominal ones.   You don't see extra business expansion just because inflation is a bit higher and you can see contractions if inflation is too hot.  

Additionally, business expansion and investment needs to be driven by real growth not cheap-debt financed growth.  If there is real additional demand for a service or good, you can evaluate expansion.  This real demand isn't driven by inflation or price levels.  Funny enough, lower input prices and rents could actually make expansion easier versus ever increasing ones.  

Just look at much of the mom-and-pop retail spaces here in NYC.  They are EMPTY.  It isn't because of dreaded deflation, but excessive low-interest rate, debt-driven asset appreciation that has shot rents to astronomical levels.  NO ONE CAN AFFORD THE RENT as if the risks of running a business.

Again.  This is reality.  I have been walking down blocks with ""For rent"" signs for YEARS now.  

I am sorry, but after nearly two decades of working in finance and on a trading desk, I simply don't believe half of the propaganda economists spill and see the dogmatic deflation trope as a perfect example of fear mongering via baseless and self-serving threats of economic collapse.

"I might not scout this time around.. depending on how much I have. I want to at least have enough for two scouts for Sky Nozomi when she comes out without dipping too deep into my Nozomi birthday fund. But anyway..

When I first got into LL, Rin was one of my worst girls. I didn't hate her or anything, she just didn't stand out to me at all. (Granted, this was very early in, I might not have even seen the anime yet.) Eventually, I took note of her voice.. It has a very specific quality that I can't quite put into words that I really love. Like.. it's very pure sounding, I guess? But not in a boring way. I really really came to like it, and slowly started noticing her more after that. Her short hair which I thought was boring before became SO charming to me, and her nyas are so cute! When I got to her Love Wing Bell episode, I ended up crying. After that, she rose really quickly in my best girls list.. She's 3rd in u's for me and probably like 5th overall. It doesn't sound that high but I really do appreciate her!

That being said, if I do end up scouting for her birthday box this year, I'd love to get her Initial. It's actually one of my favorite cards of her unidolized. I also wouldn't mind Constellation or Pool. All her URs are lovely!

Good luck everyone!"

"True but not true. I was a mechanic at multiple dealers. They usually only keep lower mileage trade ins they can make a large profit on. Toyota 4runners more specifically tend to hold their value. So once they purchase the vehicle, there is a cost associated with refurbishing such as cleaning and mechanical maintenance like brakes and tires. Once all of this is completed... it leaves very little room for profit. So they tend to keep lower mileage cars where they can just service the brakes and do an oil change for it to pass a safety used vehicle inspection. You have just as much risk buying from a dealer as you would a small car lot. The best advise I can give to you comes in two words. Maintenance records. Ask for maintenance records, if they can‚Äôt provide you. Get the vin, call a dealer. Ask if any dealers have completed warranty work. Then call that dealer and ask if there is any service records. If they‚Äôre isn‚Äôt.... the car wasn‚Äôt likely maintained as per the service schedule and I‚Äôd tread with warning as to purchasing this specific vehicle. "

So trying to find a way to control the game could be something that even a philosophically risk-averse individual might be happy doing.

"I‚Äôm completely surrounded, but then again, so are they. They‚Äôve brought me to a small clearing in the forest, but what they don‚Äôt know yet, is this is where I feel most comfortable.

The first man steps forward, his fingers arched in Tiger Style.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I exclaim.

He stops. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

I point behind him. ‚ÄúThere.‚Äù

Everyone looks to where I‚Äôm pointing, but they don‚Äôt understand.

‚ÄúA tree?‚Äù one of them says.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù I say, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúA tree.‚Äù I step over to the tree closest to me. ‚ÄúA tree can take many forms.‚Äù 

They‚Äôve grown impatient and begin to come after me.

I sweep my hand over a branch, peeling off a strip of bark. I whip it into the first man‚Äôs knees, his stomach, and finally, across his face. He falls to the ground with a thud. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs bark,‚Äù I say, as the others begin to creep forward carefully.

My fingers pluck at the tree again. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs pine needles,‚Äù I say as I rush forward, sticking the next man in the neck. He freezes, his eyes filling with alarm. ‚ÄúWatch out for those pressure points,‚Äù I say with a grin as he falls at my feet.

I look at the rest of the men, waving them forward with my fingers. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs next?‚Äù

They run forward and I duck away, through the trees and towards my cabin. They follow me through the open door.

I back away. ‚ÄúA tree can also be other things,‚Äù I tell them. I pick up a piece of paper from my desk, spinning it from my hands like a throwing star. It hits my target right in the eye and he falls to his knees. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs paper.‚Äù

I dart forward to my workbench, sweeping my hand over the surface. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs sawdust,‚Äù I say as I blow a puff of it towards the next man. He chokes and backs away out the door.

There‚Äôs one man left. 

I narrow my eyes. ‚ÄúA tree can even be a wall,‚Äù I tell him. I get a running start, my feet traveling up the wall. I flip into my last opponent, catching him right in the chest. He topples to the ground.

I stand triumphantly. ‚ÄúThe stiffest tree is most easily cracked.‚Äù

The victim of my sawdust attack crawls back through the door. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in for it now,‚Äù he tells me. ‚ÄúHere comes the Big Moss!‚Äù

I peel off my red and black flannel. I‚Äôm ready."

"I imagine a lot of people agree with you they probably just downvoted instead of saying anything, but in a game where everything in the open world scales so you are never truly getting stronger and where pvp is equalized to balance ilvl difference, the only place it seems to have any effect is dungeons and raids.

If they consider this mindless AP grind as a way to offset the balance between time required to make a character better vs how much free gear they hand out it's not very fun. I would prefer they made the AP grind account wide and made it harder to get gear. That's just my opinion though as I prefer running dungeons and raids over doing WQ and farming islands."

"5* Wyrmprint | Effect | Explanation
----|-----|-----
Levin's Champion | HP70 = Crit Rat +6%, Crit DMG+10% | Self explanatory, there is no situation in which this WP is not useful as long as you dodge attacks
Valiant Crown | Skill DMG+20%, STR Doublebuff+5% | Skill DMG always nice to have, and if you're lucky enough to have a weapon that can reliably give a DEF buff, it's just more STR on top
Give Me Your Wounded | Recovery+8%, FullHP = DEF+10% | Only 5* Healing WP aside from Auspex's Prayer which is much worse
Evening of Luxury | FullHP = STR+10%, Crit DMG+10% | Crit DMG is always good, and this is especially nice for wands/bows since they can just dodge easy and stay at full HP.

4* Wyrmprint | Effect | Explanation
----|-----|-----
Flower in the Fray | Crit DMG+10%, Skill DMG+10% | Discount Levin's Champion, substitutes crit rate for skill dmg
The Warrioresses | Force Strike+20%, Crit DMG+8% | Always good to have crit, some adventurers like Xander can abuse the Force Strike damage
Happier Times | FullHP = Skill DMG+25%, Skill Haste+3% | Good for wands/bows
Together We Stand | Striker's Strength+3%, Skill DMG+10% | Absolutely broken on adventurers who already have Striker's Strength and abuse Force Strikes like Xander
One with the Shadows | Crit Rate+4%, Broken Punisher+10% | Always good to have crit, broken punisher helps close out boss fights faster
How to Flee Properly | Recovery+3%, Last DEF+40% | Last DEF is relatively useless since healers shouldn't be taking that much damage, but the recovery potency is worthwhile
Sniper's Allure | Broken Punisher+15%, Skill Prep+10% | Skill Prep is relatively useless but broken punisher helps close out boss fights more quickly
Sisters of the Anvil | STR Doublebuff+5%, Stun RES+15% | Stun RES is relatively useless, but better side of useless since Stun is easily one of the worst status afflictions. Otherwise it's a discount Valiant Crown"

"""We don't know"" is not an answer but avoiding the question like ""god works in mysterious ways"".

There has to be an answer and there are only two choices which is the universe was unintended and created by pure chance, or intended and created by god. 

Experiments tried to confirm the former and ended up disproving it by not finding what they expect to find for an unintended universe to exist. 

Given the facts we have at hand, why should we insist that the universe was not intentionally created? How long are we going to use the excuse ""we don't know"" until we accept that there is nothing more to find and that the asymmetry does not exist? Can you even prove that there is an asymmetry that has yet to be found?"

"DON'T MILL ANY CARDS!!! Your collection will be automatically milled before the update, and you will get full scrap value for all of them.

To get the most benefit before the HC update, play the game as much as you can now and build up as many resources as you can. The more cards you have, the more will be milled for full value (maximum possible outcome for all time), and the more scraps you will have to craft what you want after the update.

Since it is out on PC already, you can learn what the new game will be like by watching streamers on Twitch (search for ""Gwent""), or finding videos on youtube."

"Ditch the pack cover. Water pools in the bottom of pack covers, right down where your quilt/sleeping bag is probably packed. Not to mention they suck in the wind. I spent 30 days in Iceland, at least half of them in heavy rain, and fell and fully submerged my pack in a river, and nothing inside my pack got wet. No pack cover, just a trash compactor bag liner for the bulk of my stuff including my quilt (stuffed in the bottom not in a stuff sack or dry bag), and I used a turkey bag for a second ‚Äúcompartment‚Äù of dry goods at the top of my pack like hat, gloves, and insulated jacket since I was accessing them throughout the day more often than I would on a US mountains in the summer trip. 

TLDR: if your stuff is getting wet with a pack liner, it‚Äôs likely user error, not the pack liner. Maybe a tear, or insufficient twist/fold at the top"

I'm level 60 Red Mage: same as above except I time my embolden uses properly to maximize dps along with using Cortex sixte.

"Asian here, not American though. But anyway, can relate to what you mean. Many people in my country also believe that hitting their children is totally normal and fine to do. Why? Because they were hit and they're ""fine"" now. If it's not right to hit an adult, why would you do it to a child? 

I don't think it's just Asians who suffer from this sort of thinking though, just that Asians tend to be stuck in this loop of conservatism and that you're born as an investment to your parents and are supposed to return such profits upon becoming an adult. Kids are not properties. "

It shouldn't take 300 pages to explain.


Here's my method of algorithmic problem solving off the top of my head:

&amp;nbsp;


1) Dont do it. 
 
  Spend a lot of thought on this question: does this need to be done at all?  The fastest code is code never written, and it is always defect free.

&amp;nbsp;


2) Can it be done in one instruction?

  Are you overthinking this problem?  Can a simple operation do the trick?  Are you certain?

&amp;nbsp;

3) Can it be done with no branches?

  Branch free code is fast and has one code path to test.

&amp;nbsp;

4) Can this problem be solved in constant time? 
     
  A great many problems are solvable in constant time if that is all that is allowed to be considered.

&amp;nbsp;

5) Can the problem be pre-computed?

  If the problem is not constant, maybe it can be pre-computed and compiled into constant time code.

&amp;nbsp;

6) Can the problem be done in sublinear time?  

  But is sublinear time actually faster in this case than linear time?  Sublinear code is often slower in real world cases because of loss of cache.
   If it is faster (as measured with an external stopwatch) , is the increased code complexity worth the speed-up?

&amp;nbsp;

7) Can the problem be solved in fast linear time?

  Fast linear time means computation running through a cache and pipeline, rather than random access.  This usually entails an array.

&amp;nbsp;

8) Can the problem be solved in linear time with random access on data structures.

   Example is linked list, linear but slow linear because of loss of cache and pipeline.

&amp;nbsp;

9) Can the problem be done in N log N time?

&amp;nbsp;

10) Spend more brain cycles on steps 1-9.

&amp;nbsp;

11) Whats the smallest piece of code that can solve this problem.

  Can you make it smaller?

&amp;nbsp;


Solve real problems.  There are an infinite number of imaginary problems that are pointless to examine.  Identify real customers and their needs, don't imagine them.

If you find yourself using complicated data structures and fancy algorithms, you probably made a misstep.  Be sure you are getting payed for that crap.

You might be right, but I don‚Äôt know.

They would still get married in the church and have a marriage license from the Church etc. It would just no longer be the government‚Äôs term.

To me it seems like it should be a non issue to have the churches be the arbiter of who is married and who isn‚Äôt. That means that gay people can get married in their liberal churches or whatever they decide and get legal rights from the government under a different label while conservatives will just do as they‚Äôve always done and the government can‚Äôt force them to accept gay ‚Äòmarriage‚Äô that they don‚Äôt believe in."

Planned Parenthood in California was just doing a metabolic panel and wasnt looking at hormone levels initially.  I asked at the 3-4 month mark and then they started including the hormone level check for T and E.  So I would assume if you havent gotten those numbers then they arent checking them and you need to ask next time you go in.  They said they didnt think it important to check earlier than then when I asked.  Just fyi from my experience.

Its time to consider living life to the max. Instead of drinking, you are GOING TO crank up your drive to the max. You're going to hit each and every one of these stupid effing meetings and responsibilities. Wherever  possible, if it's a rubbish meeting, you are going to hijack it like the manic AA newcomer that you are and share about your life and your problems. These people have connections, opportunities, friends, and most importantly--they have money. They will offer you help-- if and only if they think you are worthy of them sticking their neck out for you. Hit the Donations and dress the part. You'll be surprised how much good business-casual stuff they have and slick back your hair.  Dont have gel? Walk into a salon or Target and put on some of theirs on without buying it. The free sample one. At the very least you can make a friend who can help you do the community service hours for half or something that would sign off on it.its unethical but you could use a tad hit of help here so if you have to to get on your feet take a shortcut or two but remember that shortcuts arent gonna help u in the end.

You're going to introduce yourself to anyone who makes eye( contact after these groups and ask them how they are doing and listen a  bit too. Get out of of yournhead by asking other people how they are and offering out your help wherever possible. Set up groups and tear down chairs and stack them however after the meeting.

You are going to bring the type of manic intensity to getting back on your feet that you brought to drinking and whatever else got you here (gambling, anger indulgence, risky behavior including drugs). And by the time you are done with those volunteer hours switch your find a way to squeeze in at the end of the night it's gonna feel like you blinked and it was done with. Come on dude you're down in the dumps and you fucked your whole life up and the next step is to either fix your life or you think about drinking 24/7 or you end up in more houses and institutions if youre lucky. Include jail and stuff in there along with death tbh as possibilities. It's an obvious decision to me. It's time to get off your ass and you man the you want to be. 

This time there's not gonna be any shortcuts; you can pass off the AA and the Christian guy as drivel but the fact the matter is your way isn't working for you. Your best efforts thus far have got you down on skid row and that should be enough to open your mind up to sitting down &amp; listening to something new.

Using the word ‚Äúearthquakes‚Äù is somewhat misleading. A better word would be microseisms.

"I prefer ao3 for most of the reasons articulated by callmesalticidae. I'd add that I like how easy ao3 makes it to make tiny edits as opposed to ffn, with all the exporting and whatnot. It's just a few extra steps, but a few I'd rather not have to take them when I realize I forgot an apostrophe.

The quality of feedback that I get on ao3 tends to be better. I've seen great comments on other stories on ffn -- and I've gotten some really helpful comments there as well -- but the vast majority are from people begging for  updates, comments that are painfully misspelled/grammatically incorrect to the point that I don't know what they say or, the most common, comments like ""loved this chapter!"" Those last are nice enough, really, but I tend to have better true critics on ao3 (and, for what it's worth, I don't write slash.)

I do despise the over-tagging on ao3. If there's more than a handful, I usually just scroll on past."

"Good. Instead of ""Beyond Meat"" we will have ""beyond cow"" or ""beyond turkey"" etc. You could even have a tagline ""no turkeys were killed during the making of this Tofurky Roast Alternative"".

Pork and bacon should be forced to be called pig flesh (How's a 'dead pig's stomach strip sound for breakfast?'). Hamburgers should be forced to be labeled ""dead cow flesh sandwich"".

Why do they get to call veal 'veal' instead of 'dead male calf'.

Make dairy companies label how many animals they slaughter yearly on the package. So every gallon of (cow) milk would have to cite how many male calves were killed to produce the 'milk' the consumer is buying. There should be warnings about puss cells too!

If vegan things have to say ""alternative"" than the meat options should be forced to show images of the true conditions of their animals, not a fake happy farm. THAT is misleading to consumers."

Given enough time, any empty space in the skull will be filled with cerebrospinal fluid - you'll just have more than the average person, to fill the extra space.

If you have a big stroke and some of the brain dies, that tissue will very gradually be broken down and taken away, until there's nothing left but some residual fibrous webbing and the fluid. In the interim, the dead brain is still there taking up space.

If you lose some brain all in one go, like through surgery, the space will initially be filled with a combination of blood, serum and dead tissue, as well as CSF. These will all be gradually broken down and absorbed (at different rates) and the empty space filled with CSF.

The empty space should never be filled with ""fatty tissue"" (i.e adipose). Normal brain is pretty lipid rich, though, so while it's still being broken down, you could call that debris ""fatty tissue"" if you wanted to, but that might confuse people."

"You will need a lot of Fate.

You'll get 12 free confessions by the end of the festival. Since each upgrade needs 2 confessions, that's enough for 6 companions.

To get the other 5 companions (assuming you have two Scuttering Squads and can get two Unassuming Judges), you'll need an additional 12 confessions (Scuttering squads upgrades require 3 confessions). That will be 180 Fate.

If you want to get The Contrarian's Weapon on top of all that, it will need an additional 10 confessions ie 150 more Fate.

The fact that you can *only* get more Confessions by buying Fate is proving quite unpopular with the player base right now. I'm not sure if this was intended right from the start, or if FBG might listen to the feedback and add a non-Fate way of getting more confessions. If I were you I'd wait a few days before spending Fate on companions, but it's completely up to you."

"How many litters have you temperment tested and how many puppy classes have you taught. How many of those dogs do you know well into adulthood? The answer for me is ""too many to count"". The patters of well bred vs badly bred vs true mutt are clear.

Genetics are a major indicator of behaviour. If a dog has the genetics to guard, it is likely they will. If they have the genetics to herd, likely they will. With mixed breed puppies, they have a lot more genetic drives influencing the behaviour. It can be very difficult to predict which ones woll come out. And sometimes they are in conflict, see a dog who has the instinct to be friendly with strangers but also guards space."

"I'm pretty when almost any historian says ""all of Europe and most of the Middle East and North Africa"" they mean the posh upper class families and neighborhoods, because that's what the spread mainly was confined to (or in the city of Rome, at least).

"When I was at college applying for university, I was really excited to get independence; live on my own, cook for myself, have my own space and decide what to decorate it with etc. I was also excited to live in a different part of the UK nearly 200 miles away since I've stayed in my area my entire life. The day to move to university came and I was eager to leave home to start my life at university, meet my flatmates and go out for a drink to mark our first day at university. We got to my accommodation and set everything up, went out for lunch and bought some groceries to start me off for the week.

&amp;#x200B;

The time came to say goodbye to my mum and brother, and it slowly started to hit me. After they got in the car and left, I was there standing in my room completely alone not knowing what I was doing. It fully hit me that I was completely alone and was here until next year. Homesickness creeped in and I just sat there staring at the wall feeling sick and alone. I met my flatmates and they seemed cool, but we didn't click like I expected we would. They kept to themselves and didn't have any interest in going out, so I spent the night doing nothing but watching videos drinking the rum and coke I brought with me.

&amp;#x200B;

As the days and weeks went on, I realised I hate being this far away from my friends and family; I hate how unfamiliar my surroundings are and I hate that I have to wait 3 months to finally go back home for christmas. I only made one friend so far and I only see him twice a week, so the other 5 days I'm in my room doing nothing but watching videos, playing games and occasionally going out for a walk. I realised I made a mistake choosing this university; all in all it's a great university and if I lived closer I would be alright, but being nearly 200 miles away from my family and friends makes me feel really anxious and out the loop. I can't occasionally go home because it costs ¬£65 for a return train ticket home, which I can't afford to do. There are no societies I want to join because nothing interests me, I want to go out and socialise but I don't know how, and if I get the chance to I feel an overwhelming sense of dread at the thought of it. I had it built up in my mind that university is the best time of your life from the stories my brother told me, but so far it's been an anxiety filled nightmare that I financially/realistically can't escape from. I want to quit but I need the degree, I can move to a different university next year but the thought of staying here until May completely fills me with dread. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Applied to university excited and full of expectations, came to university stressed, anxious and realising that I chose the wrong university."

"At some level, the three worlds I have thought anything about are all in some vague way linked into a single world, but at very different times. Anyway... I present:  


**Titanbound**  


Titanbound all began with one dumb idea: an inn. A very large inn. An absurdly palatial inn of many balconies and dining rooms and bars. This inn hangs on chains. These chains are carried by... Titans. Four of them. Four chains.   


Titans in this setting are not your standard little tiny 10ft tall giants, or even your 100ft titans. These guys wade through oceans and stand head and shoulders (possibly waist?) above the clouds. They are magically bound stone. Imagine the bosses of Shadow of the Colossus writ absolutely enormous.   


Back to the inn. It stomps around. It gathers weary adventures, swooping down to land with a great grinding of rocks next to a road. It visits warzones, adjudicating conflicts. If necessary, it may step on a city.   


In this Inn live some number (it varies each time I revisit this) of immortals. The Barkeep, the Proprietor, the Stablehand... etc. These are the Titanbound, and are close to being gods within their desmesne (the Inn).   


Okay so then I wanted some other Titans. There's a hunched over man with a quaint village of Titanbound in his hand and fields on his arms and shoulders. There's a tall man carrying a lantern that is a monastery.   


Then I decided these were only the Earth titans. The Water titans are huge whales of stone with cove-port cities governed by titanbound inside their sheltered mouths. The Air titans are a pair of huge airborne settlements that chase each other around the globe and their soldiers descend to conquer the lands they pass in the name of their diametrically opposed beliefs. One a flying manta ray casting a vast shadow, the other a sinuous glowing serpent that casts a brilliant illumination. "

"Some of how they might treat/respond to you is going to be based off how you interact with them. If you immediately tell them that you have seen all of that critical information and ask difficult questions (like asking about Xenu, disconnection, The Hole, etc) they might just kind of put you on the back burner and mostly ignore you. They might also attempt to convince you that all of those claims by critics are made up, overblown, something done by a few evil people in the past who have all been kicked out, or otherwise not an issue. That is kind of dependent upon the individual you wind up talking to. 

However, if you go in acting like a new person who knows nothing they will likely have you watch some information videos on their display panels. They will likely ask you if you want to do a personality test and possibly be a little pushy about convincing you to take it. They will certainly try and sell you books and try and convince you to take an introductory course (possibly a Life Improvement course or the Success Through Communications course, Problems of Work seminar, or the Dianetics Seminar). Which course(s) they push will depend somewhat on that particular staff's ability and confidence in delivering certain courses. The Org where I was on staff really loved the Problems of Work seminar and tried to get most new people to do that (for example). 

Its not really out of the ordinary, but their methods will remind you more of a used car salesman trying to get you to buy a car, or as previously mentioned by another user a timeshare company trying to hard sell you on buying into their timeshare. Its possibly ""out of the ordinary"" when you consider that the organization tries to present itself as a ""church"" rather than a business intent on selling you something. 

Be prepared to say no repeatedly if you are not interested or willing to purchase anything from them (if you are interested in buying anything I highly recommend ebay, amazon, or other services like that. You can find them cheaper and not be supporting the CofS with your business). Also be prepared for them to attempt to separate you and your boyfriend to sales pitch you individually. This is especially done if you do the personality test as they will try and ""give you the results"" individually, which is just a tactic to get you alone, convince you that you have some kind of problem, then sell you their ""solution"" to that problem. 

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, be prepared for the staff to be friendly, welcoming, and all smiles. This is partially because they are trying to sell you something, partially because the staff likely do believe they are a great humanitarian organization saving the world, and partially because being ""down tone"" (showing sadness, being angry, or generally not being a happy and content) while on post and dealing with public can get them in trouble. Do not be surprised if besides some possible pushy sales attempts they generally seem like nice people. In all likelihood most of them genuinely are. Most people who are willing to work 50 hours a week for almost no pay in something they believe is a great humanitarian effort do so because its a cause they believe in and because they genuinely want to help others. 

Also, as a side note, please remember that these particular individuals are not the ones causing the abuses you hear about. The people working at a Class V org like the one you are visiting are most likely just victims of a predatory organization who are only pushing Scientology and trying to convince you to join because they themselves are victims. Please don't mock or ridicule them. Please try and remember that most of them are likely good people at heart who are trying to do good and that this is being taken advantage of by a manipulative organization. Hopefully you wouldn't have been rude anyway, but I just like to put it out there."

Please note how good the defenses of most of the QBs you listed are, and their running games and oline, I think you'll notice Jameis is far behind all of those guys in help, outside of wide receivers. Also like 5 of those QBs will be retiring within a season or two, so age is definitely an asset.


&gt;You can make the argument at their best....


Thats a silly argument. What about Jameis at his best? At least try to be objective. "

Noice
"You guys know that Arthur was the highest transfer from our history, right? 30mi plus bonuses surely is insignificant for a top tier club like Barca, but to Gr√™mio it was considered as a very good sell. The only thing that annoyed the fans here was that Arthur was supposed to play until the end of the year, trying to win the Copa Libertadores twice in a row and its departure out of nowhere kind of got us into a slump for a short time. But rest assured that the differences between Europe and South American realities make impossible for us to feel robbed, specially when comparing other brazilian transfers that seemed so desperate."

"I'm very impressed with what you've been able to do so far. My advice to you from someone 10+ years in the industry:

1. Learn to code. It will help you in whatever you do. Especially if you want to get more and more into digital marketing.

2. Keep up your business if you can! Making $36K in digital marketing is exactly the kind of experience that most people that work in agencies won't have. Hell, you might even be able to pay off your loans if you keep it up. That is a killer interview topic for a job or an internship.

3. Get internships at companies that you might want to get a job at. Ideally you should go to San Fran or New York. Those are the top two, but Chicago or LA work too.

"&gt; Trump isn‚Äôt a supposed ‚Äúimpartial and unbiased‚Äù source. &gt; The press however is supposed to be.


Wrong. media can be biased thanks to the Supreme Court, FCC, [Regan's Veto &amp; Bush Sr. veto'ing of the 1949 FCC Fairness doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine#Revocation):

&gt; he fairness doctrine of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), introduced in 1949, was a policy that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was‚Äîin the FCC's view‚Äîhonest, equitable, and balanced. The FCC eliminated the policy in 1987 and removed the rule that implemented the policy from the Federal Register in August 2011.[1]

Ironically, the guy who spearheaded the motion (Fowler) said he did it as a matter of principal and admitted that repealing the policy would be politically unwise. He described the staff's position as saying to Reagan:

‚Äú	The only thing that really protects you from the savageness of the three networks‚Äîevery day they would savage Ronald Reagan‚Äîis the Fairness Doctrine, and Fowler is proposing to repeal it![34]	‚Äù

lol. Now we have Fox News ""Fair &amp; Balance"" &amp; CNN Propaganda... WOoo hoo Go Republicans!

Also, to counter your claim

&gt; Trump isn‚Äôt a supposed ‚Äúimpartial and unbiased‚Äù source.

Trump, by the very nature of being president, is in fact a Primary Source.   His word is documented and set norms &amp; policies. Including his daily lies. 

-------
 

Back to the main point in questioning your perspective &amp; logic.  

- You claim Media Pushes Lies makes them the enemy of the people, 
 - b/c they are expected to be ‚Äúimpartial and unbiased‚Äù source.  
 - of which I've pointed that the Supreme Court, FCC, &amp; Republican administration have made it legal for media to be partial &amp; biased. 

- You also Defend Trump pushing Lies by claiming he's isn't suppose to be ‚Äúimpartial and unbiased‚Äù source
- I've also pointed out, whether stating facts or lies, being president sets tone of relations, policies, norms, &amp; standards.  That being President is the Ultimate primary source.  Everything you say is documented &amp; changes our nation, for better or worse. 

Thus, If the media's bias makes them enemy of the People, does a President who intentfully lie make him an enemy of the people?"

"The bitrate has nothing to do with the loudness level of a song. All music videos in Apple Music and on the iTunes Store have an audio bitrate of 256kbps. The audio is mastered differently. Many artists/bands master their music video audio for people playing on speakers and/or for broadcast TV.

Unfortunately it isn‚Äôt up to Apple or anyone else how the audio for music videos is mastered. Youtube will sometimes, automatically, increase the gain of the audio track so the video can sound louder (also fuller and higher in quality) compared to the Apple Music version. Try the artist‚Äôs EVO channel (or VEVO or whatever it‚Äôs called) on Youtube."

"Tree(n) notation is a way of writing very very large number, like so large that we don't have enough atoms in universe to write them(not that anyone has the time if we did). 

Big Oh notation: O(h) is a way of describing how a numerical(which means number based approximation) solution to a problem improves as decrease the step size. 

Most computer problems are solved by taking a big problem and chopping it into many little versions that a computer can quickly solve then putting them together for the proper thing.

So basically the original post was saying even if we do prove P= NP its possible that the algorithm to actually solve it is such that each step increases the time to solve so much that is pointless.

If something was O(N^Tree(57)) going from step 1 to step 2 would take enough time that the universe would probably end before a computer was done calculating."

"IANAL....but I've run a looooooooot of contests on social media with prizes in the $100,000s. It was incumbent upon your employers to understand the rules of Yelp prior to getting this contest up. The rules you listed below are hilariously inadequate. The fact that they encouraged you all to help customers write a review tells me they have no clue what they're doing. The fact they they changed the rules in the middle of the contest makes cringe and pray they never run a public contest with actual stakes and big time legal consequences. 

I don't think you have much recourse given that this contest violated Yelp's TOS. Lawyers, correct me, if I were running an illegal contest, I don't think I'd be obligated to pay out if I was caught (unless contestants were giving me money to enter?). You're only recourse is to ask very politely and very nicely. Talk to someone you know who's a good negotiator to figure out what to say. Do not threaten to sue or that you're talking to a lawyer. Keep this at a professional and personal level, like, ""Hey hr friend, help me out here. We all busted our butts getting reviews and it was a lot of fun.

"*de facto* vs *de jure*, it‚Äôs an important distinction because it allows individual states to declare what official languages they recognize for business etc within the state. Declaring them official within the state means that people that speak the language are represented appropriately and have resources available in that language (court interpreters, patient advocates who can speak their language, and so on) in that state. Declaring English as the *official* federal language would make it much more difficult for non-English or English Second Language speakers to receive those resources than it already is."

Most people will only invite you to one of these auditions (hospiteeravonden) if you send them a detailed and descriptive email or pm, and you fit in the profile of the house.

"Glad you found the bug. 

Some random remarks:

In the code above, you unnecessarily save your Spawn Points multiple times in OnPostLogin (which gets executed for each connecting client), rather run it once in GameMode-&gt;BeginPlay.

Try to avoid casting (e.g. for your GameInstance, PlayerController etc.), use Blueprint Interfaces instead. This will greatly increase Actor independence (it can drastically influence loading times under certain circumstances), is more performant overall, and allows for much better modularity and class interchangeability (if you ever decide to use a different Controller for example, you will just need to implement the Interface there, and won't be forced to go back into each and every function call where you would have a cast).

Most importantly, straighten those lines ;)"

"It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air in terms of character progression. While it may be easier to get 5*s in FEH, they are not as necessary. Upgrading your characters in FEH means more pulling. FEH revolves around pulling more characters. Bonus units, BST, new skills, etc. 
Dragalia allows you to upgrade your champions through: dragons, dragon bonds, your castle buildings, weapons (which are outside the gacha system), character levels, characters‚Äô mana circles, and wyrmprints. You are able to power up characters in a multitude of ways, thus 5*s are not necessary, albeit feel super exciting to get. 4*s are among the most powerful units in the game, and can clear all content thus far, maybe minus the super dragon boss most people haven‚Äôt reached. 
In this game personal skill level makes more of a difference as you can dodge almost all abilities, and you can time your special moves to make your party immune. There are different roles to be filled with healers, support type characters, and pure dps. There are tanks, and a few are very effective, but I personally don‚Äôt know how they fit into the grand scheme of things, although one of the best characters (top 3 probably) is a tank. 

I‚Äôm pretty burned out from FEH, as not pulling the units you want prevents me from progressing in the one place I can. Arena. Dragalia I feel like each event I need to make a new team. But the game is new, so only time will tell how it is after a year. 
If you consider playing it I would urge you to reroll for 2-3 5*s minimum. "

"More time to hit legend and their terrible new system of dropping you back down changed.

I like playing both formats and I like playing other games. It makes it rough to try to ladder up, so I accept I will fail some.

But they made that change to droping you four ranks of five stars each which means I am slogging back up from 21-16ish in both formats every month and it just feels pointless, especially wanting to try out new decks. I had to start at those ranks anyway before but now there are tons of stars to get through.

"You decide how many calories to eat by ""calculating your macros"".

To lose weight, you must eat less food calories than your body really needs, which forces your body to burn up stored body fat.  The reduced calories is called a calorie deficit, you'll see it mentioned below.

Here are the instructions, plus some other good beginner info.

Post the macros you get to see if you did it right.

**Use this macro calculator** (https://keto-calculator.ankerl.com) to determine your macro guidelines for fat, protein, carbs, and calories. 

In the calculator above, enter your ‚Äústats‚Äù -- **gender, height, weight and birth date**.

For Basic Metabolic Rate, click on the circle in front of **""Sedentary""** even if you exercise.  Most calculators exaggerate how many calories we burn with exercise, so better to not depend on burning calories via exercise when calculating your macros.

For **% Body Fat**, look for the **sentence that says ‚ÄùBased on your height and weight, your body fat percentage might be around ##%.‚Äù and use the ## number they recommended for you**. (Alternately, choose the link to Comparison Pictures to see the one that looks your size, and use the ##% on that picture's label.)

For **carbs**, use **20g**

For **protein**, look for the **sentence that says: ""When in doubt, choose the middle ground. For you, that's ##g"" and use the ## number they recommend for you**. (it‚Äôs usually right under the advertisement)

**For fat, enter 20% deficit to represent how much you plan to limit your calories** every day, and then it will display how much fat and how many calories to eat daily. (If your starting weight is 350 lbs or more, maybe use 25% or 30% deficit, because you have a lot of stored body fat to burn for energy so you need less energy from the food you eat.  Experiment with different percents to see what calorie recommendations you get, choose the one that you believe you could follow). (If you‚Äôre doing keto for non-weight-loss purposes, enter 0% deficit to maintain your current weight.)

Everyone is different, but frequently a calculator ends up recommending for women weight loss a calorie limit of 1200 to 1500 calories, for men weight loss a calorie limit of 1500 to 1800 calories.  If you‚Äôre far from that, then you either have special circumstances or maybe try the calculator again.

Your ‚ÄúPersonal Results‚Äù at the bottom summarizes your macro guidelines in grams for carbs, protein, fat and calories.  Notice that the data also indicates **the ratio percentages of calories** but this is the last time that you'll ever need to think about those percentages.  From here forward, it's all about **grams, grams, grams.**

**Use a food tracker** (I use Food Diary in MyFitnessPal; Cronometer and CarbManager are also popular) to enter your food every day. In fact, one can enter food for future days, so I enter my food for the following day or the next two or three days, which turns the food tracker into ‚Äúa meal plan to follow‚Äù instead of just ""the food I already ate"". That way I plan ahead to eat all the correct amounts of fat, protein, carbs and calories.

**After you know your macro guidelines, also keep the following in mind:**

the carb guideline is a LIMIT. Don't eat more than your limit, and it's always okay to eat less.

the fat guideline is a LIMIT. Don't eat more than your limit, and it's always okay to eat less.

the protein guideline is a REQUIREMENT, that's where your nutrition comes from. Always eat your daily protein guideline, plus it's okay to eat a little extra protein.

the calorie guideline (if you expect to lose weight) is a LIMIT.  Don‚Äôt eat more than your limit, and it‚Äôs always okay to eat less. Certainly, you might eat too many calories once in a while, but over the long-term you must count or control or limit your calories to lose weight.  This is the calorie counting or portion-size control or intermittent fasting part of the plan.

**If you have a weight loss goal, then you'll also control your calories i.e. limit your calories. You‚Äôll either count the calories, or you‚Äôll control calories without counting by depending on the ability of fat and protein to make you feel full before you overeat and to make you feel not hungry.**  Let‚Äôs say for example that your calorie goal is 1200 calories. On a keto way of eating, most of those calories will be protein and fat, and very little carbs. Even though fat is included, you still lose weight because you‚Äôre controlling or limiting the calories over all by counting, or by controlling portion-size, or sometimes by intermittent fasting.

**For a beginner, I suggest eating ordinary keto foods** such as eggs, beef, chicken, bacon, tuna, cheese, broccoli, avocado, butter, sour cream, cream cheese, olive oil.  Lettuce or spinach salads with meat, cheese, low-carb veggies and a delicious high-fat salad dressing. Low-carb veggies with butter, salt and pepper.

Keto without tracking and without counting calories is referred to as **lazy keto method** and many r/keto folks use that successfully, either for weight loss or for general health benefits and weight maintenance. However, the one thing they do count every day is net carbs. 

They are paying attention to portion size, or they are depending on the ability of fat and protein to make them feel full before they overeat, and make them feel not hungry. Thus they control their calories without counting them. Again, the one thing they do count every day is net carbs.

Some people who follow keto way of eating for weight loss learn that they're not able to successfully control / limit their overall calories without tracking, therefore they choose **tracking keto method** to measure, weigh and count all macros (carbs and protein and fat) and also count calories to meet their macro guidelines and calories goal for weight loss.

If you live in a place where it's legal, 5-MeO-DMT may be an option, though that's very different from DMT as well."

"With vaping you can't expect to lower nicotine levels fast for everyone, your body has a want for a chemical and you have to slowly come down off of it. Poor example to be related to but consider people trying to quit heroin they take pills that are slowly lowered in dosing to allow the body to naturally lessen desire and need for quantity some times dosing goes back up because body isn't ready for change. You could give vaping another try just don't treat it like a nicotine patch or gum because it's not meant to ween you off you have to do that by choice. I started smoking cigarettes when I was 15 I quit when I was 24 i was able to do it because that's what I wanted I'd even tried vaping to quit before but found myself in a similar situation, I have been vaping for a year now I chose to continue vaping because I personally like nicotine and just wanted to cut out all the extra crap cigarette companies added in. That's just my feelings on it were all different individuals so what works isn't always the same."

"Her loss.

It could be very satisfying to one day tell her yours are reps and you saved thousands of dollars on it yet she can't tell the difference. Maybe a good way to reality check someone if they ever do or say something elitist towards you.

In no way am I implying I disagree with your choice not to tell her and probably would do the same. I do love telling people proudly how I got my bags when they ask because I think if they have to and want to ask, they think they're likely real or hope it's a rep. 

I think the type of person to call someone out negatively on owning a rep is more likely to be a shady prick and do it behind your back. And out of the dozen times it's happened, the person has been glad I said rep and didn't feed the clasist overlords but since they hadn't told me their stance on it I was assuming they either feel the same as I or undecided. I hate confrontation so I probably wouldn't stay on the topic if it was otherwise with a stranger I don't care to or believe I even can change their view."
1/82 is included in the Food Department Manager jobcode along with the Frozen DM and Dairy DM. 
"If we assume that a person isn‚Äôt a complete idiot, and will choose previously-worn clothes that they know won‚Äôt chafe, then the likelihood of chafing in those clothes is zero. If they wear something new, the likelihood of chafing is non-zero. Therefore you are demonstrably more likely to chafe if you wear something new on race day. 

This should be obvious to anyone who isn‚Äôt a moron. If you historically almost never chafe, then sure, the risk might be really small. I for one have gotten like two blisters in my entire life, so the risk of wearing new shoes on race day is really small and not really something I worry about. 

Even so there‚Äôs really no way around the fact that the shoes I already have, I know for sure don‚Äôt give me blisters. The theoretical new shoes might have a 2% chance of blisters, which is really low, but 2%&gt;0%.

This logic can be applied to everyone, and everyone‚Äôs sensitivity to certain issues is different. Just because one or more of these things isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù for you doesn‚Äôt mean that none of them are high risk for anyone. Again, that should be obvious. "

"\#1 Lindsay - love the matchup and has been consistently scoring double digits, even better if Royce sits

\#2 Kerryon - has produced with high volume over carries recently and I see no reason why the Lions would go away from him now

\#3 CMC - Panthers will find a way to get their biggest stud the ball, and I would be hesitant to start Ingram over him until Ingram proves that he's as good as he was last year"

"Unfortunately mine is bad. I will start saying that sleep is something that i need more than food or anything else. If i don't sleep, i literally go immediately full on crazy.
So, I have this problem where a part of my jaw sometimes gets REALLY inflamed (a little part between the jaw and thr skull). So when that happens my jaw basically rubs onto my skull and IT HURTS. IT FRIGGIN HURTS.
This constant rubbing on the bone makes my head hurt, all my teeth hurt, neck and arm as well, so basically it's constant incredible pain.
Thing is, pain killers don't really work on this aaand it's a temporary problem that wears off on itself in a couple of weeks, but those few weeks you like in hell.
You can't eat warm food, you can't chew and you can't talk without doubling the amount of pain you're already in.
You know when one tooth gives you pain ? Imagine ALL the nerves of your teeth hurting at the same time.
The first time it happened i was a mess.
I didn't sleep for the first 30 hrs or so, then basically started micronapping, but never really slept (not even one hours straight) for two weeks.
Almost at the end of it i was so tired and so desperate and literally on the verge of a mental breakdown . Terrible experience all around, so of course it happens every now and then when i'm particularly stressed (because while i don't grind my teeth while i sleep, if I'm stressed i clench my jaw REAL shut tight, and that starts the whole thing).
Living on micronaps of minutes for weeks is HELL.
Literally drives you (and especially me) to madness real fast. "

"Guns have two different kinds of suppressors. Flash suppressors and sound suppressors which are called silencers. The guy who invented the muffler (car silencer he called them) also made and patented the gun silencer. 

Think of sound being a bouncy ball. If you just full force throw the ball at a wall, it bounces back, hard. That‚Äôs what sound coming from the explosion in a gun is doing. Now, ever thrown the ball in a small room or box? It bounces around until it just eventually stops. Chambers on a silencer do the same thing. They make the sound bounce around until it‚Äôs at a much lower level outside the silencer. Same exact way a muffler on your car works. "

"&gt;They haven't struggled in the pac 12. They have one conference loss and it was to a ranked team.

* Arizona State (3-4) 27-20
* UCLA (2-5) 31-24

Are you looking at the schedule?... They're far from performing relatively near Bama against similarly talented opponents.

It's great they have one conference loss but they also lost to an Auburn that's 2-3 in the SEC West, which is Alabama's division. That's not really great foreshadowing there nor is there anyway to confidently make that absolute statement (They'd be undefeated).

"Key word is percentage.

He is also on pace to rush for under 200 attempts. It's easier for a higher percentage of his attempts to come in those situations when he is rushing for a lower number of carries.

I would assume that means it is also a bit of lazy playcalling and teams just generally have a good idea of when we run the ball.

A bit of creativity really helps an offense like this. I think either way (stacking the run and still not getting good looks down field/teams knowing when we are running/passing and clamping intermediate) there needs to be some diversification of play calling."

Then do the same with Y.

Some people learn by muscle memory of how you move your arm across the page.

It really depends on how you associate the two directions in your brain.  maybe its east/west and north/south.  Maybe its the color red vs the color blue.  Maybe its mexican food vs italian.

"I don't really enjoy strip clubs with groups of guys, but I do occasionally go by myself. I've read some of the other replies here and they make sense (not attractive, hard to meet girls, want girls to want to talk to you, seeing boobs is great, etc). For me it's a little different. I've never had issues getting attractive women, though I will say when single it's always been A LOT of work which gets tiring. Even now, when I'm in a relationship, I go because sometimes I just want to sit there and relax and it be ok to completely objectify a woman who is ok with me doing that (because I don't think this is ok in really any other circumstance). To just enjoy what she is doing and not have to work to see it. Anyone in a long-term relationship will tell you that relationships are work, and that includes intimacy and sex. In a healthy relationship men don't get to demand women fuck them on a dime (or at least they shouldn't be, this obviously happens). Hell, I don't always want to drop what I'm doing and have sex when it's turned around on me.  Sometimes you just want to not think about any of the ""work"" that goes into this stuff and just pay someone to give you exactly what you want (I can see why some men might hire escorts for example). Oh and, just to clarify, my significant other doesn't care that I go to strip clubs occasionally. 

Also, for whatever reason, I really enjoy talking to the strippers. I've had a lot of hilarious/awesome conversations at strip clubs where she just sat on my lap and talked to me for an hour and didn't even charge me for the time (though I of course still bought multiple dances and closed out the evening with her tits in my face). It's almost therapeutic because you can basically say anything you want with zero judgement. I've heard of men paying for an escorts time to simply talk as well, probably for a similar reason.

I haven't taken any up on this, but for any of you guys who have the fantasy of getting a strippers number, this ""method"" seems to do the trick every now and then (again, not my goal). I've gotten a half dozen strippers numbers over the years (when I'm drunk it seems like a great idea) and it's always been the ones who I ended up talking to half the night, treated like a normal person, etc. I guess for obvious reasons. One or two of them were not even hitting me up for escorting, but to actually go to dinner. Not my thing though!

I also have it in my right shoulder upper arm and for appts or anything out of the house I found that dry fit material(under armour preferably but Nike works too) is by far the best feeling because of the light weight and non constricting nature of the fibers. At home I typically never wear a shirt but when I have company or go out for a cigarette I just put my good arm through a loose fitting hoodie and drape the other side around my bad shoulder(so the affected arm is not in the sleeve) thus not being constricted in any way. Hope this helps good luck mate

If either of these missionaries had a shelf, very possible, Jeff loaded it up just a little more. I would have liked to ask more questions but my spouse is TBM and I didn't want to push it. I got a good enough sense of how they felt form what they shared. The comment of the other two missions being the ones who need the ass chewing helped to justify Jeff's behavior. In time it would be interesting to see what they think of the experience. 

I really hope Jeff continues his mission tours and does the same where ever he goes. Keep it up Jeff.

"1. Story ramps up at the end of Chapter 3, then slows down for most of 4 and 5. From late Chapter 6 onward, the story really takes off. I didn't do sidequests after Chapter 6, too invested.

2. Most of the core mechanics are explained by the end of Chapter 3. But as you acquire more blades and party members, there are additions to combat capabilities as late as Chapter 8. Take some time to read whenever new mechanics get introduced. Combat becomes ""fun"" when you can smoothly progress through Driver and Blade combos and manage your switching and Chain Attacks for big damage. Since you are just starting out, I'll also recommend to not really go off exploring until you have a 3-person party - the game is balanced around this and lots of new players end up hitting a wall because of it. 

3. Side quests, just pick up most of what you find in the main areas. There's a lot to do. Do try to check if you can make progress on Driver and Blade Affinity charts regularly. Goes a long way towards making combat smoother.

4. A chapter will run you about 2-5 hours or more depending on how much you focus on the story or go off doing your own thing in between. The later chapters are shorter.

5. Answered by others, so enjoy your choice!"

"The links in your comment don't support what the quote says. The PLOS one study doesn't say that suicide rates rose 20 times after reassignment surgery. Saying it like that implies the person who had the surgery became more suicidal after they had it. They study actually says that post-op trans people have a higher suicide rate than the general population. They don't conclude that SRS isn't effective.

&gt;Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, **although alleviating gender dysphoria**, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.

So they're saying that while SRS is helpful, it may not be good enough to be the only treatment.

I had to dig around to find what the Guardian was referring to since they didn't provide a source. All I could find was [this brief summary](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-mds/haps/projects/ARIF/completed-requests.pdf). Ctrl+F gender to find the bit. The review is from 2004. The link says of it's most pertinent sources, the most recent one is from 1996 with many from the 80's. A lot has changed since then. I can't check the accuracy of everything your quoted text says because I can't find the review, but again, they're not saying that SRS isn't effective, nor are they saying that we don't know if it's effective or not.

&gt;Both reviews while recognising net benefits to carefully selected individuals remained concerned about
the quality of evidence on effectiveness (particularly adverse outcomes) and the biases to which
available studies were open.

So the review says that SRS can be an effective treatment. It's just that they think we can't say with any certainty how effective it is without more and better studies."

"Yeah expecting Argonians to win a pitched battle against a standing Imperial army or an advanced crazy magic Dunmer army is literally like expecting an army of native Americans to win a battle against a Roman legion or a medieval European army. I mean sure there have been some cases of Argonians holding their own but for most of their modern history they've been made of varied disparate and independent tribes. Reverence of Sithis is deep in their culture, and to them Sithis is change - everything changes, nothing lasts so why try to get in the way of that? That's why they don't build pyramids and great stone structures anymore, in the grandness of time those cities will fall, the stone will crumble and the residents will rot - so it's better for them to live simple, impermanent lives as close to the Hist as possible. It's literally a move from the Ancient Argonians worshipping a Sithis of edgy, destroy-everything emo nihilism to modern Argonians worshipping a Sithis of change and cheerful nihilism.

"I ran into this issue as well. 

In my case I couldn‚Äôt adjust the y-axis limit switch far enough forward after adding the stepper dampener. Since it is the X plate that interferes with the stepper bracket, I‚Äôm not entirely sure why adding the dampeners caused the problem (neither of the interfering parts were moved and it worked fine before).

Regardless, Printing a new bracket seemed the obvious solution, but since I only have one printer I had a chicken and egg problem. My (probably obvious) solution was to remove one screw from the limit switch, shift it forward so the back hole on the switch aligns with the front hole on the rail, and temporarily reattach with just one screw.

"Clonazepam is very physically addictive, or causes great dependency. If your honest with yourself, and your doctor, that you won‚Äôt abuse, not saying you do, then you should be fine as long as you use the drug sparingly and definitely not every night. Though that is easier said than done especially if you suffer anxiety or insomnia because the relief alone is addicting, not so much ‚Äúthe high‚Äù.

I wouldn‚Äôt call him reckless unless you have had problems in the past with drugs or alcohol. Millions of people use it with, more or less, no problems if used short term, like 2 to 4 weeks.

Me personally, I would rather suffer stress or insomnia all day everyday then fall down that hole again, as dependence is literal torture. Though, I might take lorazepam about three nights a month. Use it as a last resort because it can be a awesome tool, but a dangerous one. I think klonopin is too strong for everyday sleep though and prefer Ativan because it seems weaker.

Scary enough is the fact in can cause long term brain deficits, though not proven per se, definitely seem to exist."

"&gt; No, the boxing out player is initiating contact by slowing down (see: taking an unavoidable position). By the literal rules, that's a foul. That was my point.

That's incorrect, and illogical. If I stop out of a sprint, and you're trailing me, you're crashing into me, and you are initiating contact. It is your responsibility to avoid the contact, and you do not have a carte blanche to keep running.

&gt;Blocking Fouls:
When the disc is in the air a player may not move in a manner solely to prevent an opponent from taking an unoccupied path to the disc

&gt;Solely. The intent of the player‚Äôs movement can be partly motivated to prevent an opponent from taking an unoccupied path to the disc, so long as it is part of a general effort to make a play on the disc. **Note, if a trailing player runs into a player in front of him, it is nearly always a foul on the trailing player.**

&gt;Bumping shoulders is an offsetting foul every time if we're being literal, which is also my point.

Only if it affects play, i.e. is non-incidental.

See under receiving fouls

&gt;Some amount of incidental contact before, during, or immediately after the attempt often is unavoidable and is not a foul.

and 2 under Fouls

&gt;Contact resulting from adjacent opposing players simultaneously vying for the same unoccupied position, is not in itself a foul.

Concerning the travel, I'm not sure if USAU has this, and if they don't I reckon it'll be in the 12th edition... maybe

1.3.8 (WFDF)
&gt;Players should be mindful of the fact that they are acting as referees in any arbitration between teams. Players must only make a call where a breach is significant enough to make a difference to the outcome of the action.

Would be my reaction to the travel call if it came from my teammates.

Edit: I just want to add, I'm not purposefully misconstruing your arguments and am sorry we are having a misunderstanding. It seems like quite often you are writing ""non-incidental"" but don't mean non-incidental, but rather non-intentional, non-severe or insignificant. Example below:

&gt;The operative clause 'a player contacts an opponent' defines what a foul is, and if we're literal about all non-incidental contact being a foul then God help us.

In hindsight I'm not sure if you actually mean non-incidental contact, despite us having just clarified what incidental contact means in the post above it."

"This is not true, I‚Äôm a religious studies major chiming in. Nowhere in the Bible does it say Satan is a ‚Äúfallen angel‚Äù ‚Äî that idea came with Zoroastrian influence centuries after Christ died. 

Sin was created by God. In Job, we see that God asks ‚Äúwhere were you when I created the heavens‚Äù when Job asks why misfortune occurs. The answer is, it‚Äôs a part of God‚Äôs will and we have to deal with it. 

Philosophy would have us believe that God ‚Äúcreated sin‚Äù so we can appreciate that which is not sinful. Literally, if all was good, we wouldn‚Äôt know it. Sound familiar?

All was good at creation. Then, according to one of the two creation stories in Genesis (likely a collection of proto-Israelite poetry, not a factual account), humans gave birth to sin by eating from the tree of knowledge. The proto-Israelites were making the same argument that aforementioned philosophy states: because we *know* good from evil, evil exists.

"I'm pretty sure RelfexCheck's summary would be far better, but here are the cliff notes: 

The OG Beuwulf is the hero of the oldest piece of English literature, titled, appropriately, *Beowulf*. In the story, he comes from his homeland of Gaetland to Denmark, as the Danish king is plagued by Grendel, a mighty beast that cannot be harmed by any weapon. So, Beowulf beats the mofo with his bare hands. After it gets its arm torn off, the beast flees into the swamp, where it bleeds out from its wounds. Grendel's mom gets a tad angry at that, and begins hunting Beowulf and his men. The two end up fighting and, long story short, Beowulf lopes her head off. 

Many years later, Beowulf is the king of the Goets, and a dragon starts haunting his lands. Beowulf goes to fight it alone, but the third time ain't the charm and he ends up succumbing to his wounds (though he did kill the beast) - which in my experience does reflect his survival rate on the field once he's played (though the fact that he's Dragoncraft is kind of funny)."

Anyway, our gym got a platform and some bars not too long ago, as well as rubber plates and a thing you can insert bars into to do T-Bar rows. Pretty sweet for a commercial gym, so we'd like to take care of the stuff.

The Ohio Deadlift bar is a bar from a company called Rogue. It's 20 kg (as opposed to the typical 45 lbs), is a lot stiffer (no bend), and has really, really good knurling for you to get an awesome grip on it. 

When people use that bar for t bar rows and use a handheld attachment on it from the cables, it often grinds the hell out of the bar and ruins the knurling due to the metal on metal. People have also taken it to do squats and bench press with, which is a waste because it does nothing for you in those lifts but is also inconsiderate because other people might've wanted to use it for its actual purpose.

The Olympic bars are just bars with a lot more spin, perfect for stuff like cleans and other olympic lifts, but pointless and sometimes dangerous for other stuff. If you try to bench with it (which I often see people do), you'll notice it's really unstable as it's got way more spin than other normal bars. Makes it real easy to mess yourself up. They also have to be maintained a little, oiled every now and then and thoroughly cleaned up.

Just nice to take care of them, and use the generic old bars the gym had for stuff like T-bar rows or landmine presses or bench press and leave the specialty bars for their purpose. "

My thoughts exactly!
How about we ***RESCUE*** the poor thing?!
"Scottish and Northerners are disproportionally represented in New Who but you don't see people up in arms about that. Instead they are upset over race, I rather think it says a lot about the people arguing it. If you're upset about diversity in a show maybe you should complain about the lack of diversity in other shows too? It would only be fair. If this is the argument you are going to have, than at least be equally fair about it. 

You yourself said you didn't mind Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow, because unbelievably changing a character's race does not ruin the quality of the entertainment. Instead it allows for a reimagining of the show from a new angle. In Doctor Who it allows them to do a story like Rosa. 

Again, how can it be pandering if you didn't even *notice* until the third episode of the season? They didn't mention it. It's not a big deal, they simply *exist*. Which brings me back to my main frustration with arguments like this-shows do a lot of pandering, but the pandering people get upset about is race? What does that say about those people? 

It's blatant hypocrisy and it's hypocrisy brought about by people's biases. Let them do what they want, cast who they want and just enjoy the entertainment. It's long overdue anyway. "

How much?   The world population is approaching 8 billion, but there are maybe 100 A-list actors I can think of.

The point is, its not a great load star (pun intended) since the overwhelming majority of people that do everything precisely the same wouldn't have anywhere near the results (more likely to end up asking people if they'd like fries with that), especially if they don't start off in the right circle of friends (pun intended) in Hollywood, where its more about who knows who.     

By contrast you could look at a professional in other fields like medicine or engineering or aviation where if you put in the work, there's a good chance you can achieve the same and become a doctor or pilot or whatever just like them, something where there's say 15 million doctors versus the handful of A-list actors that are buying private islands and snorting mountains of cocaine with Johnny Depp."

"&gt;I don't know enough about? 

Recidivism. That's why your country has so much of it; apparently you don't even know what it means.

&gt;You are just saying that your OPINION on how we should treat criminals is better. 

Nope, I didn't even express any such opinion.

All I did is point out the objective statistical fact that America's retribution focused justice system results in more crime, more recidivism, more incarceration, more rapes, and more murder than that of the Nordic model nations and their rehabilitation focused justice system, even once differences in population and the like are accounted for. 

It's up to you to make the call on what conclusions should be drawn from that. 

&gt;It isn't like I will learn the terminology that you're referring to, then magically change my deeply rooted moral belief. 

If your deeply rooted moral beliefs prioritize the prevention of rape over the punishment of criminals, then that's *exactly* what it means. 

But if you value the punishment of criminals over the prevention of rapes, then you're absolutely right, I've got nothing to convince you with. 

&gt;If you feel comfortable letting mass murderers and rapists run free after you THINK they have been rehabilitated (you have no way to know for sure)

Sure I do; the fact that even my society up here in Canada has drastically lower recidivism rates than yours. "

"I'll unpack this sentence.

&gt;It is not the case the case that the proportionately large number of black kids that get harassed by police

There is a disproportionate number of black kids harassed by police, this is not because of the following:

&gt;simply because they all somehow look like adults.

Your assertion that many black children genuinely get misrepresented as adults

Therefore:  Black children are disproportionately harassed, but it is not because of your claim that black children get wrongly identified because they look like adults.

You can connect that with the first sentence of that post to get a better understanding of what I'm saying.

"I'm a junior cs major right now, and I actually really enjoy the program. I also wasn't too sure about this school and was planning on going to UB, but I got the best financial aid package here so there wasn't really a choice, but if I could go back in time I would still choose this one over UB. The general atmosphere around here is a lot nicer and more casual than what I got at UB, and there's so much to do here.

I also have to agree with the one comment here that says UB is too big. I've been there a few times and the campus is massive, it's really intimidating. Meanwhile Binghamton's campus is also pretty big, but you could still walk from one side to the other without worrying. Also, Buffalo's bus system is completely garbage, my aunt lives there so I've been there often enough to confirm. In Binghamton we have both the county buses and the school buses, and they're both free for students. 

City life might be a little dull, but I was never one for parties so I couldn't tell you. But Buffalo is a REALLY nice city, so there's no comparison in that respect, although you'd definitely need a car around there to get to the good places. Campus life in Binghamton is pretty nice though, so until you're someone who has to party every week you'll be fine here.

Sorry for the long comment, TLDR Binghamton is a good school and nice campus with pretty dull city life, Buffalo is a big campus with a lively city attached, but good luck getting anywhere without a car."

"One of my boys has done this since before I adopted him. The adoption center said it was a stress reaction, ""neurotic licker"" who had a nervous tic that caused him to groom all of his fur off of his tummy and legs. The vet said that seemed like that's what it was, saw no fleas, left it at that. New vet disagreed and said to keep an eye on him since we had just moved and stress very well could have been it. Over the past year, he's gotten much more outgoing, much more comfortable, and much more bald. The vet recommended a hypoallergenic diet, his initial thought the first visit was an allergy and a year of 0 progress strengthened that belief. We're switching him over with a sensitive stomach and skin formula then moving him over to a hydrolized protein food. About 6 weeks to see if there's any changes, but our new vet seems absolutely certain. Maybe ask yours if that could be a possibility as well? If it is a stress reaction, while researching how to help ""barbers"" I found some pretty solid tips. Biggest one is lots and lots of playtime. Keep them distracted, give them something to put their energy into, snack, then nap time. If you're sure of a certain roommate your cat may have a problem with, let them give the cat treats and food and take part in play time so they're associated with things your cat enjoys."
Old vet tech here :) This will be an unpopular answer but you are not the only person to express these problems in cats. Not all cats are like this of course but for whatever reason some are and any amount of training and stimulation doesn't help. You should never feel at risk or scared in your own home. You might have to get rid of her.  That being said I would recommend way more play time as kittens are very energetic. It could be that she is using you as a way to tire herself out. Good luck!

"I was running a group with a couple friends, and the mage‚Äôs backstory included his wife dying from sickness, then having father and son grow distant from each other, with the son becoming more and more hostile towards him.

I took this, then twisted a dagger into my friends heart.

The son (names Percy), grew angry at his father for not saving the mom (Mirabelle) from dying. So he started searching for ways to bring her back, and found the god of death and rot (a home brewed god called Varuna, also the campaign‚Äôs big bad guy). Percy then became a Death Cleric in the hopes of becoming powerful enough to resurrect his dead mother. His power was further boosted by him finding the hand and eye of Vecna. (A trap made by Varuna.)

As a test of loyalty, Varuna asks him to kill his father-and by extension, the party.

He does so, and because the combined might of the party is tougher than he is, Percy is forced to keep using the pieces of the lich Vecna, until Vecna rips Percy‚Äôs soul out of his body and assumes control of his body.

The party still beats him, and then destroy both the eye and hand, releasing Percy‚Äôs soul to the afterlife and allowing one last tearful goodbye between a father and son, as Percy goes to meet the divine punishment that he knows he has incurred."

"&gt;This is only true when you define ""what DayZ was supposed to be"" by the overly-ambitious bloated mess that DayZ snowballed into when Dean Hall decided they wanted to completely reinvent the wheel.

DayZ has been defined as a hardcore and unforgiving survival game by multiple developers. And the direction they were taking was pretty clear. What wasn't clear was, as you said, the feature creep and mismanagement.

The DayZ arma 2 mod still has tons of glitches that have been around since its inception. The modders can only do so much. I hate it when people give them way too much credit. Yes the fixed a lot but to use it as an example of the mod being able to be polished is just downright false. There are still tons of detrimental bugs and inherent limitations.

The business model for CS can't be compared to DayZ because... well why do I even have to explain this? Isn't it obvious? CS is a MUCH smaller and simpler game and not even close to the ambitiousness of DayZ. Of course THEY can afford to simply push out the source version faster than DayZ. It's a game where you spawn on a small map, and shoot the other team. Once you iron out the gunplay and netcode, what more is there to work on?

"One of the most fascinating spirit trends that I've witnessed in the past year or so has been the growing acceptance of unaged rum as something worthy of consideration on its own merits, rather than simply as something to chuck into a cocktail. All of a sudden, we all seem to have collectively discovered that sugarcane spirit doesn't necessarily need to be aged in oak to be sippable. Who could have known?

The Haitians, that's who. Well, among others, anyway. (Don't hate on me, Jamaica!)

Haiti, a former French colony situated on the western portion of the island of Hispaniola, has been a hub for sugarcane production in the Caribbean since the 17th century. Today, there exists only one ""big"" rhum distillery in the entire nation - Barbancourt - but a tradition of small-scale distillation lives on in the hundreds of Haitian clairin distillers that dot the countryside. Unlike Barbancourt - who, don't get me wrong, do produce some pretty tasty bottlings - clairin distilleries are usually small-scale operations, often no more than a shack in the middle of a cane field. And their product never, ever touches a barrel. Ever.

As a cane juice rhum variant, clairin is superficially similar to the agricoles produced in nearby Martinique and Guadeloupe. However, aside from the production scale, there are three main differences between the two styles. The first lies in the fact that clairin distillers harvest local heirloom varieties of sugarcane. These varietals grant each distillate a unique character, similar to how, say, different apple cultivars might alter the profile of a hard cider. The second is that clairin distillers use custom-built pot stills rather than column stills in their rhum production. And thirdly, clairin is completely wild-fermented, making use of the natural yeasts present in the juiced sugarcane. Wild yeasts, and the long fermentation times required to cultivate them, impart complex and often wacky flavors to rhum, which is part of the reason why these bottles have a bit of a cavalier reputation in the rumverse.

Perhaps because of the style's eccentricities, most clairin is consumed locally. However, in recent years, a handful of bottlings have made it to European and American shores thanks to none other than Velier's Luca Gargano. A few years ago, Gargano set about the Haitian countryside to sample as many clairins as possible. In the process, and amidst much paint thinner-quality swill - this is the equivalent of moonshine that we're talking about, after all - he found four distillers cranking out a truly exceptional product. Three of those were subsequently sourced and bottled for the American market. (The fourth, Le Rocher, has yet to make it over here for some reason.) 

Please note, by the way, that these reviews are for the 2016 batches sourced from Astor Wines in New York. The 2018 batches from K&amp;L will vary in proof, and possibly slightly in tasting notes as well, due to the nature of annual sugarcane harvests and wild-yeast fermentation.

The first of these releases is the brainchild of Michel Sajous of the Chelo Distillery north of Port-Au-Prince. To produce his clairin, Michel harvests Cristalline cane directly from his small farm. Interestingly, in a step that would make any Martinique distiller gasp in horror, he presses the cane shortly after harvest and then boils the fresh-pressed juice down to a syrup. The reason for this unusual step is that the syrup can be stored away, allowing him to produce clairin throughout the year rather than only at harvest time.

**Clairin Sajous - 54.3% ABV - $40**

**NOSE:** Cane juice, green olives in brine, dirty feet, half-sour pickles, green banana, rice vinegar, papaya, stewed tomatoes, chicken broth, celery seed.

Welcome to the most savory of the trio. You'd think from reading all of those bizarre notes that this stuff would nose like an awful savory-sweet mess, but it actually works in a pretty cohesive and pleasant way.

**TASTE:** Sugar-water, gherkins, sweet fennel, underripe banana, celery, canrdamom pods, Moroccan black olives, papaya, oregano, Golden Delicious apple.

Again, what should by all rights be a cacophony turns out to be sort of an out-of-left-field symphony. The predominant notes are mostly savory, but there's more than enough of a sweet undercurrent to make it a nice little sipper.

**FINISH:** Medium-short. Cardamom pods, cane juice, green olives in brine, papaya, underripe banana, agave nectar, half-sour pickles, tomato sauce, sweet basil, wet stone.

Yup - tomato sauce. It's Italy by way of Haiti. But in a good way! I swear! Hey, where are you going...?

**IF THIS WERE AN SMWS BOTTLING: ""Moroccan Deli Counter""**


The next stop in our journey takes us to the village of Cavaillon, where Fritz Vaval operates the Arawaks distillery amidst twenty hectares of Madame Meuze cane. Fritz presses and wild-ferments his harvest on-site and double-distills it on a MacGuyveresque continuous still, which features leather trays and a gas-can condenser. 

**Clairin Vaval - 48.8% ABV - $40**

**NOSE:** Cane juice, sweet fennel, oregano, banana chips, star anise, watermelon, lavender, guava, passionfruit, wet wood, tarragon.

It needs to be stated here just how pure and potent that fennel/star anise note is throughout the entire experience. Here it's backed by some tasty fruit and floral notes, as well as that deep but slightly odd ""wet wood"" aroma.

**TASTE:** Cane juice, star anise, cantaloupe, wet musty wood, sweet fennel, fried plantains, red grapefruit, herbes de Provence, lavender candy.

The palate on the Vaval is rich and deep, dominated by pleasant anise (I'm usually not a fan of anise and I love it) and backed by sweet fresh fruit and that almost mezcal-like woody note. 

**FINISH:** Average length. Sweet fennel, star anise, wet musty wood, fresh strawberry, watermelon, lavender candy, cinnamon stick, cane syrup, orange zest, wet stone.

The longest finish of the three, and arguably the best overall. Citrus and strawberry pop out of absolutely nowhere, and the dominant notes from the palate get a nice reprise. 

**IF THIS WERE AN SMWS BOTTLING: ""Melon and Anise Salad""**


Finally, we come to the product of Faubert Casimir's distillery in the village of Baraderes. Faubert grows and processes Hawaii White and Red sugarcane, which grows alongside banana and lime trees in a fifty hectare field. While the pressed juice is fermenting in the distillery's mango-wood tanks, he infuses it with cinnamon and other botanicals in order to add complexity to the final product. (This addition, unusual as it may sound, is apparently fairly typical for the region.)

Tragically, this bottle was recently pulled from US markets due to an abnormally high lead content. It's safe to drink, but might be dangerous for pregnant women. You know, aside from the whole ""alcoholic beverage"" thing.

**Clairin Casimir - 48.3% ABV - $40**

**NOSE:** Ripe bananas, sourdough bread, fresh coconut meat, olives in brine, half-sour pickles, sweet fennel, tart cherry, preserved lemon, cane juice, curry leaf.

The Casimir possesses the most muted nose of the three. Unlike the other two, and despite the botanicals, it actually comes across as a fairly typical (but pleasant) agricole blanc from Martinique or Guadeloupe.

**TASTE:** Ripe bananas, olives in brine, tart cherry, preserved lemon, nata de coco, strawberry candy, rice vinegar, sweet fennel, cardamom, sourdough, cane juice.

So many bananas! Bananas and olives, actually, as unusual as that may sound to someone who's not familiar with agricoles. Again, all of these notes are fairly typical ""cane-juice rhum"" fare, but they're presented with grace and elegance here.

**FINISH:** Medium-short. Tart cherry, ripe banana, brine, sourdough bread, nutmeg, sweet basil, fennel bulb, nata de coco, cane juice, sweet bell pepper, strawberry candy.

Surprisingly gentle for a finish, considering these bottles' collective reputation. Mostly sweet-tart fruits and cane with flourishes of savory.

**IF THIS WERE AN SMWS BOTTLING: ""Banana-Olive Daiquiri""**

**VERDICT:** Tasting these three unaged rhums side-by-side is a fascinating experience because it shows just how different they all are. The Casimir doesn't stray too far from the reservation, expressing some tasty tropical fruit and olive notes. The Vaval, by contrast, is strong, punchy and sharp in the best way possible. And the Sajous is the ""wild card"" of the bunch, expressing a slew of savory and sweet notes that somehow come together into a jangly but cohesive whole. If I had to rank them, I'd place the Vaval first, the Sajous close behind, and the Casimir a distant third, but I'm happy to have them all on my shelf.

More than anything, though, I'm just grateful that artisanal producers like Fritz, Faubert and Michel still exist out there in the world. Through their product, all three of these distillers have proven that they deserve to be talked about in the same breath as Seale, Spence and the other big names in the rum world. Long may they continue their good work."

"&gt;But then I got Habitats in 2230

You really can't get habitats that early in 2.2. The main limiting factor is the Star Fortress technology, which is the only prerequisite for the Voidborn perk. Getting enough engineering research for it is doable, but the hardest part is getting the technology card to show up in the first place.

If the year is less than 2250, the Star Fortress card has a 0.1x modifier. That means a normally weight 60 card is now weight 6. Add on to that you need 6 other tier 2 engineering tecs for it to even have a chance to show up in the first place, you usually can only get habitats after year 2250.

There are two tricks that speed this up a little. One is to be bordering a fallen empire to get a 10x modifier to the card's weight. The other is to build 3 starholds to get a x5 modifier. That's still only weight 30 (37.5 with a voidcraft researcher). When you're rolling against many other weight 80 and 100 cards, you either need a fallen empire neighbor, or have to pray to the gods of RNG.

After aaaall that, you still need 5 whole years to build it."

But when I had balance tests as a kid, they couldn't find anything wrong, and when I randomly somehow magically injured my first joint in my early 20s, the GP said I was too young to have anything wrong with me.

"Sure!

If you're into similarly contained stories (i.e. graphic novels/limited series), I'd for *sure* check out Roughneck and Secret Path (which has an accompanying soundtrack by the late Gord Downie of the Tragically Hip).

The highest recommendations you'll probably get are his Sweet Tooth series (like 60 issues or so) and Essex County, which is considered by many to be his magnum opus.

Trillium and Descender are more sci-fi (Descender being an ongoing), if that's more your cup of tea. He has some other GNs, such as Lost Dogs (his first!) and The Nobody, but they aren't quite as strong as the others - though I'm a huge Lemire stan so I have them all haha

&gt;**Abstract** On October 19, 2017 the Pan-STARRS1 telescope discovered a rapidly moving object. By October 30, its orbital eccentricity was determined to be 1.196¬±0.006 making this the first detection of an interstellar object. Designated 1I/2017 U1 (‚ÄòOumuamua), it passed perihelion on September 9, 2017 and made its Earth close approach at 63 lunar distances on October 14. Because it was receding rapidly from the Earth and Sun, within a week of discovery the brightness dropped by a factor of 10 and in less than a month it had dropped by a factor of 100 so there was only a short period available for characterization. Deep images of ‚ÄòOumuamua showed no cometary activity, with limits on the amount of micron-sized dust at &lt; 1 kg (within 750 km) that could be present. The light curve showed an instantaneous rotation period of 7.34 hours with a brightness range of 2.5 magnitudes, implying an extremely elongated axis ratio of ~10:1. Assuming a low albedo typical of comets (4%) the estimated dimensions were 800x80x80 m. However, as more time series data were obtained, it was evident that ‚ÄòOumuamua was in an excited spin state with the long axis precessing around the total angular momentum vector with an average period of 8.67¬±0.34 h. The timescale for damping an excited spin in a body this size is very long, so the spin state may reflect the violent process of ejection of ‚ÄòOumuamua from its host planetary system. ‚ÄòOumuamua‚Äôs surface reflectivity was red with a spectral slope of 23%¬±3% per 100 nm, consistent with comet surfaces, the dark side of Iapetus, and other minerals. Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based data were combined for a detailed study of the orbit. Our analysis of 207 astrometric positions showed that the orbit could not be fit by a gravity-only trajectory, but could be fit (at the 30-sigma level) with the addition of a radial non-gravitational acceleration. We explored several explanations for the non-gravitational motion, and found that cometary outgassing is the most physically plausible, but requires that ‚ÄòOumuamua has a somewhat different nature from solar system comets. Support for this work was obtained from NSF grants AST-1617015 and AST-1413736. "
"I hadn't heard of the nirvana fallacy before, so thanks for putting that on my radar.

However what I said in regards to the political parties is not a nirvana fallacy, it's a metaphor. And the bit about being liberal and owning guns is a bad joke not a nirvana fallacy as again there's no solution or comparative of solutions offered. The pivotal element of a nirvana fallacy is to attack a competing idea by presenting a solution, or promoting an unrealistic or idealized solution all at the expense of a realistic solution. I present no solution of any kind and merely an observation exhibited by something which showcases my distaste for the environment in which we currently reside politically. So while I appreciate the TIL on nirvana fallacy, it's not used correctly here."

"500M won't happen - Ngalinn round trip as around 3m with bonuses if I'm lucky and get full roster of missions. That happens, but not all the time; I think 2m round trip as around average. So, i think 100M is tops through the King - maybe even less if i opt for max Reputation over money. Going for 20-30M passenger missions sounds more like a way to reach 500M

What would King rank give me, besides the name. Ie, when people grind for something - they expect some kind of return. At this point, I already unlocked all of Imperial ships. If there is another, faster way to grind money - why stick around just for the rank itself?"

"But the businesses themselves should be the ones to decide whether or not to allow it in their place of work. I think they should be separate issues, because whether or not it *affects* others, what does it have to do with offshore drilling? Zip-doodly-shit.

If it shouldn't be allowed indoors (blanket statement), what about vape shops? Should they have ionizers/fans/air purifiers like a pipe or cigar lounge? The employees and the customers make the choice to work and shop there, but if it isn't something we should permit, shouldn't there be regulations for the safety of the clientele?

Where I live, some places restrict people from carrying firearms (concealed or open), but it's not a complete ban, because some businesses are okay with their customers and/or employees carrying while on the premises. Vaping indoors should similarly be at the discretion of the business owner and property owner, not necessarily the state or county.

"I'm going to interpret the question a little differently because without stat squish and aggro, any modern character would just annihilate vanilla characters. Let's say you're against a 40 man vanilla raid group with vanilla abilities and talents, but you are a level 63+ boss with level 120 abilities and talents. So you don't just 1 shot things because you are appropriately damage-tuned for a vanilla raid.

40 man vanilla raid vs Arms warrior boss:

* The boss's main abilities are colossus smash, overpower, sharpen blade, and mortal strike. If multiple of these abilities lines up at the same time on 1 tank, that tank needs defensive cds or there has to be a tank swap.

* Periodically the boss uses sweeping strikes to hit a tank + melee dps simultaneously. Melee dps need to rotate soaking the sweeping strikes hits with abilities like evasion. The offtank can't be targeted by sweeping strikes and if there are no other melee in range, it just kills the maintank.

* Periodically the boss uses heroic leap + bladestorm on the ranged/healers. Those players need to be pre-spread and then GTFO fast or the damage from bladestorm and deep wounds will be too much to heal through

* Boss randomly uses raidwide AOE fear. Forsaken OP vanilla race.

* If the boss detects a player under 35% HP, the boss will charge and execute spam that target. Probably just outright kills any non-tank so the whole raid has to maintain high hp.

* The boss summons a pocket healer when he gets to 20% HP. If the raid is horde, the pocket healer is a paladin, and if the raid is alliance, the pocket healer is a shaman. The pocket healer has to be cc'd and killed before it casts heals/blessings/totems. If the paladin stays alive long enough, the boss gets lay on hands. If the shaman stays alive long enough, the boss gets bloodlust and windfury.

That's probably more mechanics than almost every vanilla raid boss and it would be mechanically really difficult for players at the time. I think it would be pretty fun though."

"As with most other comments here... ""whips"" can be an effective tool if used correctly but can also be misused.  (the same can be said with a standard leash and collar for a dog). Here are times I've used one:
1-driving a horse. I used to drive more and worked with a horse that couldn't hear well. With him I'd use a carriage whip (4-5ft stick with a string on it) to tap him on the butt since he couldn't hear my verbal commands. 
2- lunging horses. Lunging is a type of ground exercise where you make the horse move around you in a circle and it helps excoriate the horse and improve your communication. It can be done in a round pen or on the end of a long lead line. Then I use a long whip to make my arm look longer so the horse can see the movement more easily. As horse get used to lunging you don't need that long extension as much. 
3-I currently do a lot of trail riding with a mare who is still learning about the wide world and gets nervous of grass piles, of trees, of sinister dirt clouds, and god help us if theres a rabbit... you get the idea. when's she's nervous she stops listening to verbal communication and leg aids but I've found I can touch her shoulder in front of my knee with a crop and it brings her attention back to me. Normally I'd use my hand to touch her shoulder but with this horse I need to keep my hands on the reins so I keep the crop in one hand too. Once her attention is on me we can then work on calming her down and teaching her that the scary dirt clod won't hurt her. She's a great horse, just young and inexperienced. (And a hot Arabian to boot) "
"Forgiving someone if they make a mistake. For example, last week, my bus driver made a wrong turn and had to loop back around the block.

My point is he was trying to win as best as hasinshin can, he wasn't outright thinking ""mehh i hate riven I'm gonna feed"". Was he right? no I just think think it was/is blown out of proportion. For the record I also don't actually consider myself a fan of hashinshin, probably only watched 20 mins of his stream and 2 of his youtube videos (if that, i think this is the only one I watched all the way through), I actually enjoy dom and dekar's vids of them tilting hash more than hash himself) I just wish reddit would look at things less black and white.

"Weekend Update:

If any of you saw my post from about two days ago, you'll recall that I said I would be pushing a possible/probable pulley injury on the project. Well, I went to the project to see how it felt. Trying the crux sequence I broke the main hold and then felt out the other sequence I had been trying--left hand intensive--the aching finger side. Mild pain that didn't go away after warming up--which it had in the past days on it.

Emotionally, I have finally come to terms that I need a break to give my finger time to heal and decide exactly what to do next. While driving up to the project I had decided that 1 of 4 things were going to happen: do proj, not get hurt; not do proj, not get hurt; do proj, get hurt; or not do proj, get hurt. Obviously the two where I don't injure myself further were ideal; but while driving I admited that doing the project and getting hurt was acceptable. After my brain came to that conclusion, some other part of my brain started asking questions: is that how you really feel? Although I am 50, do I really think that this is it (last time I'll reach this level of fitness)? That its ok to push that hard for one route? Is this the mentality that I want to teach my kids--winning at all costs? I tried to rationalize each question, but while warming up and trying moves, finally decided the answer to all the questions was no.

At first i was angry and frustrated, maybe even a little depressed. I had put so much effort, skin, driving, blood, time away from home that i really didn't want to admit that I had failed. Is it really failure to make a good decision? My first thought:  I would pack up and go to future present--V9 compression with no crimping, but I felt like that was still climbing/trying hard and I need to start some real injury recovery, instead of what I had been doing.

So, I took my frustration out on building a landing: lifting 50-75lb blocks, dead trees and then brushing off lichen and removing loose pieces from a boulder about 20 yards up the hill and left of the whale shark boulder (giving details as it is open to anyone who wants to try it. the top out holds will need a stiffer than boar's hair brush to remove the lichen). Its really cool rising traverse on a vertical wall above a slanting roof on slopey knobs with heal hooks and deadpoints. the top out is all I haven't done involving a high heel hook and I didn't have a spotter. I think it'll be about V7 and \*\*\*. I then put some mild effort into it and just enjoyed myself playing around outside--remembering that is exactly why I climb.  I was close to doing the problem, but I had come to peace with my decision to take a break, soak in the surroundings and start the mental preparation for recovery. By the time I had to go to pick up my daughters from school, I packed up my stuff and before hoisting the pads, took in my surroundings and let out a long, happy sigh.

I took my oldest (8) to the Boulder Field and had a blast with her; she did 3 blue routes (about v1) climbing to the top of the wall (14 feet) with these huge for her high steps and deadpoints. Then we lifted weights together: I benched 120 lbs for the first time and she ran 2 miles on the treadmill! We rushed to pick up my other daughter from gymnastics. That night getting them to bed we talked about the importance of trying hard and having fun, but also when to take a step back.

Thanks all for going thru this with me--or to Reddit for providing the venue to think thru these things. This season has truly been spectacular. I have had so much fun in the mountains, making new friends and being in that space where I am physically and mentally challenged doing something I love. I also managed to do more problems that are hard for me (V8 to V10 range) than I had when I was younger. When i started this 3-4 years ago, I thought, fun, I'll be psyched if I can do another V8, which morphed this year into, maybe I can do a v11.

Special thanks to this community for keeping it real and being a steady source of positivity and great advice.

Also I just wanted to let everyone know, I make these posts for a couple of reasons. One is that i like to type things up, like a journal to formalize my thoughts. Sorry if it bugs anyone that I use this space to do that. I also like doing this as I think a lot of us go thru similar things mentally and putting it out there for people to read and think, cool, I am not crazy for thinking these things. Do I need this? No, but I love this sport and I feel this need to give something back to some community."

"Hey dudes, I feel there's something important to say in response to all the James Kent criticism going on here. Hallucinogens are dangerous. Period. Listening to Joe Rogan, reading Michael Pollan's new book (or any psychedelic book), watching psychedelic Youtubers, and just being a member of the psychedelic community might give you a different impression, but the problems in the community that Kent discusses in his podcast are still very relevant. 

Read all the Johns Hopkins studies you want, but we still don't really know what psychedelics and dissos do to recreational users (long-term/frequent users). Kent talks a lot about prominent spokespeople in the community who peddled delusional garbage. That's still very much a phenomenon (just listen to Julian Palmer speak for two seconds). Psychedelics give people strange ideas, and IME self-described psychonauts run the risk of taking their own strange ideas (and the ideas of prominent advocates) way too seriously. 

If you ever start going off the deep end, you might not recognize what's happening to you. Don't gamble with your mental health, stay safe, and stay rational.  "

"I see these bugs and oversights as creating a weird sort of balance in the game. Bulbasaur on paper is woefully underpowered and the worst starter, but its auto critting Razor Leaf and Toxic Seed combo gives it powerful late game tools that no other Pokemon can boast. Auto-crit in general gives a damage boost to many, many Pokemon including Charmeleon in the mid-late game and Sandshrew and Mankey very early. Poison's weakness to Bug moves allows Beedrill, the sole learner of the move Twineedle, to sweep three quarters of the game singlehandedly. And Wrap/Bind/Firespin/Clamp locking grants Ekans, Bellsprout, and Onix a powerful lock out tool while giving Vulpix and Ponyta the only lock out tool that never gets ignored due to type immunity. Put this on top of all the Pokemon that are just naturally good like the Gastly line, the Nidos, and just about any Water or Psychic Pokemon you can think of, and the end result is that just about every Pokemon you run into are playable. Mind you, this game is far from perfect, is busted in a competitive standpoint, and it's not exactly short on stinkers for Pokemon like Lickitung, Meowth, Scyther, and Jigglypuff, but as far as playthroughs go, this is the game with the most readily playable Pokemon by far. Not for the right reasons, perhaps, but it's still something to consider."

"He was an [American](https://www.counterpunch.org/2014/10/16/who-supported-the-khmer-rouge/) and [British](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2014/04/how-thatcher-gave-pol-pot-hand) pawn who used communist ideals and anti-imperialist anger against the U.S. for the ""secret"" bombing of Cambodia to win people over despite admitting never even reading Marx, and was defeated by communist Vietnam and Cambodian communists.

&gt;According to journalist Elizabeth Becker, U.S. National Security  Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski ‚Äúhimself claims that he concocted the idea  of persuading Thailand to cooperate fully with China in its efforts to  rebuild the Khmer Rouge.‚Äù Brzezinski said, ‚ÄúI encouraged the Chinese to  support Pol Pot. I encouraged the Thai to help the D.K. \[Khmer Rouge  government-in-exile of Democratic Kampuchea\]. The question was how to  help the Cambodian people. Pol Pot was an abomination. We could never  support him, but China could.‚Äù In fact, U.S. support went well beyond  encouraging others to rebuild the Khmer Rouge.  
&gt;  
&gt;\---  
&gt;  
&gt;On the political front, in 1979 the United States and China wielded  their influence and pushed through a vote in the UN General Assembly in  favor of granting Cambodia‚Äôs UN seat to the ousted Khmer Rouge regime,  and **terminated a UN investigation into Khmer Rouge crimes**. The following  year, the United States again supported the Khmer Rouge in the UN as  the ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù representative of the Cambodian people. With U.S.  backing, Cambodia would continue to be represented in the United Nations  by a Khmer Rouge diplomat until 1993.

Take it from the man himself:

&gt;""When I die, my only wish is that Cambodia  remain Cambodia and belong to the West. It is over for communism, and I  want to stress that.""

In Gaza, they can achieve the same thing. Slings, firebombs, and rifles won't defeat Israel. Shooting rockets at Israeli towns is not protecting Palestinians, it is waging a war.

If they stop that war, there won't be a war.

That seems unlikely.

What they do is buy some land, plant some trees, wait, Government changes, jobs... wait, forestry industry provided jobs... cut the tress down and sell it for lumber.  

Planting trees doesn't sequester carbon for ever, the trees die, forest fires occur etc and they give it back.  You need to burn the trees, extract the CO2 (massively energy intensive and not efficient but we'll ignore that) and then geo sequester it underground for millennia... i.e BECCS, a solution only madman would entertain and yet here we are ... included in every IPCC report as "" the solution"".

"The higher the caco, higher the caffeine "
"I think it's not so much about specific foods, as it is a philosophy of food. Raw foods and leaner meats vs heavily processed or refined foods. 

For example, raw vegetables have considerably more bulk (inedible fiber) and less calories than processed foods. Consider whole wheat with the bran and germ still on it, versus flour which is more densely packed, and made only of the inner, starchy part of the wheat kernel. The refining makes it taste better, but it removes most of the nutritional value and concentrates the amount of calories by weight. 

Perhaps a better modern equivalent would be the gorilla diet. Gorillas spend most of their day foraging for food because they need large amounts of calories, and the food available to them is calorie poor, so they have to eat a lot of it. 

When dieting, fighting hunger is the deal breaker for many people, but if they can feel full and satisfied, while consuming less calories, then they aren't really dieting, they just aren't eating hyper calorie packed, specialized foods. 

Lastly, raw foods take longer to digest, and because our GI tracts are relatively short compared to most omnivores, we don't extract as much nutrition and calories from our food as animals that have longer GI tracts do. So the things we do to make food easier to digest, like processing and cooking, also make it easier for us to absorb calories from it. Raw foods don't have time to be fully digested before they are already on their way out of us. "

Mine had it too, just it was pro-EU propaganda. And my chemistry textbook used obese Americans as an example of heterotrophy. That is not a joke. They even handed out free diaries at one point, with a picture of a bunch of multiracial kids pulling the borders out of a map of the EU. It's different but it's also the same.

Anyway, if Hungarian kids are anything like Dutch kids, they're probably making a big mockery of it and not taking it seriously. "

"Question: are there really no bottleneck type effects on the population in Iceland, the same way there are with other groups (like Ashkenazi Jews, for example)? 

I know there is probably a greater influx of immigrant/outsider DNA in Iceland than in a population with ideological reasons for not marrying outside of their group, but as a small, cold island I would think that historically the population would‚Äôve still stemmed from a relatively small number of people, and thus the people there would be far less admixed than elsewhere"

"For a Sequel Trilogy that pats itself on the back for being so ""woke,"" it's quite telling how much of a downgrade the ST's representation of women and minorities are compared to the OT's. I mean, consider:

OT women: There's like 4, and two of them die (Oola, Beru) due to the bad guys deciding to be absolute dicks (Oola because she refused to give Jabba the Hut some sucky sucky, Beru because the Stormtroopers decided to torch the place). Two others (Leia, Mon Mothma) are women in high positions of power, with the former being one of the heroes of the Trilogy.

ST women: There's 6 women of note: Rey, Rose, Paige, Leia, Holdo, and Phasma. Rey was the main hero of the trilogy but she is sidelined in her own story so she can go gaga over the genocidal space-nazi. Paige is killed so Rose can cry about it. Rose was a character for like three minutes before she's reduced to being a soapbox. Leia gets reduced screentime in TFA and is put into a coma for two thirds of TLJ. Holdo is shown to be a beeee-atch for most of TLJ, and is then killed off in what could have been a heroic sacrifice if it amounted to anything. And Phasma...was there.

OT minorities: Just Lando. Dude is a well respected leader of his own city and strikes a deal with the Empire only to keep his city out of their conflict. Is betrayed, so he decides to become a Rebel and leads the main assault against Death Star 2 AFTER he plays a key role in Han Solo's rescue.

ST Minorities: four (Poe, Finn, Rose, Paige) Paige dies in five minutes after she is introduced and gets one throwaway line. Poe is reduced to a hothead who needs the guidance of a White Woman (tm) to learn to be better. Finn is a joke. Rose is a soapbox AND a sexual assaulter.

"The reason it says that is because you've ignored 100 curators. You have a limit of how many curators you can ignore.

"My friend worked as a shipping coordinator for an organ donation facility. The second you are pronounced dead/braindead, they start the process of contacting facilities to see what area needs what sort of organ. 

This all sounds nice, but there are certain quotas that need filled, as organ donation is a business. If you are registered as an organ donor, they WILL take your corneas, femurs, and tissue, among other things, even if they are not needed. Certain biological laboratories purchase these to turn a profit from medical research. The sad part is that many of these samples will never be used for anything at all, instead, just sitting in storage until they are discarded of. 

If you are an organ donor, I would recommend talking to your family about what you want to be donated so that when the companies come calling, you know what all you are comfortable with giving away. In some states, having 'Organ Donor' is a go-ahead for taking EVERYTHING if they want to. And they'll talk about what they brought for lunch while they do it. They cut your legs open like a pig and just jam the femur up towards your torso until the connective tissue snaps like a large-scale chicken wing. I would recommend something along the lines of ""No Tissue"" and ""No Bone"", unless you want your body completely mutilated for the sake of business before your funeral.

The sounds of tearing muscle, disrespect for the dead, and the for-profit mentality are mainly why my friend is no longer working in the field."

"Would prefer Lukaku in place of Mueller and sub him in later since he has the super sub trait, and Lukaku is amazing ig.

Maldini as wide CB in place of Florenzi and Varane completing your central defense.

You should look for a good defensive minded midfielders since Pekerman is already about attack, and with two AMFs and Casemiro (whose form is suspect most of the times), it may turn easy for your opponents to slot goals past you. Also, Socrates will run off steam after 60mins, so you need a good player to sub him as well.

So ideally, Dinho - some good DMF like Matic/Gustavo or even CMF like Vidal - CMF who can aid attacks, will be a good midfield setup.

Great team, nevertheless :)"

Well...TUE has got him now.
"It's easier to say that looking at them in hindsight. They brought to alternative/noise/rock the ""avant-garde"" compositions of Glenn Branca, for example, Branca's piece:

 Hallucination City (the 100 guitar piece), the tunings for that piece are ""unison octave tuning."" The 3 low strings are all tuned the same and the 3 high strings are all tuned the same an octave higher.  


The Alto guitars are tuned to E. The low E is an octave higher than the low E on a conventional guitar, the high E is the same as a high E on a conventional guitar.  
For strings - the low E is a .22 wound string, the high E an .08 or .09.  


The Tenor guitars are tuned to B. The low B is a fifth higher than the low E on a conventional guitar, the high B is the same as a B on a conventional guitar.  
For strings - the low B is a .30 wound string, the high B an .11 or .12.   


They took these sort of alternate tunings and unconventional setups (Screwdrivers shoved between the strings and fretboard) and brought it to a style of music that was just starting to hit the general public. A lot of it is timing, this was before the internet, so while they may not have been the first to have ever experimented with these things, they were perhaps the first in many areas to find their records on the shelves of shops.  


[How Sonic Youth Came to Make the Sound it Makes](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/10/arts/pop-jazz-how-sonic-youth-came-to-make-the-sound-it-makes.html) is an archived NY Times article from 1990 to give you some historical perspective of how they were viewed. An apt quote from another article used a David Bowie quote ""It's not who does it first, It's who does it second"".

I also wanted to make one for my favorite ships, but aside from some of my minimalist/vector wallpapers and also [that time I made my own little art for a 3x3 back during the best ships contest](https://i.imgur.com/GalOImA.png), I *could not* find fanart for two of the ships, so I thought I was gonna have to give up the idea.

There are 325 million people in the US which is over 48,000,000 girls 17-24.

Now let's say she's in the top 10% of all 17-24 girls (she's not, but let's indulge), we'll discard the other 90% just like we've discarded anyone older than 24 (easily done.)

She is competing for attention with 4.8 million other girls.  They're all on instagram and they're all immediately available to you.

She has nothing to offer that a few million other girls are giving away for less."

Apparently my ability to detect colors and nuances therein was super important to me and I felt attacked.

As someone that mains Shaolin the best way to counter qi stance is to wait for the shaolin to actually do something from it. All the attacks from qi stance are guardable/parryable. From the kick unless they use the guaranteed light from it the follow up sweep &amp; top unblockable heavy can be dodged. Since most Shaolin users rarely cancel qi stance once they enter it by waiting for them to act you reduces the punishment you receive to just 1 light attack.

"I don't know.  It just seems a lot to me.  Yes it sometimes take a few years to develop young kids, but the same can be said about every career.  And sometimes kids are ""ready-made"" for senior footy.

I think the other issue is that allowing clubs to tie a player for three years doesn't stop them asking for a trade or feeling they're not a good fit at a particular club.  It will literally make no difference to that happening, as it's a personal issue not a commercial contract one.  If anything, knowing you're ""*tied to a three year contract*"" could exacerbate the feeling of pressure on some young kids.

If a kid is happy at a club, then after their two year contract (or even before it ends), they can sign on to extend it.  But by using a longer contract as some kind of enforcement, you're tacking the issue (kids who want to walk) the wrong way.  It shouldn't be about *enforcement* and *constraint*, it should about encouragement and incentive."

"I believe that social problems stem from psychological ones, since societies are made up of individuals.

In response to your point about sex slaves in war: Women were taken advantage of because they were seen as weak, a negative trait. Women were not allowed to participate in the draft because they were seen as weak, again a negative trait. Men were a part of the draft because they were seen as strong, a positive trait. This is the difference.

Poor/middle class people were considered stupid, vulgar, and unnecessary, (all negative traits) so these men were drafted and had to fight in dangerous areas. Wealthy people were considered intelligent, cultured, and necessary, (all positive traits) so they used the power afforded by wealth to avoid the draft or to only be stationed in the safest areas.

Oppression is necessarily linked to what a society values. Oppressed groups are considered less valuable.

But I did talk to a male friend, who argued that there is an idea of ‚Äúsave the women and children first.‚Äù  While I debated that this idea comes from society viewing women and children as weak, he argued that it comes from it being biologically important for primitive humans to save women and children so that the species could more easily reproduce. We had a super interesting conversation about what should be the role of primitive human instincts given that we now live in an overpopulated world, we produce children that are less likely to die, and we often live to much older ages.

I like deep conversations. :)"

"They don't HAVE to die, but it creates drama. Since the show is basically a crime drama, you need to do that. Character deaths also up the stakes and make the show feel more grounded, especially developed characters and/or characters that you don't expect to die (Ms Cardenas, Ben Urich, Grotto, etc). 

Also, like I said, Karen's death would pretty much ensure Frank Castle showing up and being 100% determined to kill Dex. That would lead to really interesting conflict between him and Matt, which (as we saw in Season 2) makes for fucking awesome TV."

If my post wasn't self-explanatory then I don't think you have enough understanding of cloud services to be making the suggestions in your OP?

Niantic would not have to go and upgrade multiple datacentres.  They would make a few clicks and then Google (or Amazon or Microsoft...) will instantly allocate the resources - which they have plenty spare because they are constantly selling more computing resources.  Honestly, the most time consuming part of the process would be billing administration.

Again, have you _actually_ used any of these services?

Or perhaps you're overestimating how much space Pok√©mon take up?  Let's run some numbers.

A Pok√©mon Ruby save file is 128kb and can store 420 Pok√©mon.  The Gen 3 games store much more data per Pok√©mon than Pok√©mon GO does, and of course that's the entire save file rather than just the Pok√©mon.  So let's say an increase of 1000 Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon GO is 256kb.

200 Million accounts I think you suggested?  The increase would be less than 50 Terabytes.  That may seem a lot to you, but that's nothing to Google.  They'll be allocating much more than that on a daily basis."

"Friendship breakups need to start becoming more commonplace and understood in society.  So many people will dump someone who is shitty in a relationship, but hold on to a shitty friendship because the other party can't take a hint that friendships can end, too.  I had to tell my best friend of 20 years that she had just become too much; too much negativity, her relationship with her boyfriend had become our only topic of consistent discussion and I was exhausted of hearing about it and giving advice that wasn't ever considered or taken.  I started by saying I needed to take a break to get my own self regrounded and in a good place mentally.  Then I never reached back out and wouldn't return messages.  It also sounds like either she needs to be asked to leave the team or your group should find another venue.  Preferably the first option."

"This is good information.  

I know erythorbate accelerates the transition of nitrite to nitric oxide which in turn reduces residual nitrites and is used in bacon when quick curing is performed and with brines.

Though I am curious if it helps further when you're doing a longer ~7 day dry cure and whether it also reduces nitrosamine formation in a separate action (apart from the acceleration of nitrite curing)?

Certainly something to look more into as I've never seen it suggested for home curing bacon, but that's not to say it isn't a good idea.  

My experience has only been as a hobby and never on the commercial side, so there's no doubt plenty to learn on the topic."

the first recommendation is to check if the company card is listed on your personal credit file. 

the second recommendation is to gently remind your employer that a CC in your name, is basically using employees to finance the company's operations which is messed up. ask for a debit card or CC that's not tied to you personally.

"(some bits are translated from French, I don't know how accurate what I'm writing is)

For me I'd say that it is the number of standard deviations you have with the people you're interacting with that is important. I was told that you communicate more efficiently with people close to your IQ. In the IQ scale (if 100 is the average) the standard deviation is 15, and if there is more than two standard deviations between two people some communication difficulties may appear.

I don't know how accurate that is (even in French) so if you could correct me if I'm wrong, I'd be really interested to know what you heard/thought about that."

"I never implied you were, this is the problem with large religions as a whole, not with you as a believer.

To clarify, something like 97.5% of all christians are recruited by church officials, or born into Christian families, that‚Äôs the vast majority.

That means that 97.5% of christians shouldn‚Äôt be Christian‚Äôs, they were pressured, pushed, or promised something that no human being has the right to promise. Alternatively it‚Äôs all they‚Äôve known from growing up in a religious household. Without that direct connection, the vast majority of those people don‚Äôt become Christians.

Everyone‚Äôs ready to talk about how great god is, nobody‚Äôs ready to bring the proof, is the epitome of the large churches. 

The fact is, more followers=more money=more power, this is and always has been the way of religion since it‚Äôs inception, recruitment came from greed, not god. 

At the end of the day religion is something like a conscience, it should be a personal belief that, like you say, doesn‚Äôt line up with others, the issue is, your belief does line up with others, many times over, because it‚Äôs actually a belief you were taught, and therefor it‚Äôs not personal and that‚Äôs where religion is flawed.

Everyone else is referring to the server that hosts SEA games, which is owned and maintained by valve, and has been consistently giving packet loss issues. 

Naturally, I cannot claim to know with impunity *how* valve maintains servers, but the fact of the matter is, as one of many consumers who have been enjoying relatively smooth service for the preceding months, this sudden drop in quality of gameplay, which is not due to my own client side connectivity or gcu issues, is not acceptable.

Title: **Claim of Encroachment on neighboring open lot.**

Original Post: 

&gt; I just got a letter from the agent that is selling the property that is next to ours. I put up a fence this past summer and got a permit from the township when I did (based on the aerial view from the township I moved in to try and ensure I was on my property but didn't get a official survey). The agent representing the land development company is claiming encroachment of 2ft on the north end and 0.7-1ft on the south end of the fence. The land development claims they used in house software to determine the encroachment and if we want to dispute we can get a surveyor.
&gt; 
&gt; My questions is, can they legally claim encroachment if they did not have a official survey of the land completed? and is that my responsibility to prove that I am not versus them proving that I am?

I get to be a woman; and there is nothing they can say or do to me to make that a bad thing. After a lifetime of hating myself, I finally love myself; and they can't take that away from me.

Why are you doing this? Because you get to be a woman, too. We are so privileged. Enjoy every moment of every day, because you get to live the dream."

"Few months back UPS left my GTX 1080 on my front porch while I was at work. I was completely livid as not only had I requested a signature, if there was no one there, they‚Äôd take it to the store.

I found it sitting on my wet porch, saying ‚Äúsorry we missed you‚Äù with the signature slip taped to the package and a bogus signature.

I called UPS immediately and said I never accepted this package and got a ‚Äúyou signed for it, nothing we can do.‚Äù

I now schedule myself to be home whenever a package is due to arrive (regardless of the waste of time) and I will chase down the delivery drivers if they throw my package on my porch again. 

Most recently, I ordered a new mouse for my PC, and it was expected to arrive while I was at work. Switch my days around and had that one off. They decided to throw my mouse from the bottom of the stairs up to my porch. I opened my door so fast the delivery driver took of running. I ran down the stairs, gave him that package and called the company I purchased my mouse through. I then called UPS once more, and complained, though, I can assure you, nothing happened. Again. 

There‚Äôs thousands of late high schoolers/college students who want to work for UPS and will a good job doing so. Report your shitty delivery drivers."

"&gt;I'm not really questioning any of my sister's surgeons decisions. I think he's a good person.

hm.

&gt;This is pretty explicitly prax but even more comprehensive research can demonstrate there are perverse incentives. Even if I assume my sister's surgeon is an angle (which I am, I don't think he's made any bad decisions, we have no regrets), he cannot control the entire system system that will lead in this kinda stuff happening more than it should.

Science takes a long time to develop and will need practice and journal reporting to improve methods. Just because the absolute science isnt there does not mean the surgery cant yield results for some people. The statistics and continued improved educations of doctors will advance medical science. It is very frustrating how slowly science moves sometimes in the medical field and it is an absolute hell fight to allocate money for better practices. Doctors are very vulnerable to politics and moneyed interests and as such have very little ability to push medical practices nowadays. You could be taking away money from doctors and scientists who spent years and years specializing and inventing an outdated method. Sharks are everywhere. 


I know quite a few doctors who absolutely hate 'economic micro-incentivisation' on adapting healthcare. They are in it for the patients health and assuming otherwise is insulting. 

Every patient is different with different circumstances and monetizing normalizing condition outcomes is absolutely going to lead to an aversion of doctors taking on challenging cases. Sometimes they go in with bad odds to fix a problem and quite frankly get paid less (because of 'non-nominal' outcome). This incentivizes a triage war on who gets to treat a bad case even when the doctor wants to help the patient. Bad cases take time (which they will get talked to by administrators on for taking too long) and resources (which they will probably get talked to by administrators for using too much money).   Hell even overall hospitals will fight to dump patients.

Not all administrations are expressly adaptive to patient care. They can continue to tell departments or individual doctors who take bad cases that they should be more like the ones who dont take the bad cases even if it is not their fault. If they consistently take bad cases they will be targeted by the cycling of administrators trying to justify their management. 


I agree that monetization will help but there are outgoing pressures that will feel insulting to the doctors that actually manage patient care. Most doctors dont have time to discuss with administrators because they have so little energy and time to reconstruct or adapt to management.

Also those boxes you need to check for money... the system is abused. Physicians are trained to be competitive so they are the best at care and that invades all areas of being. So you better believe they are competitive on salary too.  So if you want pre-monetization level of compensation you have to 'navigate' and check the boxes for those who can afford it. These boxes include levels of detail on further care or potential care, observation of rashes or other things will bump your compensation levels.

"It depends on what phone you use. A pad will probably be optimum to play on, but i played on iphone SE and if i can do it so can u. 

The gameplay smoothness varies depending on the FPS you set. 15 fps and u will be have delay in actions, but not detrimental unless u are bossing. 

Battery drainage is slowest with 15 fps, so if you are skilling then that will probably be the best. 

Data usage is very low, to the point where you should not worry about data. 

As for gameplay, i personally prefer doing skilling on mobile since bossing/slaying/combat is more enjoyable on PC with runelite client. Mobile is best for thieving, fly fishing, woodcutting, firemaking, 14x skilling such as herblore. 

Do note that at least for ios, the afk timer is much shorter than PC, i think about 1 minute? 

Otherwise mobile is enjoyable."

A mental disorder isn't just some deviation from the norm, it has to be causing you distress as well. 

Life having a ""goal"" doesn't really make sense from a scientific point of view. You're anthropomorphizing a process that has no intelligence or will. It doesn't have goals or desires or preferred outcomes."

"It's virtually impossible to completely seperate two networks without blowing up costs or having to absorb massive inefficiencies. You're talking about every person in every one of these departments having two computers, two mobile phones, new mobile and fibre tech infrastructure having to be deployed across the country over millions of kilometres, hauling and civil works crews being deployed across the country etc.

The cost would be in the hundreds of billions and then probably cost somewhere in the low tens of billion dollars or more yearly in maintainance...

All to just prevent someone remotely hacking the network so a foriegn entity sends HUMINT instead, or some idiot plugs the wrong computer into the wrong ethernet port, or does as many do and plugs an uncertified USB into their PC.

This is also without assuming some spy can enter a facility and deploy their wares on the new networks many switches etc. It would be trivial to create a bridge that would allow remote access without anyone noticing.

"There were pro-pedophilia LGBT advocates in the 70's and 80's, rather prominent, too.

Once one domino (societal norm) falls, another falls, then another, then another, and then yet another.

It feels like it actually may be a slippery slope, but fucking kids is a very spikey part of that slope. Allegedly, the elites of hollywood and politics utilized homosexuality in the past as a way of gaining blackmail on each other to keep each other in line. Basically, in order to become part of the higher echelons, you gotta fuck someone of the same sex.

Child molestation (which is what you truly mean) is, again allegedly, the go to choice for ensuring blackmail nowadays. That and well, actual factual real life ""snuff"" and cannibalism, and turning guys into girls.

As for why they'd push child abuse and molestation - again, allegedly, the problem has gotten so bad in these elite circles that information about it is beginning to leak out, and they don't want to get lynched a trillion times over by the public, actually lynched, brutally murdered, when it finally comes out entirely. So they want to soften the blow.

"First, the easy one - The survey. We have over 8 million members and get over 500k responses to this survey every year. We also put out satisfaction surveys and others to a nationally-representative population using a 3rd party distributor. I'm biased but I think those numbers and our methodology are pretty solid. With numbers that large, the data usually wash out responses that are meaningless. 

Next - cost of repairs. You're totally right, it's very varied! More expensive repairs to a more expensive car might be justified when you look at that ratio. Consumers do tell us all about them though and we spend a lot of time read them, especially when we see patterns.

Lastly - the scores are weighted, as you mentioned, but would be overwhelming if we didn't consolidate them into an overall score. You can find more detailed specifics for each make and model on our website if you want to cross shop the features that are important to you :)

Hope that helps!

"This is just another ad in need of actual fact-checking. It's pretty shameful to pretend to be so unbiased while leaning so heavily toward studies supporting the opposition and dismissing studies supporting the initiative.  Take a look at the most robust air quality study I've personally seen. When wind blows from the East, from fracking-epicenter Weld county into Boulder county, carcinogens and toxins are increased, and that's from a distance much further than 2500 ft. Some of the heaviest pollution days in Boulder are directly related to fracking activity. I wish we had this kind of data statewide. In the past it's been too easy to obfuscate how much was from cars and how much was from industry. By measuring and tracking the right contaminates, these things are knowable. 

http://instaar.colorado.edu/arl/boulder_reservoir.html

Don't take my word for it. However you plan to vote, there are now more than 800 peer reviewed studies looking at the health effects of fracking conducted within the last 5 years alone and I encourage to invest a few hours into making an informed decision, including investigating potential conflicts of  interest. This economic argument does not begin to justify jeopardizing the health of Coloradoans, especially given that it is the youngest and oldest citizens most affected.

Lastly I'll just say this: It's not a matter of if we must start moving past fossil fuels, but a matter of when. They're unrenewable. We know we must find cleaner solutions. We know this. Why then must add all of this methane into our environment along the way? Why must we contaminate and wast water along the way? In a state that is already struggling with water and projected to be one of the most drought-struck states by 2050. Our economy is not dependent on fracking. It cannot be. If we allowed it to be, that would on the planet that manages to somehow play the victim every chance they get. "

No no no, on the contrary, my metabolism is slow as fuck and I drink a fuckton of beer, I do have to put some effort on the not-getting-fat thing. 

What pisses me off is that I wasn't being demeaning or anything, legitimately I tried to explain how calories work, how that extra coke you take with every meal ADDS A LOT, how walking 30-60 mins everyday adds up too, but in the end I was dismissed as ""just being lucky"". I guess the year I dropped 16kg while training/eating good was just luck too.

"The very fact that such a thing exists it means that US is freer than many countries in the world.

In China, basically, you own nothing. Everything is the govenrments so at a moment's notice they can take it from you.

In US's example they have to at least find a BS reason to do so. And sometimes those BS reasons can be challenged. Not to say that that's a great way of things, merely that US is freer on said specturm. There are obviously even freer countries.

In the end we should strive -with whatever means possible- to make private property unassailable. Whatever you worked for and won is yours and not anybody else's ... and the law should be there to protect that very concept (of private property). 

Once people can *actually* own things they tend to take better care of them and in the end build on them. It's why eastern block counties (after a few decades) looked like they went through some major war and why countries with strong property rights were in the other end of things (well groomed garden, much more beautiful homes ... etc). Property makes people responsible and thus those societies better working. IMO China (and the rest) are shooting themselves in the foot through not allowing their populace to basically own anything..."

Which means yes, the rest of their body will be in the shot and redditors are looking at the entire body when they see the post. The same is true of the boob subs, r/boobs and r/tits. 

I think it's fairly easy to tell the two women you posted apart if you could only see everything below their waist to the end of their thighs, just as it's fairly easy to tell two women apart if you could only see their naked torso. The way an ass looks, feels, and is structured is strongly related to the same properties of the waist, hips, thighs/legs, and back, which perhaps makes it harder to separate from the body than boobs. However, the same is also true of boobs if not nearly to the same extent; big boobs on one woman may look smaller/worse on another, or they may sag differently, be more perkier, list to different sides differently, or center differently. See my point?

With that out of the way, even though you seem to be comparing the photos you posted purely on ass shape (despite their radically different poses), each girl's ass is shaped very obviously different to me. The first girl has a wider ass that more readily curls into the top of the thighs without as readily bubbling into perky, protruding cheeks as the third girl. On the other hand, the third girl has cheeks that are more oblong from top to bottom than the first. And that's without looking at the fact that the first girl has some cellulite while the third girl has stretch marks, different poses/profiles, or how their asses actually fit on their body.

Finally, the top of all time on r/ass is not a reflection of what every ass fan in the world prefers (it might work as a very rough, nominal redditor average though), just as the same is true of the boob subs. There are likely as many kinds of boobs and asses as there are people who sexually prefer each kind. 

Sorry if I was pedantic or repeated myself too much, I'm not very good at writing and wanted to make sure my points got across."

"if it was an addendum, for it to be binding, you would have had to sign it and be provided a copy.  Landlord should be able to produce a signed by you copy of said addendum, otherwise legally it does not exist.

with a ""no smoking"" clause (assuming it's been legally added), it's incumbent upon the landlord to prove it. 

A lease can't be modified after the fact unless both parties agree and both sign.

You need to pull your copy of your lease, as well as ask the landlord to provide a signed copy of the addendum showing you agreed to said post-facto changes to the lease.

This may be a battle you don't want to fight, and it may be easier to look into the exit clause of your lease, and find different accommodations.  

Is there any other reason the landlord or another tenant by be trying to ""get you in trouble"" ?

You could potentially end up in court depending on how this all goes, and if there actually is an in force no smoking addendum that was properly implemented, or even if it wasn't, you could still end up on court and the landlord would lose for violating contract law but you could still find it a bad living situation until your lease is up.

Good luck, and it may be worth a stop in /r/legaladvice or speaking with an attorney to ensure your bases are covered and ensure you  are documenting all communication/interaction from this point forward for your own use and protection."

"I tend to focus now on; ""Is this game even fun enough for me to continue playing?"" as the basis for playing. I've seen and played dozens of games where I'm this badass or soft-spoken shy protagonist whose destiny or is the chosen one or is the last of their kind cast into a pretty linear storyline. Where the game's story is scene for scene, predictable.

It's just incredibly hard to impress now with a story. I've seen great stories told in RPGs like the Mother series, Pillars of Eternity, Diablo, Fable, Bard's Tale, Ultima, Fallout, Torchlight, Jade Empire, Titan Quest, Shadowrun, Pokemon .etc been there and done that.

The moment a story even begins ""this village was plunged into darkness...world is at stake"" is enough for me to get to know what to expect. I suppose the characters in the story can make a difference, however again, I've seen them with different faces within the very games I've mentioned above."

"Taking a medical anthropology class right now, and yeah, it's already changed a decent amount of how I think about health &amp; healing systems. It's mostly just opened my eyes up to how ethnocentric and reductive biomedicine can be when it's the only considered approach.

Obviously many biomedical interventions *are* important and beneficial, but I am starting to feel we need to examine health issues more holistically. Not everything can be reduced to some divergence from the norm on a physiological level, I think many health issues stem from (and can be addressed through) social/environmental/cultural circumstances and interventions.

One of the more striking arguments I've encountered in my textbook is that a lot of the resources poured into aide in exporting biomedicines (usually unsustainably) into developing countries could be better directed towards much more basic things (with better health outcomes). These are things like nutritious food, clean water, adequate shelter, and sanitization. Not everything needs a highly technical solution.

Unfortunately it also seems like a lot of disparities in health are less about interventions on individual levels and more about systematic/institutional violence (of which patriarchy is a core component).

A lot of people swear by the book version of things over films more often than not, which is more of a bias than anything else. Despite that, it's a bias that stems from some legitimacy. They did genuinely enjoy the book. And I enjoyed the book, that's all I'm saying.

"Why do you get to seperate communists from liberals, but i cant seperate white nationalists from conservatives? If were both being honest we can see that they are all quite seperate. But you were talking about left and right. Its silly to say communists dont count as left.

Why cant we both understand that neither one of us has a damn thing to do with these crazy people. And that things that they did should not reflect on you nor me? Thats all im saying.


Im not aware of any false flag terrorist attacks in the past. But until we know who did this, its not outside the realm of possibility that it was perpetrated by someone who is not right wing at all.

"300mg comes to 10mg/day for a month dose. It probably doesn't release *that* perfectly, but let's work with that. 

That's just about the higher end of where you'd still be able to feel a shot on top of it. 

Bupe has an extremely strong binding affinity. Because of this, other opioids typically have difficulty switching out with bupe once it binds to the receptor (notwithstanditg some fentanyl derivatives maybe). However, if you're not totally saturating your receptors (which most doses don't...you don't have to saturate all available sites to develop a dependency or to sate a craving), then you would still be able to feel the opiate on top of the bupe (though its effect would feel different than taking your DOC by itself). 

The relative concentration of drugs is also important. Think if you have magnets in a tube, and magnetic balls. Now, the stronger balls are going to grip tightly and not let go easily. But if you toss a huge mass of the weaker balls through the tube, some of the fewer strong ones will still get knocked off, and the weak ones will take that spot for a time. But if you started with a lot of strong balls, even if a lot of the weaker balls moved in that space, it's still more likely that the strong ones will take the place of any open magnets. That's not exactly how it works but I think it a good enough conceptualization to get my point across. "

"They are payed by studio, however because most porn ends up being pirated and put up on tubesites for free many porn studios have had to close down and it forces the wages for people in the industry down.

So if you truly care about good porn you should look into getting a paid subscription on the websites of your favourite stars and studios. "

for example, david wright and albert belle have really had pretty similar careers. but one was much friendlier to the media than the other, and i expect we'll see that the difference between how they perform on the ballot will be much larger than the difference between their quality as baseball players.

edit: to be perfectly clear, i think they're about even as players, and i don't think either is quite HOF-worthy. but i'd be shocked if wright falls off the ballot in 2 years."

"I agree, the fact that they have Mike and Bryan as showrunners and producers gives me faith that it could be good, but even if it is good I resent this notion that even a good or faithful live action adaptation of something animated needs to be made at all. It feels as if people think animation isn't good enough, and a live action version is a more complete realization of someone's creative vision or something."
"The first time I queried with my debut, it was about a week.  I got lucky that one agent I queried really liked the voice, was new, and was willing to help me polish it. This is honestly an exception. That draft was an unholy mess and needed *a lot* of work. Most agents won't be willing to do that.

The second time I queried, for my third book, it was about a year of editing and revising (including multiple rounds with critique partners) to get it into what I felt was the best shape it could be in for querying.  This is probably more typical.  Basically, I made sure the manuscript was as good as I could possibly make it on my own."

"Bullshit.

The Right wing not only tries to suppress opposing viewpoints, but actively suppresses voting in a democracy to get their way.

Their views on the environment are going to get everyone killed, they hate people of color and LGBT and embrace Nationalism.  They support a Russian asset in office dismantling the country from within, and value money for rich people over people themselves.

The left fights against that, and if you think that is the same, you are the problem.

two main reasons. It's pretty hard to get an engineering job in my country at the moment because the field is over saturated and there aren't much jobs due to our failing economy.

My plan is to eventually leave the country and find a job elsewhere. That's why I'm perusing a career in software development.

"Ok, well if building sites like these is something you want to do more of, possibly full time, I would advise not to spend a tonne of time learning old school Wordpress template stuff (past what you need to do for your friend), and really make it your goal to understand how to build a headless Wordpress site with a front end framework, like React.

This will set you apart from the millions of WP theme devs on fiver and upwork, and you will be ahead of the curve, using new technology that makes wayyy better sites and interfaces (because of React or Vue or whatever). And you don't even really need to know too much about WP to do this, you just need to know how to install it and set it up really, then you add in a couple of plugins (Advanced Custom Fields etc) and pass all the data through to your front end.

Check out this tutorial, see if you can follow along even, you will see the benefits and power of a headless WP setup, and what it would look like for you building sites like the one for your friend: 

[https://medium.com/@jchiatt/headless-wordpress-with-react-d573bca02ee0](https://medium.com/@jchiatt/headless-wordpress-with-react-d573bca02ee0)

&amp;#x200B;

It's not going to be an overnight thing, React is a big thing  on it's own, but a valuable skill as a developer (as in it'l get you paid). I would recommend starting with some of these resources:

Beginner React (See Wes Boss's course, Brad Traversy React youtube tutorials, Steven Griders udemy courses)

Then checkout some headless wordpress tutorials.

And head over to r/reactjs of course

Intellectual property on the other hand only exists because of law. If I copy your idea you are not deprived of your idea and don't lose anything. Intellectual property laws are a relatively recent innovation and there were long periods of time where they didn't exist or were extremely limited. A great example of an absolute explosion of cultural and economic output is Italy during the rennaissance. They had no intellectual properties laws but produced some of the most impressive output of any culture ever."

They aren‚Äôt exactly expecting people to steal from there so when someone walks up to the main floor from the shop in the basement they just say ‚Äúhave a good day‚Äù and that‚Äôs it. 

But, the guy I told was actually the guy talking to me at the ATM. He was super cool about it and even ran outside to try and find the person. 

And yeah unfortunately this place is a good store but the location isn‚Äôt the best. It‚Äôs in a more run down part of town that is right inside the hood. Lots of suspicious people are always hanging around and getting thrown out of there."
I would argue that has more to do with software installation habits than OS.

"The issue is relatively small, but consider a larger character such as nightmare. Certain attacks of his are punishable in certain ways. When you give his moveset to one of the thin female body types they don't have the same hurtboxes any more because she is physically smaller. This means that some moves that would ordinarily punish him don't hit this small character. For the casual audience this is far from a big problem, but for those interested in playing at a tournament level this is seen as problematic as it unbalances the characters to some degree. It isn't a huge issue though because these characters are not tournament legal, but it does mean that playing online practicing against customized characters is less valuable then playing against non customized ones.

Tldr: hurtboxes are different"

They argue that they are basing their reasoning off of common usage of words at the time. Lincoln, for example carried around a copy of Euclid's Elements to remind himself of proper logic.

"Honestly, I can understand a bit of Schadenfreude if the first responders start accusing people of lying without knowing the complete picture, refuse to listen to people who actually might have a better idea of what's going on, start manhandling someone who's having a seizure, and are dismissive (you could say apprehensive, but that seems like an understatement) of a professional who can deescalate the situation, choosing instead to aggrevate it. In all, their actions shows little respect or care for any of the people they're supposed to be out helping.

Sure, this doesn't mean they deserve *anything* that's coming their way, and if things get worse than a little poetic justice, that Schadenfreude would quickly dissipate, but in this case I don't think it got past that poetic justice phase."

"&gt; And why no details other than putting the rubble in the sea? 

If you would actually read the prophecy you'd see that there are in fact other details.

Many of your questions would be answered by simply **reading the prophecy** even if you don't believe it was given by God.

&gt; Was this also not written in the bible for all to see? 

The Bible didn't exist in its current form when the prophecy was given.  The Torah had been written and probably some of the Nevi'im but not the entire OT and NONE of the NT.  This is a really weak argument.

This kind of circular reasoning you're doing here gets old fast.  You claim there is no God because there is no evidence for the supernatural.  I show you a prophecy that came true and cannot be entirely put down to an educated guess.  There's no way the person could've known it would happen.  You say that you won't even read it and you know the prophecy isn't from God because there is no God.  In other words: ""No God because no valid evidence, no valid evidence because no God to attribute it to.""

""Sir this witness says a crime was committed here""

""I don't believe them because there's no evidence""

""Sir we just found evidence of the crime""

""That's not evidence because we know there was no crime""

""How do we know that sir?""

"This pattern here (`pub Trait` in `priv module`) is informally called the private-in-public hack.

What you've effectively done is create a public trait that is unnamable by the outside world.

You are required to avoid using private types in a public interface because the consumer of that public API has no information about that trait with which to use your API. Unnamable traits are sometimes used for ""sealed"" traits, where the user cannot implement the trait without permission, but in this case the trait referred to in your API should still be viewable from the outside world.

If you want to formalize the use of the pattern, the typical formulation is something like:

    pub(crate) use self::priv_in_pub::Sealed;
    mod priv_in_pub {
        pub trait Sealed {}
    }

[playground example](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2015&amp;gist=60e64f43293f1b047bfe58317c2c849a)

    pub mod other_crate {
        pub mod sub_module {
            pub(in ::other_crate) use self::priv_in_pub::Sealed;
            mod priv_in_pub {
                pub trait Sealed {}
            }
        }

            impl ::other_crate::sub_module::Sealed for u16 {}

"I‚Äôve been in numerous long distance relationships for several reasons.

I‚Äôve had one where we were close but I didn‚Äôt have a car at the time and she had panic attacks for driving.

We broke up for reasons but she started seeing my one best friend that I know in real life... as you can imagine how that makes me feel. I‚Äôve never had a proper relationship. 

Ever since I‚Äôve never kissed, cuddled, laid my head in anyone‚Äôs lap. It would not be an exaggeration that I think about just... touching someone else at all. 
I try not to think about it because I feel if I did it‚Äôd be easy for me to accept anyone who gave me the time of day. So far I‚Äôve been good at that because I know if I fall for someone, anyone who gave me the time of day, I‚Äôd settle for someone I might not necessarily still love/love me further down the line... I mean sure that‚Äôs likely to happen with anyone but being more compatible with someone on a lot of levels seems to make that less likely.

I‚Äôm just so lonely... I am 25 and I haven‚Äôt even had a proper relationship where others my age are getting married. I yearn to even massage my significant other. Hug them.

I‚Äôm at a point where I feel so low that my only worth is to make someone ELSE feel good be it sexually or just to help them relax. 

I know I‚Äôm not the only one. I‚Äôm nothing special.

I don't blame the Raiders but the fact is the Raiders have put a piss poor product on the field since the last super bowl (with the only exception being two decent years under Del Rio). My fandom for the NFL has been fading because the sport has gotten boring and is too tilted toward offense. Seems like a good time to not only check out from being a raider fan but from the NFL as a whole. But you like to Stan for a coach who sucks balls."

In most cases your password can be ""password"" and still be reasonably secure if two factor auth via SMS or something like Google Authenticator is turned on.

Last thing you want is them resetting her other accounts and having the reset emails sent directly to them.  Also, if her account has an option of a backup/recovery email make sure that's set to a real address not the attacker's so they can't do a password reset of her email account and grab it from their own mailbox.  Obviously any account that's used that same password that was hijacked should be changed but I'm sure you're already on top of that. "

"&gt;IMO, a carbon tax that a % of comes back in rebates, and the rest just gets added to the general fund doesn‚Äôt do anything.

It raises the price of fuel at the pump. If you give that back as a rebate or not doesn't really make much of a difference because the taxpayer only thinks about the pump price. The idea is to put pressure on the price of fuel to push people towards bikes and electric vehicles. 

&amp;#x200B;

If we don't have a carbon tax it doesn't make much difference to the average taxpayer because tax policy doesn't change government spending. Lower taxes in one area or place in time simply means higher taxes in another. Also, if the government doesn't collect enough revenue, more tax dollars go into debt related costs and less tax dollars go into government services and infrastructure. Reduced government services and infrastructure directly impact taxpayers in the wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, government A increases taxes to build a bridge, whereas government B lowers taxes and doesn't build a bridge. People living under government A end up with reduced traffic and travel times, which reduces congestion and fuel costs in the region, but they pay more tax and prices climb because businesses pay more tax too. 

People living under government B don't get the bridge so they have to drive further, there is more congestion, and prices climb because businesses have higher transportation costs.

&amp;#x200B;

See, the tax payer gets fucked both ways. Oh and it gets worse, as whatever policy win voters get today will be undone by the next administration.

&amp;#x200B;

The only real problem with carbon tax is that it's a regressive tax that punishes rural voters because they use more fuel. There is no easy way to fix that, even with rebates.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, with regards to the effectiveness of this policy, we simply don't know because the Harper government cancelled whatever program collected the fuel efficiency stats."
"I agree that this season is worse for him than his previous seasons, but he's still overall extremely arrogant and hung up on mind games, just in general.

That is my biggest issue with him, he treated the women absolutely terribly, and one of them was a girl he claimed to be in love with at one point. It was truly appalling, and he himself said repeatedly that it was how he dealt with the women in his own life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't believe that Devin is a better or worse person than Bananas, I think that he likes to play the good guy in the situations where Bananas is being a jerk. There is nothing wrong with that, and I initially loved to see someone put Bananas in his place and I'm not going to call him a bad person, but he isn't a better person."

The idea was that people are not discouraged from buying homes and saving money. Plus  very old people are often terrible at paperwork, and that the system not involve any shame. 

We used to have it for a bit until 1983 when an income test for over 70s was phased in,, and an  assets test on pensions was introduced in 1985, which think was when keating was treasurer.   

It is also a direct bribe to the rich who make policy.  Instead of campaigning against welfare we get them to campaign for it....... the assistance of pensions at all in the future has been threatened by Scott Morrison

If everyone gets pension over 70 there is no moral outrage of hardworking  people   missing out., etc etc

"I have no doubt that if there was a specific individual or small group of individuals they have influence throughout the region.

But if you think they are literally tracking tens of thousands of people you are overestimating them.

Do you honestly think MS-13 as a group of people monitoring all people who claim asylum in Mexico?

What percentage of people and these migration Caravans do you think has this alleged mark?

As far as whether or not I am sheltered I have traveled the world to both rich countries and poor countries for whatever that is worth.

In addition I grew up outside of Los Angeles which is always at the heart of any issue regarding illegal immigration.

You might be assuming that I don't have sympathy for these people? I do.

You might be assuming that I cannot understand the perspective of these people but I can assure you if I was in their shoes I would probably do the same thing.

There is a virtually unlimited number of people willing to come if you simply open the doors and it would be impossible to offer all of them the opportunity they deserve.

All you have to do is look at the response by the ultra Progressive European countries to the migrant crisis when many of them simply shut their doors and refused to take on migrants. despite their deep progressivism they understood the devastating effects this type of mass migration can have.

There isn't a single country on Earth that would take wave after wave of these people and there is a reason for that.

"&gt; Did we lose the ability to build those rockets?

We more or less did. Yeah, we know the theory, but we've lost the experience of dealing with manned mission; many of the engineers, scientists, and managers who had experience with those types of operations and procedures are retired or dead. Plus, all the production facilities that used to make the equipment we were using have since been closed down because we weren't using them anymore.

We essentially have to do it all over from scratch again."

While I was having fun, he was constantly worried about just being a rebound :( He didn't want to get hurt but also couldn't say no to hanging out with me. The way he described it was that the one person he wanted to spend all of his time with was someone he couldn't share his feelings with. Like being trapped I guess? It's emotionally rough and might affect your mental health negatively. Romance is rough haha"
"I guess I‚Äôve finally gotten around to answering another one of these discussion questions, so here goes. By the way, thank you both for the interesting podcast, I love listening every week. It‚Äôs a great companion to Ward and Worm. 

Anyway, to answer the question, I don‚Äôt really think there is such a thing as unforgivable. When it comes down to it, people are an amazing, resilient species. There are so, so many people who would and have forgiven others for traditionally unforgivable acts, like murder or rape, even when they or someone close to them were the victim. 
I think, unforgivable doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone is truly unable to forgive that person for what they did. It means that no one would expect someone else to forgive that person for what they did. For example, almost no one sane would expect someone to forgive the person that killed their child, or did something else that is horrible, even if they tried to make amends. 

Now, to relate this to my favourite character, Amy. This, I think, is why some people call Amy unforgivable. I do not think that she is, personally. While I don‚Äôt feel like writing [another 1.6k essay](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/9f3pw7/somebody_help_me_understand_amy/e5uarmp/?st=jnntwfq4&amp;sh=9bac9116) on how what Amy did was completely understandable and shouldn‚Äôt be blamed for what she did, you can go read it if you‚Äôre interested.  

I think what Amy did was absolutely horrible, although I think that it was not her fault, and that she isn‚Äôt a monster, I think what she did is unforgivable. Because, no one sane (looking at you Carol) would ever expect Victoria to forgive Amy for what she did. She didn‚Äôt intend to do it, and immediately tried to undo it. She isn‚Äôt a monster, she was a stressed, mentally ill teenager that fucked up because an alien supercomputer fucked her over.  But she absolutely destroyed Victoria‚Äôs life for two years. Victoria still has PTSD relating to Amy, and to be honest, Amy has done a pretty shitty job of trying to make it up to her. 

Ultimately, I think Ward will have Victoria decide that what Amy did was truly unforgivable. And then push past that, and decide to forgive her anyway. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll ever go back to the relationship they had, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be sisters again or even friends. But I think that as the culmination of her character arc, Victoria will forgive the unforgivable. Not because she needs Amy for something, but because she wants to get past it, and truly move on. She‚Äôll realise that Amy isn‚Äôt a monster. That she was a scared, mentally ill, manipulated teenager, pushed far beyond her breaking point, and who made a horrible mistake because of it.

"Not a goose, but a friend of mine (Willis) is. Willis can confirm that a lot of the bitterness in the goose community comes from humans and their perception of them. Ducks are small and cute. Swans are big and beautiful. But geese are in the middle and tend to be more invasive on land, making them despised by people. Therefore, geese have to be aggressive to keep people and animals at bay. The ongoing development of human structures doesn't help either. Former gooselands now belong to people, and they've never been paid back in any significant way.

Basically, Willis says you gotta be a dick to survive among dicks."

"Had a friend I had known since teenagers, and we had multiple mutual friends, so it was hard to avoid him, but over the years he had caused so much drama for me with friends and even strangers, that on multiple occasions I had to avoid him and other people that knew him, just to stay away from the guy. The events that stand out are:

* He told some dude that I was shagging his GF, and I didn't even know the dude or his GF, and had the dude come up to me trying to beat me up, which was how I found out. Resulting in me trying to tell him I had no idea what he was talking about while he was swinging a motorcycle helmet at my face.

* Had my ex (mother of my kid) call me up, saying my friend was there. He just showed up at her house one day for a visit. They had never been friends, nor did she give him her address or asking around.  She put me on the phone to him and I had to awkwardly tell him it wasn't appropriate.

* While there were others, the last one was after not seeing him for around 5 years due to a previous incident. He showed up at my house, asking if we could be friends again. I said I'd think about it. Then some months later, he calls me up, accusing me of stealing his father's binoculars out of his father's car around 20 years earlier, which apparently was due to one of our long dead mutual friends telling him so. I just hung up on him at this point. While I did have 2 sets of binoculars, none of them were stolen, and were both decades newer than the ""old WW2 binculars"" I had been accused of stealing from him.

He's now running for Mayor."

There are thousands of kids and parents. On the side street your candy disbursement will last longer. I would give wrapped candy, like mini snickers. Unwrapped, unpackaged candy, gets thrown out. Candy corn in a little Halloween bag stapled shut, straight to the garbage can.

Here's a copy of the post before the mods removed it 

&gt; Every fan down in Smashville liked hype a lot‚Ä¶

&gt;But the Grinch, who lived somewhere in France, DID NOT!

&gt;The Grinch hated hype-ing! The whole pre-release season!

&gt;Now please don‚Äôt ask why. No one quite knows the reason.

‚Äã

&gt;It could be he was sick of all the fake leaks.

&gt;It could be, perhaps, he could not wait 6 weeks.

&gt;But I think that the most likely reason of all,

&gt;Was he knew Verg‚Äôs roster was two sizes too small.

‚Äã

&gt;Whatever the reason, the size or the wait,

&gt;He stood there on Wednesday, ready for hate.

&gt;Staring down at the banner with a sour, Grinchy frown,

&gt;At unreleased characters ‚Äì shit‚Äôs about to go down.

‚Äã

&gt;For he knew every fan down in Smashville online,

&gt;Were caught in a drought, just passing the time.

&gt;‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôre talking about Skull Kid!‚Äù He snarled with a sneer,

&gt;‚ÄúNext month is Ultimate! It‚Äôs practically here!‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously humming,

&gt;‚ÄúI must tell them somehow, they won‚Äôt see it coming!‚Äù

&gt;For each day he knew all the smash boys and smash girls,

&gt;Would cling to new leaks, it might make him hurl.

‚Äã

&gt;And then! Oh, the posts! Oh, the posts!

&gt;Posts! Posts! Posts!

&gt;That‚Äôs one thing he hated! The posts!

&gt;POSTS! POSTS! POSTS!

‚Äã

&gt;Then the fans young and old would talk and they‚Äôd guess.

&gt;And they‚Äôd guess! And they‚Äôd guess! And they‚Äôd GUESS!

&gt;GUESS! GUESS! GUESS!

‚Äã

&gt;They would guess there‚Äôd be Waddle Dee, and Minecraft‚Äôs own Steve.

&gt;Which was something the Grinch couldn‚Äôt stand to conceive.

&gt;And then they‚Äôd do something he liked least of all!

&gt;Every fan down in Smashville, the tall and the small,

‚Äã

&gt;Would all come together, like fish on a string.

&gt;Having taken the bait, oh to the threads they would cling!

&gt;His phone would ding! It would ding! It would Ding!

&gt;DING! DING! DING!

‚Äã

&gt;And the more the Grinch listened to his phone go ring ding,

&gt;The more the Grinch thought, ‚ÄúI must stop this whole thing!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúWhy, for 231 days I‚Äôve put up with it now!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúI must stop these fake leaks from coming! But how?‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;Then he got an idea! An awful idea!

&gt;THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFULLY AWFUL IDEA!

&gt;‚ÄúI know just what to do!‚Äù The Grinch laughed in his throat.

&gt;And he broke out his laptop and started to gloat.

‚Äã

&gt;And he chuckled, and clucked, ‚ÄúWhat a great Grinchy trick!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúWith this promo poster I have, they‚Äôll know it‚Äôs legit!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúAll I need is a platform‚Ä¶‚Äù The grinch searched around.

&gt;But since the fanbase is large, no new ones were found.

‚Äã

&gt;Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply yelled,

&gt;‚ÄúIf they can post on 4 chan, I‚Äôll make one myself!‚Äù

&gt;So he took out a pan and took up a pad,

&gt;He wrote, and he wrote, the fans won‚Äôt be had!

‚Äã

&gt;Then he added some cuses and some deconfirms too,

&gt;‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no new playable Pokemon, oh no, boo hoo.‚Äù

&gt;Then the Grinch yelled ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs done!‚Äù and so he clicked,

&gt;It was posted online, but soon he was ticked.

‚Äã

&gt;The board remained dark. Quiet posts filled the air.

&gt;All the fans disregarded his post without care.

&gt;He read the replies, of which their were few,

&gt;‚ÄúThis leak is fake! This guy has no clue!‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;He stared at the screen, clenching his fist.

&gt;Translating from French to English was hardly a synch.

&gt;He needed hard evidence, that much was clear.

&gt;But a photo? Too easily faked was his fear.

‚Äã

&gt;He thought and he thunk, about what he should do.

&gt;A video might cost him his job, that much was true.

&gt;‚ÄúThese characters,‚Äù he grinned, ‚Äúthe public must know!‚Äù

&gt;He knew it was time to put on a show.

‚Äã

&gt;He looked round the room, to make sure none could hear,

&gt;And he took out his phone, with much newfound cheer.

&gt;‚ÄúAnd now!‚Äù grinned the Grinch ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put them in a slum!‚Äù

&gt;He took out his phone, then took out his thumb.

‚Äã

&gt;He was swiping through apps, to decide what to use,

&gt;When he heard a loud sound, like the honk of a goose.

&gt;He turned around fast, and he saw the night-watchman,

&gt;It was Jack, oh how he hated this Scotsman.

‚Äã

&gt;The Grinch had been caught by this large man of honor,

&gt;Who‚Äôd seen the light left on, but the Grinch was no goner.

&gt;He started at the Grinch and barked, ‚ÄúOh Eric, why,‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúWhy are you taking pics of this banner? WHY?‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;But you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,

&gt;He thought up a lie and he thought it up quick!

&gt;‚ÄúWhy my sweet old friend Jack,‚Äù the Grinchy Eric lied,

&gt;‚ÄúThere was a rip in this banner messing it up on one side!‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;‚ÄúSo I was asked to stay late and fix it, my dear.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm texting the boss about the new one right here.‚Äù

&gt;And his fib fooled the watchman. Then the Grinch shook his head,

&gt;‚ÄúYou‚Äôre keeping me from my work,‚Äù he said.

‚Äã

&gt;And when Jack the Scotsman went away in a huff,

&gt;The Grinch took out his phone and loaded it up!

&gt;He lined up the evidence onto a desk,

&gt;Opened up snapchat, and thought of something grotesque.

‚Äã

&gt;He started recording the leak right there with his phone,

&gt;Writing ‚Äúfuck you Nintendo lolllll‚Äù now all would be known!

&gt;He sent it along waiting for a response,

&gt;Someone screen-grabbed his snap with no nonchalance.

‚Äã

&gt;It was a quarter past midnight, some fans still in beds,

&gt;With dreams of Shantae and Elma in heads.

&gt;The Grinch he just sat, he sat, and waited.

&gt;Happy with the silence he had soon created.

‚Äã

&gt;Safe and anonymous, thanks to snapchat,

&gt;He‚Äôd surely put an end to speculation chitchat.

&gt;‚ÄúPoohPooh to the fans!‚Äù he was Grinchishly humming.

&gt;‚ÄúThey‚Äôre finding out now no more surprises are coming!‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just waking up! I know what they‚Äôll do!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúTheir mouths will hang open a minute or two,

&gt;Then the fans down in Smashville will all cry boohoo!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a noise,‚Äù Grinned the Grinch, ‚ÄúThat I simply MUST hear!‚Äù

&gt;So he paused. And the Grinch refreshed pages with cheer.

‚Äã

&gt;And he did read some words, flooding into the site.

&gt;It started out light, then his eyes widened in fright.

&gt;The words aren‚Äôt sad! Why, they sounded merry!

&gt;It couldn‚Äôt be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!

‚Äã

&gt;He stared down at Smashville and the Grinch popped his eyes!

&gt;To his core he shook, what he read was a shocking surprise!

&gt;Every fan down in Smashville, both casual and hardcore,

&gt;Were cheering and cheering! With no surprises in store!

‚Äã

&gt;He hadn‚Äôt stopped leaks from coming, they came!

&gt;What‚Äôs worse, he found out, they'd discovered his name!

&gt;And the Grinch, with his grinch-ears ringing with dinging,

&gt;Stood puzzling, and puzzling, ‚ÄúTo what are they clinging?‚Äù

‚Äã

&gt;‚ÄúIt came without Directs! Without trailer posts!

&gt;It came without Sakurai, Reggi, or treehouse live hosts!‚Äù

&gt;And he puzzled and puzzled, till his puzzler was sore.

&gt;Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn‚Äôt before!

‚Äã

&gt;‚ÄúMaybe hyping‚Äù he thought, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt come from fake leaks.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúMaybe hyping‚Ä¶ perhaps‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt something so meek!‚Äù

&gt;And what happened then? Well in Smashville they say,

&gt;Smash Ultimate‚Äôs roster grew three sizes that day.

‚Äã

&gt;And the minute that Sakurai got word of the leak,

&gt;The cheers of his fans kept it from ruining his week.

&gt;The leaks they had come, but it hadn‚Äôt mattered.

&gt;The people were happy, and their hopes were untattered.

‚Äã

&gt;The trailers now could confirm restored hopes and new hype,

&gt;Hype that would keep ringing and dinging each night.Ôªø

"One thing that I'd like to note is that even assuming all the arguments of ""this is complex, therefore it must be designed"" are correct (which they aren't), you cannot go from that claim to claiming that a specific god exist. Not necessarily saying that you do this, because I'm not sure, but it's something a lot of people take for granted. They think that either there are no creator/creators or the specific god that they were raised to believe in exists, which is not the case at all. You could use the same logic to say that the universe was created by a group of 37 purple homosexual penguins and would be just as justified in doing so. Again, I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming that when you say 'god' you just mean that the universe was created by a singular or group of arbitrary intelligent beings, otherwise your claim has just as much validity as my penguin hypothesis. 

And I agree that this discussion likely isn't practical, but that's only because most people are unwilling to change their beliefs on things. I also agree that religious beliefs shouldn't change anybody's actions, however that is sadly not the case, which is one of the reason why I think that discussions like this are at least worth trying.

Regardless of whether or not his motive *was* to spread fascist beliefs and a fascist message, the fact of the matter is that what spread as a result of his actions and statements were fascist beliefs and a fascist message. Sure, he was almost certainly a crazy guy who said crazy shit for gits and shiggles, but you cannot deny that he, inadvertently or not, did a *lot* of publicizing of fascist messages. I mean, fuck, the guy carved a swastika into his head; regardless of whether he's a Nazi or not, there's no way people aren't going to look at what he does or says and not immediately assume ""Nazi.""

All of that being said, I agree that it's important people know what his actual message was (ie, incoherent, unhinged bs), as that weakens the fascist shit. But it's important not to hand-wave the effects of the stuff he said that *was* fascist."

"Sure, its more secure. But its not a night and day kind of difference. Even with no epistemology at all, you have an intuitive idea of how you can know things. So it goes from some arbitrary level of knowledge to a little more, but still not perfect. Philosophy as a distinct field apart from these practices is certainly useful, but its not really as all encompassing as being a basic necessity. You might not be able to describe *how* knowledge works from the ground up, but the practice of fields doesn't require it for your knowledge to be raising. Similar to how you don't really need to be a biologist to be an athlete, since for the latter your biology just kind of works."

People who have certain parts will almost always have the associated brain chemistry to go with those parts. Anything else going on in their brain is due to external factors. Like the simple fact that these transgenders have to take a pill to be what they say they are."

"This is a perfect example of why the military's knee-jerk reaction to any news media attention is always fucking stupid.

You have a guy get sentenced with apparently no evidence, and then additionally since there was such a knee-jerk reaction to the sexual assault coverage (that really only went on for about a year of intense coverage) that people are afraid to do what's right in a case because they know the 'big' Navy won't have their back.

They wonder why so many higher ranked and skilled sailors are getting out. It's just going to get worse because then issues are compounded by the shit stains that stay in, because they have no other choice in life, then they get promoted and become senior enlisted/officers because the bar gets set low because the majority staying in are shit bags.

"&gt;I understand UEFI doesnt play well with a bootable linux at all  
  
This may not entirely be accurate. uefi bios boot only needs a 512MB fat32 formatted partition at the beginning of any storage device it will boot from. When linux install media is created the entire usb stick is a fat32 partition so uefi bios will function as a result.  
  
with that mentioned if you were building a usb stick linux install for uefi creating a minimum of two disk partitions, one for uefi and another for a rootfs as ext4 should suffice to boot a usb stick with uefi active.  
  
If one was using parted to create a uefi compliant partition layout with two partitions and no swap with command console the following console commands would accomplish the preparation steps when invoked in parted shell.

(I end up blowing through tons of insoles and spraying my feet with Lysol on my lunch break because my feet sweat so much, but that's a different gripe). Now that the cold(ish, I live in CA) weather is coming, I will want to be wearing more socks, but the only thing I know that I can do is wear ankle boots. 

What shoes aside from boots, if any, look okay with socks?? Pretty much no heels, right? What about something like this: [https://imgur.com/a/cGJsRYC](https://imgur.com/a/cGJsRYC)? Like, could I wear white socks with those and look okay?

I HAVE tried the little 'invisible' socks that are supposed to stay inside your shoe, but have not found a pair yet that stay fully inside and so it looks stupid and kind of grandma-ish to me, with the little sock edges peeping out. I've also tried wearing nylon socks (like pantyhose) but that's not too comfortable and adds to the foot sweat (ew) thing.

Shoe gurus, share your secrets, please and thank you!"

"Well you certainly seem to be obsessed with my post history. Anyways, some of those things are still in the future, so how am I already wrong on them? And believe it or not, I do admit I can be wrong. Tesla did legitimately made maneuvers needed to get themselves in cash flow positive territory. This keeps the company from going bankrupt in the short run, but likely at huge losses in the future and drastic scaling back of necessary investments going forward.

I guess it's not as bad as I thought, so Tesla lives to see another day. That said, long term, I don't see anything changing, and the challenges just get bigger and bigger.

And if you want a secret agenda from me, it's because I have a small put position against Tesla, so I will make some money in case of a collapse. There's nothing more to it than that."

"Hogan, in America, did very little. Comparatively, Fish‚Äôs skillset is vast, and more impressive in any case. No one really argues that wrestling, work-wise, has stagnates or declined, but we constantly hear how it‚Äôs typically better than it was thirty, forty years ago.

I don‚Äôt care - and neither should you, frankly - how many tickets someone sells. For several reasons. They have differing places on the card, they existed when wrestling was on the opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of popularity, one guy appearing won‚Äôt cause someone to jump up and buy a ticket. There‚Äôs just so many variables and differences that makes the concept of ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù antiquated. Similarly, main event status doesn‚Äôt matter - Roman wasn‚Äôt very popular in his spot, for instance, but Damien Mizdow was the most over guy in the company at one point. Even then, Undisputed Era are over as fuck right now. Titles are probably the least relevant. DiBiase, Jake Roberts, and others never held major titles, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they were any less entertaining. They‚Äôre just props, man.

You come off as quite a grouch who‚Äôs stuck in his ways. B√†lor is a star so long as people see him as a star. Same with Fish, same with Hogan. In a sport where the objective is to make people ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù, in a way, a storyline, absolutely nothing matters except perception."

"I've been really interested in the lore recently, and I've pretty much got it nailed, except one pretty big thing. What actually IS the abyss? I know how it works, who it's corrupted, how it's effected the world, but I still don't get what it is or where it came from. Is it one of those things that's always existed, or was it created? Is it some kind of clashing plane of existence or some spiritual entity?

"Yes but ""knowing"" and ""practiced to the point of non-mistakably-repeatable"" are 2 very different things. BoxBox is so good at riven because he knows every limitation of the champion and knows exactly what he can and can't fight against based on his cooldowns and the knowledge of the champion. Tbh riven isn't any different from any other champ in terms of game knowledge but I'd say she's definitely more knowledge intense than other champions. For a very basic example is Annie, can you one shot the other guy or not. Bruisers and top lane in general always seem to me about very very small micro plays as opposed to any other lane except maybe adc. For example taking one extra step forward in a lane Vs Olaf could cost you a death and 2 waves worth of experience if that one extra step puts you in range of his q to the point where he can run you down and kill you."

"The high maintenance reason is silly though. They consistently make the most reliable cars around. [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/who-makes-the-most-reliable-cars/) published the results of their most recent survey of car model reliability per manufacturer today. Lexus was at the top, followed by Toyota, Mazda, Suburu, Kia, Infinity, Audi, BMW, etc.

It's not even close. Their average reliability is 78 (on a scale of 0-100) while Audi's is 60. German brands consistently beat American brands in reliability but Japanese brands are almost universally the most reliable.

For comparison, Tesla still only has an average reliability score of 32, although the 3 is much higher than the S and X with a score of 49.

This is based on a large survey they do of owners of new cars, using only results of models with a statistically significant number of responses."

"This is great from a manly ""suck it up and do what you have to do"" sort of way. But let's not forget the flip side of that coin that involves connection, compassion, empathy, support, and getting professional help. We all need to some degree both inner strength, and outer support. Together they help us unload our baggage, and better carry it. If you or someone you know is making bad decisions, or is generally miserable and stressed and showing the worst side of ourselves, comfort connect and listen to them or others, and steer them toward/invest yourself in professional counseling. I would say that this aspect of being a human with social needs and getting help probably isn't as represented because it isn't as dynamic from a literary standpoint, but in fact the TV show ""Lucifer"" does exactly that, tells a story around a person working through his problems with therapy and connecting to people.

Or maybe if there‚Äôs an extra counter that counts how long the ad has been on the screen. Maybe then we can hook into the counter and change the required screen time to be 1-5 seconds?

NOTHING in the commercial market had those kinds of numbers.  So I stayed in 1-4 unit land and killed it.  Not to mention, I was intimidated by the larger numbers of dong a commercial deal.  Everything from fees, to permits, to licensing, to taxes .... you name it, it was all big numbers and I found that daunting.

But somewhere along the way it wasn't fun flipping houses anymore and Monday started to feel like Monday.  So, I switched over to commercial.

Holy shit did I make a mistake by staying in residential for so long.  There is simply no comparison.  The raw numbers aren't as good but when you factor in the size of the numbers and the financing involved .... commercial blows away residential and dealing with all those properties scattered across multiple states. 


So to sum up my answer ..... it was too easy to start out on a $12k house than a 100 unit apartment complex and commercial can be scary.  "
"If someone cares for their kids and invests in them for 18 years and does everything they can for them, how is it wrong to expect your kids to take care of you in old age?

I married an Asian man whose family are Chinese immigrants, and the way that most western people think in terms of family and living arrangements is bizarre and illogical compared to other, more conservative cultures.

Western civilisation and East Asian countries are certainly not reproducing enough, even if other countries are.  As a result civilisation is failing.  It's up to people if they don't want children, I'm not going to govern anyone, but at least don't buy into the overpopulation myth and understand the consequences of what will happen to any society with extremely low birth rates.

"As far as doctors go, just go straight to the psych. The specialize in diagnosing mental disorders and medicating them. You wouldn't go to a gynecologist to get a vasectomy right?

The biggest red flag is when the psych wanta to run 'test'. Those are all bullshit. Unless the hook you up to a machine and quantifiably measure the neurotrasmitters in your brain and take baseline MRI's measuring brain activity levels before and after adderall. Other than that every other single test is bullshit, simple because of the mechanism behind ADD and ADHD. 

In short, yes. If you go to one and the don't listen to how this affects you at your job, how it affects your interpersonal relationships, and how it generally affects your QOL. Just thank them, and on to the next.

There's a stigma behind ADD and ADHD because of the select few that use the meds recreationally. But eventually you'll find the right one. If your lucky it'll be the first one you see."

Could do the DC vantage set.  Would be fun to have a merged and bad ass Calvary unit. 

Eirika: 
Love her and always wanted to build her. Would probably make a team based around her weapon with tactics skills. Maybe Titania or L! Lyn for my green? Titania would be nice to stack 3 tactics on at once and Lyn has the sought after speed tactic. 

Laevetain:
Have 3 possible merges for her and would run a similar dc/vantage as ares. Unsure if her blade blade would be more advantageous than his constant special proc though. Also, harder to merge. 

A! Tiki:
I‚Äôve got an unmerged 5* with steady/aether but I don‚Äôt love her. She is +def -spd. Would consider going with her refined prf and dc with wrath or guard? I could run her with another dragon of another color too.

"For me it was depression - I ate because I felt so low the more I ate the bigger I got the more I felt low because of how big I was getting 

Mine was PND and I ballooned whilst pregnant (had complications like lots of additional amniotic fluid which made me feel huge so I ate more because I was big anyway

I just didn't want to do anything but eat and cry and lay in bed. I had no interest in my child at all and would breastfeed with as little as possible of him touching me then give him back to his dad to deal with. Then I would just eat some more. Takeaways being delivered massive grocery shops being delivered I didn't have to go anywhere to get food. I wouldn't drink anything other than soda. I punished myself with is. I went from 10 stone pre pregnancy weight to almost 30 stone by the time I started coming out of it. I wore leggings and massive jumpers whenever I did get dressed which was rare. My family and partner tried to help but I would become hysterical and literally injure myself if I didn't get what I wanted. 

We were so poor and I spent everything on food. We went weeks having a loaf of bread between my partner and I and I would eat it in one sitting. I took out payday loans and doorstep loans to be able to binge. 

I'm still above 20 stone 10 years later. The main reason why is the fear of what happens if I lose the weight. I will never be able to afford the skin surgery and because I got so big so fast all the skin elasticity has gone and it won't shrink back down with me. I can't face putting the hardwork in just for it all to make me feel worse. I am currently on the break up diet and have lost 2 dress sizes in 2 months but that's because I have 0 appetite. 

I am happy and sexy and confident the way I am and the fear of the unknown is stronger to me than the fear of staying overweight "

"I would say whichever you choose, go for the plus model, as it has better hardware. Both G5+ and G5S+ are viable, practically no difference in performance, only slight difference in design (G5s+ has full aluminum body, whereas G5+ has plastic around the edges). Also someone noted the camera in the G5+ model takes slightly better pictures, though it is a single one so it lacks some features that the dual camera of  the G5S+ (Depth of field mode, ARCore support). Overall both solid choices for midrange phones."

"The tension meter on the phallosan is not very accurate.  I used a hanging scale to calibrate mine and found it was pulling significantly less than the manufacturer claimed.  I did gain with it but I found that I only gained when it was pulling hard enough that it was difficult to complete the desired time.  So if it feels too comfortable I would be skeptical that there is much weight.

I have since converted it to a hanger just by removing the belt and the clip and attaching a loop of metal wire around the bell.

"People are pattern seeking creatures.  A good thing about us.
But we would also prefer any explanation, to no explanation at all.  A bad thing about us.

Religion is our first attempt at philosophy, natural science, and health care.  Unfortunately, because it was our first attempt it was also our worst attempt.

Nowadays, people are afraid of death, and also afraid of not knowing how to anchor their morality without their gods.  

(There are counter arguments which address all of these issues and allow you to lead an ethical meaningful life without religion.)  ...but religion is profoundly manipulative, with circular tautological arguments, which prey on our primal fears.

Hence it's staying power.  It's humanity's oldest toy, one that we're unlikely to give up anytime soon.    

Even if you've emancipated yourself from religious thinking, it's a fascinating topic, and worth discussing."

"Travis has played this particular aspect of Fjord quite brilliantly in my opinion. There is no doubt the Fjord is probably the most openly altruistic, especially with how he tries ti help people whom he doesn't have to, e.g. the Knights of Zadash, the children in hupperdook, and others. However there is no denying that Fjord also feels some interest in power. Fjord has been asked multiple times by others, but he has stated that he doesn't necessarily want to get rid of the power, but rather try to understand it.

It is something confirmed in-game and in Talks, that Fjord is a person who never had much power growing up. However these new powers he has allows him to maybe affect the world according to his whims. Fjord has also acknowledged how power changes him, how he becomes more reliant on it to solve his problems.

It paints a picture of power being something incredibly addictive, or at least has a great allure. Ultimately it will be up to Travis to decide how he plays this. Fjord will either succumb to the allure and maybe choose power, which could lead to a huge character shift. Or he will move beyond it, and say that he will not.

Hi there. I wanted to share my story with you. I'm 33 and 3 years ago I had weight loss surgery. I was 400lbs and at my lowest i weight 265. I am currently 290. I hate that I cant lose the rest of the weight. For most of my life I've felt ugly even when I started losing weight i still felt ugly. When I hit 265 I thought magically I would feel handsome but I didnt. Then for 2 years I slowly gained that extra 25 lbs. There are days that I feel ugly and there are days that I dont feel as ugly. Something I learned... everyone has days when they feel ugly and thats ok but that doesnt mean you can't love yourself. Be proud of yourself and your achievements. If you ever need to talk message me.
As far as I saw: Grindr and Craigslist. And go to bars in Le Village.

"&gt; well first off, your title seems extremely narcissistic. (especially considering how few people posted about you, regardless some people are nasty people, and I apologize on behalf of them.) So you're probably going to be starting off on a negative note here.

The title was meant to be a bit jokey, but I know my British humor sometimes does not translate well

&gt; Secondly; we know you don't like oculus. However I think most of the negativity comes from the fact that some new people come here and you tend to skew the pros and cons in Vive's favor. At the very least you should tell people you don't own a Rift and why, but let people who actually own the system talk about technical stuff like tracking, etc.

I don't really have many issues with Oculus or even Facebook, it''s just the locked ecosystem I have issues with, also I can only give my views on things and sometimes it different that others and I do mention that I own a Vive

&gt; I see your argument for a locked ecosystem; i've agreed with you many times. However as I've said many times, Oculus/Facebook paid for these games to be made, they should have the right to restrict them to their storefront (in the same way Valve should be able to restrict their games to their storefront) because without them, we simply wouldn't have these great games. I do wish they would natively allow headsets other than the Pimax to run their software though.

We all have different view points on locked ecosystems, it might be best for me at the moment to not talk bout that :)

&gt; And I'm sure you know that the Rift 2 isn't cancelled, they just chose to go with a different design. Hopefully you haven't been telling people the former.

I've not kept up with the developments of the Rift 2, but if it's not been canceled that good news

Think this NCAA will do what it does and I think this case verdict will be more useful when the Universities sue the NCAA if they feel they over-step.  Based on how slow the NCAA has moved in the past, this might take a few years to wrap up."

"aaaaactually in some cases it's worse than nothing, basically if you have armour that's not actually thick enough to stop shells, all it's gonna do is increase shrapnelling, say an APFSDS shell gets fired at this thing (hypothetically, a HMG would probably have the same effect).

The headphones isolate the ambient noise which you need to be aware of as a driver. The whole point of a car horn is to notify other drivers of hazards. Having headphones in means you are less likely to hear the horns. You're also less likely to hear engine noise of cars which may be in blind spots and other ambient noises like sirens from emergency services. In general the headphones restrict your situational awareness. The consequences may not be as severe compared to someone wearing headphones on a bicycle but the reasons why it's considered dangerous are the same.

"Holy shit, that is exactly my story. I have the exact same anxiety problems, constantly wondering if I'm ok physically and just not being able to get out of my own head. It's hell. I started using cbd flower two weeks ago and I feel amazing. The anxiety is still there  but compared to before its so easily manageable with cbd. I tried tinctures and edibles in the past to little effect, but as soon as I started smoking the flower I immediately felt the results. Not only is my anxiety almost gone, but alot of the weird random pains (which of course led to anxiety attacks) have disappeared, making me suspect they were psychsomatic, which has in turn helped my anxiety that much more. I thought I was going to feel like that forever. Im so happy you found relief as well!"

"&gt;AFAIK, the culture was that teachers would discipline and teach this aspect of life to the students

Which makes sense with the ""missing"" (excess overtime) fathers and growing number of double-income families, but while families are handing over their kids to schools and academies, they refuse to hand over the right to discipline, or even cooperate with the teachers to issue it on their own. Naturally the PTA runs the schools and the customers run the hagwon, so parents' ""cake and eat it too"" obsession is resulting in children becoming orphaned of authority."

"&gt; Not sure why cheating seems to be frequently described as hard to do

Well, I'm having regular sex outside my marriage, and the pool of women interested in FWB with a married man is substantially smaller than the pool of women interested in dating that same man were he divorced. I'm 38; I'm way above average looks wise, and I've found interested women but it would be way easier if I wasn't married. Maybe when I'm 50 the pool of women who still are trying to get a last-minute marriage and biological kids will fall away and all the women will be looking for sex. I don't know. Ask me in 12 years.

So that's one reason.

Also, a lot of men literally try one thing to meet a woman. They'll go do online dating, get chirping crickets, and conclude it is impossible. Women get deluged with attention online dating, and they have to try to find quality while being bombarded with quantity. If you're a man, you're honest best bet is to turn off your computer and talk to women, in-person, out in public. That's how I found FWB and most of the women I dated while married. When you're a put-together man who actually approaches a woman, sincerely and openly, you *do* stand out from the crowd. I did land a few first dates from the websites, but it was a low return on investment, and none of them went as well as the situations where I started with flirting and gauged interest organically.

Another reason is it's just plain more complicated. The way I do it, FWB is solidly in second place for my time and attention, but I can see how people can get carried away with lovey dovey feelings, especially in the early days of a relationship. I also have a very-low-maintenance FWB partner, but not all people will tolerate being second place to a primary relationship."

"I think I discovered something between 1080p vs 720p webrip encodes. Most people a were raving about 720p encodes which seemed to be better quality. I thought 720p is reduced in resolution so how could that be better. Well it might be partially true.

I've downloaded Daredevil season-3 encodes in 720p just to watch the show on mobile before downloading the 1080p for archiving.

I believe the 720 encodes have extra despeckle/denoise filter apllied. So it looks more clean and sharper. Whereas the 1080p seems a lot noisier. It doesn't mean the 720p are better. It means the 1080p webrips perhaps didn't use the same denoise filter. If this same filter were used at 1080p the results would have been far superior than 720p AND have a lower filesize per because it is smoother (which is easier to sompress). Webrips are about 3.6gb per episode which is too much imo.

My question is can anyone confirm this and if known what filter or setting is used by x264 for 720p encodes This is consistent with all tv shows I seen. Ie. Ash vs Evil 1080p vs 720p to verify."

"To get a permanent residence permit, you will need to reside on a temporary permit for 4 years: https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-obtain-a-Polish-permanent-residency

In practice this means that you are looking at (without marriage) a minimum of 7 years before you can naturalize: http://www.migrant.info.pl/how-to-obtain-polish-citizenship.html

serious question though: do you actually not know what antifa stands for? I mean I know what the fox news narrative of them is.... pretty much what you describe to a T.  but, if you are seriously in the dark on this one, they are Anti-Fascists....

in case that's not clear, fascism is a BAD thing. so antifa is anti-that (their methods are brutish but so are a lot of extremist wing groups).... but they don't fucking kill people and they aren't racists who repress people based on the color of their skin... NOT even close to the same

"Good point about Jayce.

Autumn actually wasn't impulsive as a human. The death of the few humans she's killed were calculated decisions (not just impulses). Basically self-defense turned homicide.

As a werewolf, being impulsive is a part of the experience of being new, which is something both Jayce and Tristan warned her about in the last few parts (and were concerned about her being in public right now).

The meth-head was in a homicidal/suicidal state where he wanted to exert control and inflict harm (not something I discussed in the short-story version because I had the scene only one part, whereas it might have lasted longer if it was in a book). In his current state, he probably would have killed most everyone else eventually just to feel like he was in control (god-complex). I'm not mentioning that to make any type of point, but just explaining a little more about the situation in general. That was just that backdrop of his character when I was writing the scene."

"&gt;2 things to note, if you have at least half the required stats to use wield the weapon, you can 2 hand it and use it effectively, but ONLY while 2 handed.

I need to clarify and correct something for you here and to make sure /u/Groggy_Doggy has the right intel on this matter. 

The 2 hand ability is **specifically restricted to the strength stat on weapons and shields**. So, if you don't have enough dex for a weapon, it doesn't matter how many hands you use. 

Also, the rule of its use is that it increases your base strength by 50%. So, the true math here is that you need a minimum of 67% of the required strength stat to 2 hand a weapon. 

Example: Using the BKS you have here, it requires 20 STR. So, in order to use it, you need at least 14 STR. Half of which is 7 STR, making your 2 handed strength stat effectively 21 STR. Because at 13, half of that is 6.5, making your effective 2 hand strength 19.5, which is just shy of the requirement and they won't round up for you. 

And another useful tip, you can still use a 2 handed sword as a shield, but not to parry. The damage reduction is much lower, but you can at least still play a little defensively."

"I joined several army spouse pages trying to make some friends. Here's a wild one for ya. (GA, USA)

So I met this wife, her name is Rachel, on Friday night. I took my husband with me for safety reasons and because she has a cat, and my husband (Noah) loves them. It's all good and well, we're playing cards, having a good time, drinking. And then out of absolutely fucking nowhere she starts talking about some pretty gnarly stuff from her past, abuse, neglect the whole 9 yards. I keep my cool and give her advice. She agrees to sell us a bed set as well (before she was drunk). Then suddenly she's transgender and has cancer (both of which are very obviously lies) and tells us she only has 2 weeks left to live. Which went on for like 4 hours, and she kept grabbing my boobs and bum, and sitting on my husband, but lil ole me is polite and says nothing, maybe she is just crazy when she's drunk. We leave about 6 am Saturday morning so we can get some rest and hit the yard sales, mattress set in tow. At like 8 I messaged her and said we would bring the money that afternoon. She said ok. She calls me at 1 FREAKING OUT and told me to tell the MPs we agreed to buy the mattress set. Um ok... And says some lady was taking stuff out of her house. I just hung up. I told Noah let's just swing by, give her the money, and be done because I can't handle this. So we go over and knock, no one is there. Her neighbors come out and tell us she put some stuff with their yard sale, still drinking until like noon, got blackout drunk and passed out in the yard so they took her inside and started to take her things into her house at which point she woke up and called the MPs. She then barricaded herself in her house and had a whole fucking meltdown and they hauled her off to the hospital. She's definitely in a psych ward because I haven't heard anything from her since. I'm still like what the actual hell. Oh and she's 100% an alcoholic and has a breathlock in her car."

"Yep. My theory (not the only one nor the first) is that they are intentionally tanking the project or even faking failure on YT in order to increase views and $$$. They are laughing all way to the bank. They slow walk the YT content because the business model rewards that. Instagram posts are closer to real time because that‚Äôs a different business model. They have figured out that the way to make 8 roofing videos instead of 1 is to fake mistakes and incompetence so that the haters will hate and the leghumpers will hump, but everyone still watches. If they were embarrassed and worried about saving face they would just edit those parts out. I am starting to think that they are more corrupt and dishonest than they are stupid.

"Can‚Äôt go wrong with any of those! Great choices you are looking at.

As for Horizon, Bloodborne and Odyssey, I think the safest bet is Horizon first. It‚Äôs got one of the most beautiful looking worlds, has very fun and quite unique combat/enemies, and a really good story. 

Bloodborne is incredible, but it‚Äôs basically a faster paced, more offense-based Dark Souls game so it‚Äôs definitely not for everyone. If you like challenging games though, I think it‚Äôs worth at least trying either Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne at some point. If you end up liking that style of game, you will love them.

And Assassin‚Äôs Creed: Odyssey is amazing, but it can be extremely grindy which is also not everyone‚Äôs thing. But it has one of the biggest worlds I‚Äôve played in, and TONS of stuff to do. Also, the combat is really fun, and much more involved than some of the other AC games. "

Got it
"\&gt;   education and skill 

Skill perhaps.  Most are good at manipulating people which could lead to being a successful CEO or salesperson.  Certainly some could be the next Tony Robbins were they of a secular inclination.  However, certainly not education.  Most pastors have a MA or PhD in a liberal arts field with little commercial application.  Their education pretty much qualifies them to teach at a college or ask if you want venti or grande, although I suppose it might help you get into law school.

\&gt;  So why would someone ever want to be a preacher? They feel a call from God

Some do, certainly.  I have met many preachers who are strong men of God who have sacrificed a lot to do it.  However, something that I have noticed of most of them is that they had some manner of previous career and then left it because they felt God calling them.  The kids who go to Bible college then straight to seminary?  I suppose some have been called but I suspect for most it was just a career that would please their parents/earn them a lot of positive reinforcement and that they felt academically capable of achieving.   In Bible colleges, it is also a better way of meeting girls than being on the football team.  They are the ones that I see trying to ""climb the ladder"" the same way that those in the secular world do.  My dad always used to say that he had never met a preacher that was ""called"" to a lower paying church.  Now, in adulthood I have met a few, but they're rare.

&amp;#x200B;

For what its worth, I think the current ""free market"" approach to pastors in evangelical circles is a terrible scourge on God's people because it has all sorts of negative secondary effects.  Either adopt a system like some of the more mainline denominations where preachers are appointed (with congregation input) and paid a set salary based on education and experience, or do what the early church did and appoint the most Godly people within the congregation to teach and lead.  Churches need paid accountants but they don't absolutely need paid pastors.

I guess its also worth pointing out that most of the super rich pastors made their money writing books (although obviously being a well known pastor helps you sell those books)."

"Hold up now, there's three things here I would like to address. First, there is no blanket correct statement for how tires should be rotated based on tread wear as different cars and drivers have different needs. 

Second, most cars will wear the front tires out first as they are the steering wheels, bear most of the weight, and in a lot of applications are drive wheels as well. If we follow your ""most tread in the rear"" then tires would never be rotated. 

Lastly, the new tires in the rear is not so much for hydroplaning as it is to prevent oversteer, especially on wet roads, since there is less weight in the back. The thing about that is if this is a huge concern for someone, then they really should be buying all 4. If one axle is low on tread, your two choices are oversteer or understeer depending on which axle has the shit tires.

"Here's what it said:

&gt; Every fan down in Smashville liked hype a lot‚Ä¶

&gt;But the Grinch, who lived somewhere in France, DID NOT!

&gt;The Grinch hated hype-ing! The whole pre-release season!

&gt;Now please don‚Äôt ask why. No one quite knows the reason.

‚Äã

It could be he was sick of all the fake leaks.

It could be, perhaps, he could not wait 6 weeks.

But I think that the most likely reason of all,

Was he knew Verg‚Äôs roster was two sizes too small.

‚Äã

Whatever the reason, the size or the wait,

He stood there on Wednesday, ready for hate.

Staring down at the banner with a sour, Grinchy frown,

At unreleased characters ‚Äì shit‚Äôs about to go down.

‚Äã

For he knew every fan down in Smashville online,

Were caught in a drought, just passing the time.

‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôre talking about Skull Kid!‚Äù He snarled with a sneer,

‚ÄúNext month is Ultimate! It‚Äôs practically here!‚Äù

‚Äã

Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously humming,

‚ÄúI must tell them somehow, they won‚Äôt see it coming!‚Äù

For each day he knew all the smash boys and smash girls,

Would cling to new leaks, it might make him hurl.

‚Äã

And then! Oh, the posts! Oh, the posts!

Posts! Posts! Posts!

That‚Äôs one thing he hated! The posts!

POSTS! POSTS! POSTS!

‚Äã

Then the fans young and old would talk and they‚Äôd guess.

And they‚Äôd guess! And they‚Äôd guess! And they‚Äôd GUESS!

GUESS! GUESS! GUESS!

‚Äã

They would guess there‚Äôd be Waddle Dee, and Minecraft‚Äôs own Steve.

Which was something the Grinch couldn‚Äôt stand to conceive.

And then they‚Äôd do something he liked least of all!

Every fan down in Smashville, the tall and the small,

‚Äã

Would all come together, like fish on a string.

Having taken the bait, oh to the threads they would cling!

His phone would ding! It would ding! It would Ding!

DING! DING! DING!

‚Äã

And the more the Grinch listened to his phone go ring ding,

The more the Grinch thought, ‚ÄúI must stop this whole thing!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, for 231 days I‚Äôve put up with it now!‚Äù

‚ÄúI must stop these fake leaks from coming! But how?‚Äù

‚Äã

Then he got an idea! An awful idea!

THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFULLY AWFUL IDEA!

‚ÄúI know just what to do!‚Äù The Grinch laughed in his throat.

And he broke out his laptop and started to gloat.

‚Äã

And he chuckled, and clucked, ‚ÄúWhat a great Grinchy trick!‚Äù

‚ÄúWith this promo poster I have, they‚Äôll know it‚Äôs legit!‚Äù

‚ÄúAll I need is a platform‚Ä¶‚Äù The grinch searched around.

But since the fanbase is large, no new ones were found.

‚Äã

Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply yelled,

‚ÄúIf they can post on 4 chan, I‚Äôll make one myself!‚Äù

So he took out a pan and took up a pad,

He wrote, and he wrote, the fans won‚Äôt be had!

‚Äã

Then he added some cuses and some deconfirms too,

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no new playable Pokemon, oh no, boo hoo.‚Äù

Then the Grinch yelled ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs done!‚Äù and so he clicked,

It was posted online, but soon he was ticked.

‚Äã

The board remained dark. Quiet posts filled the air.

All the fans disregarded his post without care.

He read the replies, of which their were few,

‚ÄúThis leak is fake! This guy has no clue!‚Äù

‚Äã

He stared at the screen, clenching his fist.

Translating from French to English was hardly a synch.

He needed hard evidence, that much was clear.

But a photo? Too easily faked was his fear.

‚Äã

He thought and he thunk, about what he should do.

A video might cost him his job, that much was true.

‚ÄúThese characters,‚Äù he grinned, ‚Äúthe public must know!‚Äù

He knew it was time to put on a show.

‚Äã

He looked round the room, to make sure none could hear,

And he took out his phone, with much newfound cheer.

‚ÄúAnd now!‚Äù grinned the Grinch ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put them in a slum!‚Äù

He took out his phone, then took out his thumb.

‚Äã

He was swiping through apps, to decide what to use,

When he heard a loud sound, like the honk of a goose.

He turned around fast, and he saw the night-watchman,

It was Jack, oh how he hated this Scotsman.

‚Äã

The Grinch had been caught by this large man of honor,

Who‚Äôd seen the light left on, but the Grinch was no goner.

He started at the Grinch and barked, ‚ÄúOh Eric, why,‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you taking pics of this banner? WHY?‚Äù

‚Äã

But you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,

He thought up a lie and he thought it up quick!

‚ÄúWhy my sweet old friend Jack,‚Äù the Grinchy Eric lied,

‚ÄúThere was a rip in this banner messing it up on one side!‚Äù

‚Äã

‚ÄúSo I was asked to stay late and fix it, my dear.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm texting the boss about the new one right here.‚Äù

And his fib fooled the watchman. Then the Grinch shook his head,

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre keeping me from my work,‚Äù he said.

‚Äã

And when Jack the Scotsman went away in a huff,

The Grinch took out his phone and loaded it up!

He lined up the evidence onto a desk,

Opened up snapchat, and thought of something grotesque.

‚Äã

He started recording the leak right there with his phone,

Writing ‚Äúfuck you Nintendo lolllll‚Äù now all would be known!

He sent it along waiting for a response,

Someone screen-grabbed his snap with no nonchalance.

‚Äã

It was a quarter past midnight, some fans still in beds,

With dreams of Shantae and Elma in heads.

The Grinch he just sat, he sat, and waited.

Happy with the silence he had soon created.

‚Äã

Safe and anonymous, thanks to snapchat,

He‚Äôd surely put an end to speculation chitchat.

‚ÄúPoohPooh to the fans!‚Äù he was Grinchishly humming.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre finding out now no more surprises are coming!‚Äù

‚Äã

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just waking up! I know what they‚Äôll do!‚Äù

‚ÄúTheir mouths will hang open a minute or two,

Then the fans down in Smashville will all cry boohoo!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a noise,‚Äù Grinned the Grinch, ‚ÄúThat I simply MUST hear!‚Äù

So he paused. And the Grinch refreshed pages with cheer.

‚Äã

And he did read some words, flooding into the site.

It started out light, then his eyes widened in fright.

The words aren‚Äôt sad! Why, they sounded merry!

It couldn‚Äôt be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!

‚Äã

He stared down at Smashville and the Grinch popped his eyes!

To his core he shook, what he read was a shocking surprise!

Every fan down in Smashville, both casual and hardcore,

Were cheering and cheering! With no surprises in store!

‚Äã

He hadn‚Äôt stopped leaks from coming, they came!

What‚Äôs worse, he found out, they'd discovered his name!

And the Grinch, with his grinch-ears ringing with dinging,

Stood puzzling, and puzzling, ‚ÄúTo what are they clinging?‚Äù

‚Äã

‚ÄúIt came without Directs! Without trailer posts!

It came without Sakurai, Reggi, or treehouse live hosts!‚Äù

And he puzzled and puzzled, till his puzzler was sore.

Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn‚Äôt before!

‚Äã

‚ÄúMaybe hyping‚Äù he thought, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt come from fake leaks.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe hyping‚Ä¶ perhaps‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt something so meek!‚Äù

And what happened then? Well in Smashville they say,

Smash Ultimate‚Äôs roster grew three sizes that day.

‚Äã

And the minute that Sakurai got word of the leak,

The cheers of his fans kept it from ruining his week.

The leaks they had come, but it hadn‚Äôt mattered.

The people were happy, and their hopes were untattered.

‚Äã

The trailers now could confirm restored hopes and new hype,

Hype that would keep ringing and dinging each night.Ôªø

"\&gt;If he was truly fired for being punched in the face.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually, he was 4 minutes late on Wednesday, that's why they fired him. Unless the employee can prove otherwise, it likely isn't in their best interest to try to take it to court, especially at such a low level, when lawsuits can be timely and costly. Many people do have recourse, and many people who should have recourse, do not. This is also along the lines of a gas station job. For most other jobs, I would recommend it, but a corporate gas station is going to know where the line is, and how not to cross it. Time is also another thing. Someone surviving on a minimum wage job likely doesn't have time for an arduous court case that likely won't be successful. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are prepared and knowledgable before you are fired, you can take steps to increase your chances, certainly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does OP have his personnel file claiming he was fired for being punched in the face? Unlikely. If there were witnesses to the event and his firing, that can be potentially helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless my initial comment was meant to imply that OP may not have the means, or the time/knowledge. Most people probably think they can be fired for basically any reason. In some places that is true. Company policy may have the company covered with a document OP signed upon being hired. Which goes to further my point - the victim in this case may be unknowledgable about how to win the wrongful termination case, but the company certainly is not, and it is likely something they've dealt with before. Just a simple search shows me \[this isn't the first time something like this has happened\]([https://fox6now.com/2014/05/01/robbed-of-a-job-why-would-speedway-fire-its-overnight-clerk-after-hes-robbed-at-gunpoint/](https://fox6now.com/2014/05/01/robbed-of-a-job-why-would-speedway-fire-its-overnight-clerk-after-hes-robbed-at-gunpoint/)) and in that case, they would have been covered, as it's likely company policy not to keep that much money in your drawer. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, yes, you could get fired from your minimum wage job, and you could consult a lawyer, and you could find one who will do free consults and work for a contingent fee, and you could go up against a  team of lawyers from a corporation worth several tens of billions of dollars, and you could win lost wages from your minimum paying job. 

&amp;#x200B;

They've also successfully won \[wrongful termination\]([https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-6th-circuit/1319561.html](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-6th-circuit/1319561.html)) cases in the past. That one was for unpaid wages, which is both easier to prove and more substantial than being the victim of a robbery. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would hope anyone seeking law advice is not going to get everything they know from one random comment on reddit, and treats these things as a case by case basis. I do not think this is case OP would have won, however."

"So if I'm not mistaken, the spin they are referring to is actually from orbital angular momentum, not spin angular momentum. Spin angular momentum is angular momentum caused by circular polarization. On the other hand, orbital angular momentum is angular momentum that is caused by a helical wavefront (compared to a typical Gaussian beam with a planar wavefront). There are several papers that talk about these OAM beams, one type is called a Laguerre-Gaussian beam, and the amount of twist that they can carry is theoretically infinite. Practically speaking, the divergence and therefore the size of the beam increases with the degree of twisting, so I believe the fiber can help contain these beams a little better than say free-space propagation. 

**Edit:** Also to answer your other questions, yes the spins are quantized at the single photon level. But interestingly it seems like you can get non-quantized angular momentums when you have normal amounts of photons. To go into further detail on OAM, the angular momentum in a single photon is proportional to the speed of the rotation. If we call the quantized rotation m, basically the wavefront is rotating (it sort of looks like a fusilli pasta) m times over one wavelength, and interestingly enough no one has found a limit to m.

Sure, IF the parents are shtupping some other kid's parents, then other kids may know about it and be talking about it, but that's a pretty big if!

It's *way* more likely that the kid himself suspects something than that some other teenager is stalking the OP and drawing conclusions. But without more information we wouldn't know. 

Like, if the parents are fighting all the time and dad is sleeping on teh couch when he isn't storming out of hte ouse late at night, then yeah, teenager probably suspects.  But we don't know that anything of the sort is happening."

"first of all i'd really recommend you give your pc an actual, physical cleaning - open it up, take outside and spray out all the dust with a compressed air can.

i'd run windows defender for a virus scan, and malware bytes if i'm really concerned.  

i'd use task manager again to monitor what programs are using the most resources (disk, cpu and memory), see if i can tweak anything there.

When that car started moving you could see the cars ahead of them moving too so you should have known that there would be enough room for you to clear the intersection - as evidenced by the one car cutting in front of you and still leaving room for you and dickweed had you not gunned it to try and cut him off.

Attraction is usually the first step in a relationship then they grow from there it's a shitty relationship if the entire thing is based off just looks.

"Not how it works. Just about every bottled water contains minerals in it. It's how they get the water to taste a certain way.

The only water that would take minerals from your body is distilled, deionized or ultrapure water. Distilled is entirely negligible in this aspect. De-ionized water would take a bit of mineral content from your gut but is easily counteracted by any salt, sugar or mineral intake.  And you will never find ultrapure water in stores (it's only real use it to wash electronic components). If you did drink it it could remove a significant amount of mineral content from your body, but you would have to drink a significant amount for the effect to be noticeable and again, you're not going to find it in any regular store.

In general, any food you eat combined with the mineral content already present in most drinking water will be enough for you body's needs."

When I went home last week, i gained like 10 pounds in a week. This week I went back to campus and I only eat one meal a day, and my weight is suddenly dropping a lot. 


So for a person my height, or even shorter being super duper skinny like that? Do you only eat like 500 calories every 2 days or something?"

He gets credit for an economy that Generation X built.

And he persisted to push the war on drugs (aka the war on poor/ black communities). If you don't agree, then why have you never seen drug busts on Rodeo Drive? Why no SWAT operations in the Hamptons? Why is 5th Ave devoid of DEA operatives busting down doors and shoving guns in the faces of old, white women drinking chardonnay?  Don't tell me drugs aren't in those communities.

This doesn't even bring about the Whitewater garbage. All of these things are crimes against the people of the USA.

"I'm not OP, but I did fully recover from an eating disorder that involved binging and calorie counting and now eat 100% intuitively.

The way I made the transition was, like OP said, not tracking at all. But I borrowed Overeater's Anonymous's and my ED counselor's advice for what ""sane"" eating looks like and kept a food journal.

Basically, to consider yourself ""on track"" sans calorie counting, you eat 3 meals a day with no snacks. Each meal should contain just enough food to get you to the next meal without starving. Your plate should generally be 50% vegetable matter, 25% protein, and 25% starch. If you find yourself needing to snack, eat bigger meals. Sugar is not a food; don't eat desserts most days.

By doing this, I achieved intuitive eating AND a slim figure that feels effortless thanks to it being habit and not a weight loss attempt. If you view it as a weight loss attempt it's more exhausting I think.

Do this long enough and it will sink in eventually. 6 months. A year. Then for the rest of your life.

Somedays I have to pinch myself because I still can't believe I lost the weight obsession after so many years of struggling. I suffered hardcore for 4 years, then spent another 4 years on a relapse roller coaster which ended when I got very serious about this plan. 

Also, cook for yourself from scratch like 2-5 days/week.

Edit: I know this means nothing, but for what it's worth I do have an NSCA CSCS certification which is for athletic training. Got it last year in hopes of helping people avoid the path I took."

Honestly if a boyfriend told me not to do things that might make him mad, that would be the last time he ever heard from me.

"&gt;Not everyone has the initial emotional reaction as we would like. It is their concrete actions and later emotions, having had time to process, that really matter.

I think this is a really important lesson to absorb for long-term relationships. Obviously if someone keeps making the same mistakes over and over that is also not okay, but giving yourself and your partner space to process can make things so much better. 

It can be hard to not have a knee-jerk reaction sometimes, and sometimes you can accidentally stumble onto sore spots without realizing it. Not everyone can behave perfectly 100% of the time, it's the steps someone takes to resolve the problem and make sure it doesn't happen again that matters most.

"I figured. I noticed they seem to just head straight for the player (ignoring the flocking) but then the way some of them changed directions when moving around the obstacles made it clear that there was some pathfinding going on, as well.

I don't know if this would be of any use to you, but I was working on a simple dungeon crawler in Love2D (Lua), and I had a neat trick to minimize the number of searches needed for an arbitrary number of enemies. What I was doing was running a breadth-first search from the position of the player every time they changed tiles, and for every tile I would store:  
- The direction to the previous tile in the search  
- The distance from the starting tile  

So basically any enemy would just need to look at those two things for the tile they are standing on to figure out if they were within range of the player, and to know what direction to chase them in.

I would never be able to find the video, but it was inspired by a video done by the creators of Planetary Annihilation talking about their own algorithm for optimizing path-finding for massive numbers of enemies."

"Grappling doesn't necessarily mean that you are holding onto the opponents arms. If you have someone in a headlock, that's still considered grappled and you have full use of their hands. If you have someone's legs wrapped up, they are considered grappled and still have full use their hands. RAW grappled just reduces your speed to 0.

With that being said, Rule 0 means that the DM can override anything like this."

Shadow of Mordor please. I am a huge LOTR fan and I think I'd really love this game. I have seen its review and the combat system and the game design looks really awesome to me.
I played a couple games on PSNow including Bloodborne. I know its not ideal but I was able to play most games perfectly fine through the service but Bloodborne was the one game I just couldnt get through because of its performance. The frame rate drops instantly turned me away from the game and I feel like even with a ps4 I'd feel similar. 
"Each state has the ability to set their own rules and regulations regarding their voting machines.  Machines in my home state of Minnesota are all electronic, and the rules were set by the DFL led commission in charge of setting them up (under the 89th Legislature.)

"Think of it this way, you can paint perfectly fine on a normal piece of A4 paper, but if you're at all serious about painting, you'd probably go for more specialised paper or even canvas.

Same thing with Origami, printer paper works fine to a degree, but after a while you start to realise they have a lot of limitations, size being just one of many."

\- Iron Supplement pills-- Not only will it be good for you, but they also leave the taste of blood in your mouth...  
\- Give your partner a hickey (with consent of course), this helps not just because it can taste slightly like blood if you suck and bite, but also because if you do it right, it leaves a gorgeous red bruise 

Otherwise:

"I mean first of all it isn't an essential part of the game. The last MLD card that got printed was [[Fall of the Tharn]] and that only got made because it's a throw back. The next one after that got printed like, 5-6 years ago as an Ajani ultimate? It is absolutely not an integral part of the game.

Also math discounts your point. The average edh deck has 37-36 land cards, you are always going to draw more nonland cards then you are land cards, even if your deck is themed around lands so not only is MLD going to make more of your top decks bad, but if I draw one card after a normal board wipe I can feel like i'm playing the game, I need to draw 3-6 lands depending on the deck to feel like i'm playing again.

But actually none of this matters because casual EDH is about having fun. It is irrelivant what the ""right"" way to play is, the only question that matters is are people having fun? If no then there is a problem. You can't make people enjoy MLD, you can't make people see it's benefits or not hate it. Just accept that the majority of people don't like it and for the people that do accept it it should only be used as a protection spell just before you go off."

Then he started planning his studies and whole future to be compatible with mine the second day I knew him (we were only in the first year of uni) and started treating me as his manic pixie dream girl. Still,maybe he's just socially awkward and desperate for friends, right?? Nope. We were flatmates doing similar degrees so we were around each other a lot. After a whole evening of sighing he finally says that he's sad that his friends make fun of him for being single. I try to steer the conversation away from that topic but he continues in this mopey voice, looking up at me with what I assume to be an attempt at puppy eyes. ""Are you single?""

This is not the same as the Obama policies. And I'm really surprised you are trying to make that argument.

"Logically do you think it would be a good idea to marry a woman an have kids who you think you will depise and will likely act unpleasant with? If your stomach turns when you see them everyday, they will eventually catch on and how will that affect them? 


I wouldn't be sure that I would be off the hook if I knowingly put myself in the position to treat people like that. We have free will for a reason. And marriage isn't a requirement, also for a reason. 


Like compare the religious benefits of getting married vs the sin of treating your wife and potential kids the way you are describing. You might try you hardest to act pleasant 24/7. But it's likely that you wouldn't be able to keep it up and then your sins will outweigh any benefits you want out of marriage. 


I think it would be way better for you if you stay single and keep managing/limiting your interactions in a way that still allows you to treat people kindly. Don't let other people talk you into a situation that you know is wrong for you."

"True, it's dependant on the organization, but even with lower grades it's been shown that members of certain fraternities still do better than non-fraternity people in lifetime earnings, even though they might do worse on average academically. 

This is theorized, correctly imo, in large part due to the lifelong bonds formed in these organizations. Especially the more powerful groups. 

At the elite school I went to I toured different Greek organizations and they were definitely interested in how much money and power your family came from. They, as strategic organizations, have rational self-interest in doing what is best for themselves and their members, and some are very efficacious.

Being part of a national greek organization of brothers who have in large part previously been vetted for wealth and power has it's advantages. 500,000 greek members in the fraternity I was most involves with. 

Once you conceptualize that, combined with the fact that a bachelor's is great, but the real work doesn't start until Graduate and Ph.D work, then I would say that if you can join and participate in an exclusive greek organization, and your grades suffer somewhat, then depending on your goals, that strategy could be factors more lucrative in the long run than an alternate strategy.

I don't think there's anything quite like hearing yourself coming out of the speakers as a band, where no note is left to chance, it is exactly what you would have played. Something else that is indescribable is seeing the looks on peoples' faces when you are playing live, and you switch instruments, and are as good on one as you are on another, and then another.

It was always my dream to have a band with three or four other people who could do that. Then we could be four or five different bands at will. But as I mentioned, I never met anyone who could play more than one instrument."

"My wife was jealous of my apple watch (42mm) so I bought her one (38mm) for her birthday last year. In the first few days she got an awful round rash in the shape of the sensor on the bottom. She was never allergic to jewelry before so she took it off for a few weeks to heal. She wore it again and it got really blistered and painful after few hours. We called Apple support and they asked us to send pictures (we did) and we agreed to ship the watch back for a replacement. We figured there was a defect (battery leak?) or possibly the metallurgy of the watch was off. We only really expected a refurbished unit to replace a new watch. A week later Apple shipped the same watch back to us. We called the same support rep back and they back-pedaled on their replacement pledge. Pretty much said we were SOL. My wife still has the scar on her arm and plenty of pictures, so we went back and forth on whether it was worth getting a physician to document it and call a lawyer. In the end, we sold the watch to some poor soul on Facebook (at a $ lose) and I gave my 42mm watch to my wife (no negative effects). I was due for a phone upgrade within the year anyway so I got a Galaxy and Gear S3 and once my wife's iPhone gets too old, she'll get one too. I'm not a fanboy to any phone brands, but I hate bad customer service and I vote with my wallet."
"&gt; David Einhorn's interviews give me the impression that he isn't aware of this at all

He's probably biased, his record with scale and momentum driven tech companies isn't exactly great despite him being an incredibly smart guy.  Still you can look at prior forward EPS estimates a year out and see consensus shift towards positive earnings/cashflow in the next year, but there's also always the possibility roadblocks and production problems just keep popping up too.

&gt; Tesla had an order backlog of 100k cars selling at a margin of 20-30%. Why would they not be able to get a loan? I sometimes eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch for dinner and I can get a $800k loan to buy a house. The loanworthiness of Tesla is fine cashflow positive Q3 or no.

Model 3 margins were not nearly that strong until this quarter.  Q2 had them pushing 3% on the Model 3 and even then SG&amp;A + R&amp;D costs were also scaling heavily too which are real cash costs.  On top of that Tesla is pretty heavily leveraged it has almost all of it's real assets securing debt or lines of credit, it's inventory and unsecured debt on top of it all.  I don't think they wouldn't be able to get a loan but it was going to be expensive in terms of rates or maybe even just straight equity.  They had essentially already borrowed against the prospects of them scaling and filling orders already."

The conflict might stay till the next 2 eras

&gt;The third Mistborn series will then be in the modern age with a shattered shard, and a shadow government run by Trell.

Lol Sanderson is aloooot more creative than that. This isn't manga/anime where plots are rehashed like oil reused again.

Trell plans to murder Scadrial anyways not rule Scadrial(if you payed attention to the red eyed people at the end of BoM).

"Unfortunetly, the 3D nature of this game means that there is no way to automate everything based on  file data and get accurate results, ala sfvsim. You could automate recording the data, but that would require...

1. Programatic way to send inputs to the game
2. Programatic way to see game state and track frame advantage
3. Script loops through all of that characters moves, resets positions, doing them on whiff, on hit, on block, on crouch hit, on crouch block, counterhit, etc. *that doesn't account for a ton of stuff that exists in the game, off axis stuff, walls, moves that do something different vs air opponents, etc. (Lots of holes where things can go wrong)* 
4. Get all of this data for all characters, formatted into a form a easily readable table of data, that is understandable to the average player.

Got pretty far on this in Tekken but its a lot of effort for barely any reward and I wouldn't recommend it for your sanity.

Doing it all by hand is probably easier, splitting everything up to character specialists. Everyone can record nowadays, a guide on how to record and count frames and enter data into a spreadsheet could work fine if enough people are motivated."

"I suffer from anxiety and depression and recently learned about spoon theory. I get exhausted easily in social situations (they take a lot of spoons) and recently DHs faaaamily dinners (his mom hosts them) became way too much for me. His mom would ignore me until she felt it was acceptable to acknowledge my existence which was usually right before we were leaving. I firmly told him that spending time with his family in that capacity took too many spoons and it wasn‚Äôt worth it. I no longer go to these faaaamily dinners and he no longer asks me to.

"In short, Infinity War unis are ridiculously good, as well as most Ragnarok ones.

T3 Cap is considered the best but it‚Äôs really personal preference, don‚Äôt let what others say guide you, T3 the characters you enjoy playing as and love. After all, a T3 is a T3.


If you get a T2 selector go with Shuri if you don‚Äôt have her. As for 6 star selectors, I‚Äôd say Iron Hammer (very new character who is maybe the best beginner character nowadays), Hulk (must have Ragnarok uni, useless without it), Sharon Rogers if you don‚Äôt have her."

Or maybe since the GPU is doing the work it makes no difference? I need to have hardware acceleration disabled to make RuneLite actually usable, so would that result in the CPU doing the work instead?

Obviously changing your system resolution is not a good solution if multitasking since everything else gets affected, but in terms of performance and looks, changing my resolution when playing OSRS works very well."

A friend works for them and she's got Reynauds too. They had her as a product tester for all their gear and then they ended up giving her a job because she liked it so much. She is picky as hell about her outdoor gear because her Reynauds is bad. Their stuff is available in the EU and Norway, since it is a Norwegian company. But with the gloves coming to the US, you'd be able to get them. I saw the stuff a few months ago, really nice looking and those viking outdoors types know good cold weather gear.

Like, if you want to see me naked in my room just at least set up a site for it see if there's an audience &amp; hit me up with some of the profits &amp; we can get something rolling.  Obviously just kidding about that last part but based on technology I don't think there are reasonable ways to protect your information or avoid people knowing things about you if they want to so the whole outdated notion of keeping complete privacy is generally absurd to me, so if it's like a ""we don't want a registry because that's an invasion of privacy"" thing, then I'm definitely not opposed to gun registries.

"POTD Record 4-0

Washington Wizards vs. Golden State Warriors (9:30 PM CST)

Unblemished. Undefeated POTD record.  Let‚Äôs keep this steak going!

How many times have we seen gsw come from behind and win the game?  Their biggest deficit is not having a legit starting center to get rebounds and score easily in the paint.  Luckily, today Dwight Howard is out for Washington.  I‚Äôll take the GSW shooters over Washington.  This game will probably be a blow out. Take GSW -10 with confidence. 

Golden State Warriors -10 (-110) 4U

I also like lebron over 2.0 3s prop (-130 on bovada), but I am not adding it as a POTD.  Just a favorable lean that I will be taking.  Spurs shot 53% from three against the lakers on Monday. Clearly, lakers can‚Äôt win on defense.  Look to see lebron shoot at will to make up for personally losing the game on Monday, by bouncing a pass to josh hart, instead of driving to the paint like a king.  2U

Edit:

5-0!!! Lebron went 1-5 from the 3 pt line. Scored one early and then couldn‚Äôt make a sniper shot. Still up. Lets go!!"

"Hi, I am a woman who was in was in a similar position as your wife. My boyfriend at the time (now husband) admitted to me once in a moment to anger that the reason our sex life was hurting was because of my weight gain and him being less attracted to me physically due to it. At the time, it hurt incredibly. He ended up apologizing for how it came out but I told him not to apologize for his feelings. I'm thankful he told me, but it needed to be in a loving way. The pain from him telling me this stung for a while. I started slipping into my old habits from high school of starving myself on days only to binge eat two days worth of calories a day later, which never ended well. Be careful your wife doesnt make any unhealthy decisions after you tell her in case it's her way of responding to your comments. Obviously, I took it very personally and it was tough at first, but what helped me was us deciding to work out together. We came up with a game plan. Even though I didnt lose all the weight I originally gained, my husband would always mention  small positive changes he noticed, such as me feeling lighter on top of him, my ass and stomach being more firm etc. He said that by knowing I was trying to take care of my body and go on this journey, I became more sexually attractive. Plus side is, he began bulking up a bit more and became more attractive to me. It wont be any easy journey for you guys but just keep it a loving, positive experience. Work out together, go grocery shopping at a store that will encourage you to make healthy choices, and have fun planning unique nutritious meals. Make it a group thing. Dont make her feel like it's her problem. Together you guys can overcome this and you will both be much happier in the end :)"

"Thank you for this sweet sentiment.  My husband is older than me, and hasn't aged gracefully (wouldn't be described as handsome by most)- but I am still as attracted to him as the day we met.  I am heavy, but otherwise (according to my doctor) in great health and am pretty for a woman of my weight.  But he has lost all interest in me.  He used to blame it on my weight gain, but I gained the weight due to anti-depressants I started taking AFTER he started rejecting me and it triggered my depression spiraling out of control.  I love him so much, and I am in the process of losing weight, but it will take a while and I know it won't change him in the end.  It breaks my heart that I don't have the intimacy we used to have.  He used to blame me and it was devastating.  After some serious talking and nearly splitting up over it- he has admitted that it is his problem, not mine and has stopped using my weight issue as an excuse.  It still hurts not having that love in my life.  Otherwise, he is incredibly supportive, kind, helpful and a wonderful spouse.   But it will always feel more like having a roommate than a lover..."
All it would take for 90% of fat people to lose weight is just don't eat any snacks and stop drinking soda. I'm convinced of it.

"&gt; Is it some corporate drone seminar they all go to, or is this something they teach in soulless bureaucrat school now?

I suspect a bit of both.  I remember reading something that suggested the proliferation of MBAs in US business (seriously, it seems like every man and his dog has one there...) has resulted in a sort of higher-level hive-mind/group think when it comes to management approaches and the like.  So it's no surprise we see the same tricks over and over, no real innovation.  In a way, it's a bit like a cult religion (which always tend to be dangerous for everyone)."

"&gt; Theists believe in some kind of deity because it's the best possible explanation for existence.

Unfounded.

&gt; Considering our limited knowledge about the past, and given the realty of causality, it's perfectly reasonable to believe that there was something/someone behind our coming into existence.

""I don't know"" does not logically lead to ""so here's my conclusion"".

&gt; An atheist would sit in a room, and since the room is empty, he would claim there is no reason to believe anyone else is around. Mainly an atheist's goal would be to make the room as good as he thinks it should be. He will reject pursuing anyone outside of the room.

First, you're assuming an ""anyone"". Second, what a lovely mischaracterization. Tell me something, was Stephen Hawking content to say ""eh, I'm an atheist, better not try to discover the mysteries of the universe""? Do you think every atheist on this sub is just not curious about it? We're just not accepting something as true without the evidence. Provide some if you've got it.

&gt; Regardless of whether the builder exists or not, I would argue the theist is more rational since it would make sense if the ""goodness"" of the room aligns with the original purpose of the room. The atheist's plan to make it as good as he sees fit, while well-intentioned, is not very reasonable since without understanding the purpose of anything it's easier to destroy it than make it better. 


Goodness and purpose of the room? What are you on about? Why does anything have inherent purpose? You're making that claim, it seems, but can you back it up?

&gt; This is about true theists and atheists, not theists because of their parents or atheists because of what they hear from witty comedians, etc. People who truly believe in a creator and pursuing the creator are more rational than people who reject any type of unknown beings. 

Witty comedians. I like Jimmy Carr as much as the next guy, but he's sure as hell not where I'm getting my information from. 

So let me ask you, and try not to ignore all the questions this time:

What makes you think there's a creator?

Do you have evidence for a creator? If not, why should anyone accept your claim?"

Specifically it appears this man suffers from gynecomastia ‚Äî abnormal breast tissue development in men. It often occurs because being very overweight in men results in their testosterone converting into estrogen and is particularly common when a man is overweight during puberty and throughout the teens. They can lose weight but I‚Äôm pretty certain the breast tissue will need to be surgically removed.

Criticizing people attempting to control Controlling types of speech and how people artistically expressed themselves and controlling peoples reactions to a particular expression is very related to the topics discussed in this subreddit 
"You make good points.

LA Noire was bold and innovative but people even slagged off the facial technology they used for the expression recognition. Which I thought worked pretty well and had great potential. Though the game was a little short on content I wouldn't mind seeing a better fleshed out version. Rumours have been tossed around about a possible LA Noire 2.

Max Payne was a great game and I really did love the stylised way the story unfolded as you played. There was many things about that particular game that made me a fan of Rockstar in the early days.

Sure Rockstar do add innovative gameplay to their games, but they never stick with them in other versions. Example GTA San Andreas where you would get fat eating the wrong food or weight training with a good diet produce the 50 cent look. This sort of great idea wasn't present again until now where eating too much alters your appearance.

With regards micro transactions Rockstar make hell of a lot of money from their physical and digital game sales alone to finance any future games.

The industry has become greedy and people with too much disposable income have become suckers who are willing to spend silly money on the chance to be some god like presence inside a virtual online world. It's madness!"

"On the competitive for honor sub there is evidence that his Dragon Dodge is either nerfed or bugged to around ~300-500ms of iframes instead of the 900ms of iframes it is supposed to have. It also appears that if any attack hits Tiandi's hitbox during his dragon dodge, he will just get hit out of it, making it bad at actually dodging attacks, especially in 4v4 as any stray attack will basically knock him out of it. Bottomline is, his dragon dodge works really inconsistently right now. There have been moments when ive been able to dodge an entire 3 hit chain, and other moments where ill get knocked out of my dragon dodge by a single top light that didnt even connect with my hitbox."

"It sounds like he's just being a jerk, and even if he were a cis guy he'd act this way, and even if he'd never been trans and had wound up still being a woman, they'd probably have a similar reaction of teasing a guy if they found out his dick wasn't as big as their idea of an average dick size. 

So just treat the situation like you would with any guy or with any woman who was literally meanly teasing you or bullying you because of your dick size. I think you should say something to him to try to get him to stop being mean to you about it, especially since it wasn't something that ended after the situation was over, and still continues with him doing things like calling you ""little guy"". Just tell him it hurts your feelings that he makes fun of you, and ask him to stop. You don't have to bring up anything about him being trans, and don't even have to say this next part if he's already being understanding and says he will stop, but to hit the point home you could add something like ""how would you feel if someone you were close to/good friends with/were sleeping with/dating/etc thought you looked funny naked and kept making fun of you for it, even outside of the bedroom?""

If, even after asking him politely to please stop being mean to you about something you literally have no control over, he still won't stop teasing you about it, then honestly he's probably just a jerk in general and you should find nicer friends. "

That's just most of society at this point.  The conservative viewpoint has largely become one of identity politics.  Race, ethnicity, country of origin, gender, sexuality, and religion all play a far bigger role in being a republican than they did 20 years ago.

Hell, I still technically fit the narrowing criteria to be a proper conservative, except I'm excluded due to my profession.  As a scientist, it's really fucking hard to support republicans so long as they keep denying climate change.

You are looking at an extra $75-200/month for a Stinger over a comparable MSRP BMW, Benz, Lexus or Infiniti. 

That said, because there is so much lease cash on the table, to make up for the atrocious MF and poor residual, it is an example of a car where leasing and then immediately buying out the lease will save money over just financing.

"My mom went so far as to buy the ONE thing on my wedding registry I really cared about (kitchenaid pro stand mixer) that was super expensive and I would likely never buy for myself. It was $600.

She bought it so it would show up as sold on the registry and no one else would buy it. Then she kept it, because it couldn't be what I wanted or needed, so she instead bought me a nice Hamilton beech hand mixer, because she'd never used stand mixers and didn't think anyone else should waste money on it. 

So I bought it myself and she's tried to take it a few times in the past (once when we were moving and it almost went missing and another time she was babysitting the kids and it disappeared). Now I make enough money to flat out tell her to never buy me another gift and also to buy a new mixer every month if I wanted, so she's finally accepted that I have chosen to own what I want to own...

"It was not a top-down set,  inspired bye real world but they can break that. The only example is black Sierra Angel that I can see that goes against lore completely. Everything else can be explained in lore if they want.. ravnica can be maliable,  the US army sure has more women then 100 years ago. You probly be just as annoyed if they put in the lore that the simic enhanced a legion of women in ravnica to be soldiars. Or some other thing...The trope of gender roles in fantasy because World history or bioessentialism was begging to be broken. And yes feminism saw this a a traditionally white male hobby. And felt it was there time to try stuff.  I don't agree on them being a parasite on brands already existing. Instead of creating there own brands. Eventually they would get hired in, and for sure they would think of this as political territory or projection.  ""20 years of this and so few gender non binaries, I'm gender nonbinary, wtf.  It be really cool to have a few, I don't connect with traditional roles well""

I will say, ever since gamergate when most of nerd culture became extremely polarized mostly about how they view gender, it's been a shitshow on both sides, ruined communities. I played the game starmade(it's if eve online and Minecraft had a baby) and it literally became moderator wars, and everyone targeting each other based on social views about gender, politics and using derogatory language.   Sargon and the like fed into this culture just as much as sarkisesee.  Both sides are waging a social political war over various IPs and the hotter the war gets, the more people double down. 

You complain about some of the lore,  ok. If rakdos gets petite girls , bans muscular demons, ogres, orcs and we find out bolas is painted with Nazi looking art around him.  It might be getting to much.  A few women I can tolerate in it, it's not 100%, a few oddball stuff like ixalon pirates, jace art. And a few gender fluid, asexual whatever references. Even if it's virtue signalling 90% of the players won't notice. Or find complaint.  And if it's tokenism for marketing. Let those minorities decide if it's insulting for them or welcoming for them.,  it's not my place... If they virtue signal the other way. Like a reference with orzhov  subjugating women and the like to connect it with conservative Christians, or the rakdos seems to lack muscular male figures.  Ok then it's gone to far. I doubt the lore team is dead set on making magic into a proxy for the current social political fighting"

"What does your in-house/on-site professional/supervisor suggest?  I realize internships are sorta designed to foster independent practice/application of work/field related skills/etc, but I'm hoping they didn't just leave you running solo in a school.

&amp;#x200B;

Are you independently deciding to make these calls (as part of your duties), were directed to make these calls (as part of your duties)?  You also mention 'suspected abuse' stuff, which makes me wonder is this a hypothetical? Cause in such cases while you are a mandated reporter, you're usually not supposed to be doing any investigation yourself, so there's no real reason for you to be 'getting to the bottom of stuff' as it were.    You can express your concerns to the state, county, or hybrid (depending on your specific State) framework and they'll send someone out, possibly dovetailed with police investigation, to get more details.

I mean its a balance, if you're suspecting abuse you have basically 2 options: run it up the local tree, inform the school admin of your concerns and allow them to follow their procedures, or bypass them entirely and report your concerns directly to your local state abuse hotline/center and let them make the determination.  I mean sure there's a 3rd option of ""Don't do anything"" but then you're going against your own responsibilities as a social worker/mandated reporter.

&amp;#x200B;

And in those cases usually you're supposed to be kept anonymous as a reporter, so unless you do a ""so I made a report about your child"" comment directly to families, they shouldn't know you were involved...etc etc.

"&gt; When President Trump calls old friends on one of his iPhones to gossip, gripe or solicit their latest take on how he is doing, American intelligence reports indicate that Chinese spies are often listening ‚Äî and putting to use invaluable insights into how to best work the president and affect administration policy, current and former American officials said.

I get a text at 10am while I'm at work (I work on elevators, so usually not in the mindset to be thinking about blinds..) about how unthoughtful I am to not open the blinds for her. I shut it down really fast and we had a minor fight when I got home, but it ended quickly. Still, I was blown away how that was even an issue.

"My current adventure I‚Äôm running I‚Äôm going encumbrance, Rations, water, sickness, weather, etc. it‚Äôs fun. Adds a different level of problem solving. It‚Äôs a overland hex crawl. I put together some code to help me track all that stuff but a spreadsheet would be just as easy. 

Just a note about something I ran into. In case it‚Äôs relevant. Water is a drag. For you maybe not or maybe it will be something else. So whatever I just need to get this off my chest. So we are in a jungle. Technically chult. It rains a lot. Like a lot. With the rain catchers I went with 1 pint collected per hour. They need 2 gallons a day. If they have the rain catcher up all night and during the making and breaking of camp and foraging and during a couple short tests then it collects 2 gallons of clean water each day. They have been traveling on a river. They have purify food and drink. So the only time they would not have water is on a rare non rainy day that they were not near a river. In that case the Druid casts ‚Äúcreate water‚Äù so now I‚Äôm only tracking water for the case that they are away from river, it‚Äôs not raining (rare) and the Druid is out of spell slots. That is a rare edge case that I personally find not worth it. So only because they came prepared I decided to waive tracking the water. I still roll for weather and on a dry day if they are away from a river I‚Äôll track spell slots only that day and remind the players they need water. 

I did that because the game is supposed to be fun and I felt like all that tracking wasn‚Äôt adding to the fun. So my advice is watch out for these situations. If they didn‚Äôt have the necessary spells or equipment I would still track the water as a puzzle to solve but as it stands it‚Äôs already solved

Should check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S7tFrQI2Bw) video on why cops in America don't shoot to wound 99% of the time. TL;DW is chances are a leg shot will kill someone anyway because there are major arteries there and if they have a gun they can still shoot while injured.

&gt; there's more of a focus on deescalation.

There is in America too you just don't see those because they don't make the media any money.

This happens a lot here too, and again you don't hear about it because it doesn't make anyone money

"TheJournal seems to be fairly well known as a website in Ireland and is quite widely visited. I still visit the site for news but only read the comments in it's sister-website, the42.ie.

Instead of having a  comment like you've mentioned with say 125 upvotes and 600 downvotes at the bottom of the comments, they just have the 125 upvotes now and are closer to the top of the comments section. 

As a result, TheJournal comments section has just become a breeding ground for people with populist views who are in a race to the top of the comments section and don't care what they have to type to get there."

The difference between a slow but healthy metabolism and a fast but healthy metabolism is 250-750 calories a day. A deficit easily overcome by changing eating habits. If an otherwise healthy fat person eats less calories than they do normally, while maintaining the same activity levels, they will lose weight 100% of the time. Same with skinny people and increasing calories. People who say they eat more/less with no effect on their weight are lying, or incorrectly tracking their calories."

"My favorite Gish build so far has been the Stone Sorcerer. I've also played a level 2 Paladin / 13 Storm Sorcerer and a level 9 Bladesinger. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far, the Stone Sorcerer has been very easy to build and play. With Twinned, Quickened and the Booming Blade cantrip, they can easily make up for not having the Extra Attack feature. I've always felt like my Stone Sorcerer was an extremely flexible character. Interestingly, most of the spells I've picked for him have been teleportation related. You might think that that limits his flexibility, but I've found his abilities to be an asset. While the build certainly doesn't make a great Tank for a party, it does make for a great support character. He can dish out decent damage when needed, and can also help the players be in the correct position to make the most of the situation. For the most part, this character plays like the Swordmage from Fourth Edition which is a class that I absolutely loved. Now, you could easily build the Stone Sorcerer differently, but he has been really fun for me so far. I've played him as a Greatsword wielding defend your friends type of character. The one oddity about the character, is that he is constantly hoping that his friends will get hit by melee attacks... Apparently, he likes finding vengeance more than he likes protecting people from every possible bit of harm!

&amp;#x200B;

The Paladin / Storm Sorcerer is a pretty close second though.  I've loved the persistent damage that he puts out. In the beginning he mostly played as a Melee Booming Blade character, but now the he has a lot more slots to play with, I've found myself throwing Lightning Bolts and other similar spells considerably more often.

"It's probably a 5 or 6 out of 10, depending on what annoys you, but I've found it playable despite that.  Here are the problems I've run across:

* Game breaking:  When I started up the game the 3rd or 4th time, I got an ""Aska Initialization Failed"" error and it failed to start.  There's a forum discussion thread with workarounds; the ""swap fix"" fixed it for me.

* The mouse isn't integrated.  You can't use it for menus or anything other than (bad) camera movement and the buttons.  Oddly, they natively support button 4 and button 5 mapping.

* If you use a keyboard, you're going to have a bad time until you successfully navigate the options to change the prompts from ""controller"" to ""keyboard"".  They use odd default keys.

* The default subtitles were in English, but the default voice pack was Japanese.  This is fixable in the options.

* Limited resolution options.  You get the main 3 or 4, and that's it.  I don't know what FPS it runs at.  I suspect it's 30, but 30 has never really bothered me much (sacrilege!).

I can't think of anything else.  The gameplay has been pretty smooth, and I haven't had any crashes (yet) in about 25-ish hours.  The only thing in the list above that really annoyed me was the Aska bug, so if you don't get bit by that, and you're used to using a controller, it's probably goes up to about a 7, maybe 8."

"[Yasuhiro Kitao said in a recent Sekiro-related interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAU3xAXPRXY) that he recognizes Sekiro's teaser was released way too early, but they did that to show everyone they were actually working on something. From released strong games in 2014, 2015 and 2016, but 2017 was unusually silent save for The Ringed City, so they chose to wrap the year up with the Sekiro teaser.

Now I'm afraid we're getting something new only by the 2019 E3. Maybe if they release something by 2018 TGA it'll take the Sekiro's spotlight, specially if it's related to the aRPG game. I mean, the internet would explode.

Sadly, about the next Armored Core, I've been only hearing about those vague comments and Japan-exclusive memes... I wonder if somehow the ""strange"" game is related to Armored Core, or if the next AC won't be related at all to the three projects and we'll have to wait until 2020, like you said, to hear something about it."

Neither Jokic nor Embiid nor any other ""traditional"" center does imo. There are physical freaks like AD and KD, but they are few and far between.

So if I had to rank players based on how much they improve my chance to win a championship, Jokic on his current contract would probably barely make the top 15 or even top 20.

" &gt; You could easily have the same arguments about working out, or doing your nails, or eating a certain diet, or being into hair care, etc. - that doing beyond a certain subjective 'acceptable' amount is excessive.



I do have those arguments for all of that.

First two paragraphs: libfem stuff. I come here to get away from that; distinctively not interested in arguments from the POV of individual choice of performing femininity. Femininity as a cluster of behaviors and rituals is an instrument of patriarchy that has a negative effect on all women as a class. When all other women perform femininity, even if I don't, it impacts me in other ways, because we live in an interwoven society.

 &gt; And let's not pretend that we don't have a harder time in life with jobs, and pretty much every facet of our lives, if we didn't put some effort into our appearance. I'd love to dismantle the patriarchy but I can't do that homeless because I got fired for looking unprofessional. Sometimes you have to play the 'game', we might as well enjoy it where we can.

 You won't get fired if you're showered and dressed in clean clothes except for some very exceptional situations, and even then, depending where you live, you can sue the hell out of whoever fired you since it's often legally disallowed to have a differing dress code for men and women. You won't necessarily get praise for the way you look, but it's not gonna make you homeless in most cases either. You want a change in the social norm? Be the change."

"It's hard to know what to recommend without knowing the therapist's current level of competence (doesn't know what transgender means? read several books on the topic?) and the client's specific problems. But, here are some good general resources:

The [APA Practice Guidelines](https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/guidelines.aspx) are a halfway decent starting point. They cover the range of ethically permissible practices. Toward the bottom of the document, in Appendix A, there are links to a range of online resources.

The [IPM website](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/edugraphics-printables/) is pretty good for learning the lingo and has some very nice graphics that could be printed and used as therapeutic worksheets.

[Heterosexual privilege
](https://www.mauracullen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Examples-of-Heterosexual-Privilege.pdf) - A good starting point for a therapist to reflect on what additional challenges a LGB client might be facing.

[Cisgender privilege](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/02/130-examples-cis-privilege/) - Same but for trans.

[Scarleteen](http://www.scarleteen.com/) is a high quality sex ed website that includes extensive information about queer bodies and relationships, including what identities are, how to discern them, coming out, the mechanics of sex, navigating a system that's not designed for you, etc. It's a great resource for both clinicians and clients.

[SAMSHA](https://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content/PEP14-LGBTKIDS/PEP14-LGBTKIDS.pdf) has a guide for convincing families to be more supportive. No idea how good it is.

[This article](https://journals.cdrs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2012/10/2010_vol1_pg8_horner.pdf) is about how to approach a client who has been through so-called ""conversion therapy"".

And lastly, [this](https://nccc.georgetown.edu/documents/Final%20LGBTQ%20Checklist.pdf) is a checklist for the clinician to assess themselves as to how well they're supporting LGBTQ+ clients. It's focused on therapists who specialize in youth, but it could be easily adapted for older ages as well.

If you need something more specific (e.g., custody evaluations, adapting panic attack protocols to a trans client, etc.) let me know what you're after and I'll try to dig something up for you."

The non-camping player has to actively pressure the camping player in order to use his positional advantage to stop the camping player from coming back, which ironically also empowers walkoff camping. Whether or not it‚Äôs optimal to pressure is going to be very match-up dependent, but in general, temporary walkoff stages are going to further benefit mobile characters.

They may be able to prevent Spacey specifically from abusing a position of power by stripping such position away, but it won't affect others being abusers or not. You think rapists are gonna see that Spacey was fired and go ""aw shucks, guess I better not rape, huh"", don't you. You're the kind of people who thinks the solution to rapists is ""teaching people not to rape"", aren't you.

And second of all, Spacey didn't have a ""platform"", do you even know what that word means? He's an actor, not a politician or an activist of any kind. And even if you were to consider his job a platform, you're speaking as if he had been advocating for sexual assault and pedophilia or something like that, and firing him somehow... Prevents him from doing that? I don't know how you got to this but your entire line of thinking here is twisted.

&gt;And if you really think that the only reason why he got fired is because the show cares about it's rating, then you are quite a sad individual with a very wrong and one sided view of the world.

No, that's literally how it is. You really think that Hollywood wasn't aware from day 1 of Spacey's wrongdoings? You think the Harvey Weinstein shit was a secret? These people don't care about anything but their own egos and pockets. They only ostracize rapists when the public finds out they're rapists, because it's bad marketing to affiliate with a rapist. That's literally all there is to it. Hollywood continues and will continue to support rapists and pedophiles as long as their cases don't become public.

&gt;It is showbusiness, true, what an intellectual statement you got there, but there are also humans involved in it.

Yeah, Hollywood is known for its humanity.

&gt;And they have feelings, and they fired him because they were sick of the stories that got published.

Of which they, of course, found out in 2017, despite the entirety of Hollywood already knowing about his abusive tendencies for decades. It's always the same with this people.

&gt;Moral was a huge factor in the decision, the world isn't just about money you sad little individual.

"* It'd be weird to include Link, since, well, silent protagonist and all.
* It'd be weird to include the Zelda series without Link too.
* Xenoblade is sci-fi high fantasy, it's okay for Smash, but not so much in a world of Metals and Magics.

Kid Icarus is okay, but to the layperson, the only three iconic Kid Icarus characters are Pit, Dark Pit and Palutena, (so, again, the Smash Bros effect.)

I mean, depending on which source you use, Uprising only sold somewhere between 1.2 to 1.3 million copies, so going beyond those three icons isn't a good idea.

I mean, other than that, the only other character in Smash that feels appropriate to the high fantasy setting is Cloud, and Square's been buddy-buddy recently with Nintendo.

...personally, I don't have any high hopes for crossovers, but if it happens, it'd be nice if it felt cohesive."

"I pray to Aphrodite! She's pretty alright, although a bit fickle? I feel like she listens, but doesn't necessarily do things to help me out, or at the very least if she does help it's in a very unexpected way. She's more helped people on my behalf (including an ace friend that Aphrodite wasn't too keen on because, well, asexual) than helped me, if that makes sense? But she's good to me and I'm good to her, and it's all pretty nice.

I think she's got a lot to her, and isn't as straightforward as one would tend to expect? She's more than *just* love or beauty. In my experience, she likes when I acknowledge that in addition to being a love goddess, she sprang from the sea. It's an important aspect to her that I sometimes feel like people forget."

"Lack of subtlety and occasional vicious misogyny.

Showing the domestic abuse Michael suffered as a child, the bullying he faced from his peers and his masculine insecurity are all well and good, but when that's all we're offered in terms of characterization, that can grow stale. Every single line or moment in Michael's childhood seems to only exist as explanation for his evil destiny. None of the trauma he endures really hits because it's all so repetitive. Even the friendship of Loomis and Michael, while well handled, lacks the subtlety of their relationship in the sequels. Just the scene in Halloween 5 where Loomis confronts Michael in the Myers House about how they can stop his eternal rage together has more nuance, subtlety, pathos and depth than anything featured in this film.

To add to that, I'm not sure why Rob Zombie was so concerned with justifying nearly 80% of Michael's kills. Most of Michael's victims are outright horrible people, which almost frames Michael in the role of an antihero. When he breaks that role and goes after somebody innocent or someone who had been good to him (Danny Trejo's asylum janitor, for example) it almost feels out of character and obligatory. Michael hardly feels like the embodiment of evil when evil is everywhere you turn.

With Rob Zombie adapting a Halloween film, you really have to take the good with the bad. On the good side, we do get to explore the mind of one of the most infamous killers in cinematic history; an intriguing prospect. On the bad, we also get an obnoxious abundance of juvenile cursing, (intentionally) grimy cinematography and constant, gratutious sexual violence against women. Granted Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers featured an instance of sexual violence as well, but it was only a single instance that I would argue made sense for the characters, themes and tone of the film. Rob Zombie's Halloween features constant scenes of rape or allusions to rape that merely feel thrown in just for the sake of shock value. With just how grindhouse and exploitative this film is, one almost gets the feeling that Rob Zombie would have been better off remaking The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, not Halloween.

That said, I don't think it's a horrible film. The acting all around is great (Even though this movie's version of Loomis is, admittedly, insulting as Hell to the original), I like Michael's relationship with Loomis at Smith's Grove (Though Halloween 5 handled their weird little friendship in a far more subtle and mature way in the Myers House scene) and I don't even mind the bare bones concept of humanizing Michael (Though it's executed wrong.) I just don't think that it's the great film its defenders will hail it as...That would be Halloween 6, ;)"

&gt;He was a GOOD guy. A good artist. And if someone really really respects that flag then they ought to respect freedom as well.

&gt;How about it? Stop banning people for our opinion. Our opinion is all this country has to prevent violence.

&gt;We can't talk over some invisible wall.

&gt;I won't rest until the wall that has been erected to try to destroy America is removed. Whether this sub does it or reddit does it.

&gt;Reddit can't stand between America and America.

&gt;It's wrong. The ban is wrong. I don't need to ""win"" any argument but we need to talk.

&gt;This ban is morally wrong. It's a violation of Reddit's intent of the use of moderation. And it doesn't help you or me or this country to try to put a ""berlin wall"" in the way of free public discussion.

**Your worst TAC moments**:¬†not getting Roxanne. 1000000%. Not even not getting Laharl has made me this salty. Oh yeah, not getting Laharl also.

**Your best unit**: Noctis by far. He's on every team. Even against full thunder. Much OP for now.

**Your other notable units**:¬†do farmable units count? If yes, then them.

**Your disappointing units**:¬†~~every unit I haven't managed to raise because the equipment is not there. Or  the plethora of others I haven't JM because of JE and don't want to waste that equipment~~ Magnus is straight garbage, and so is Elizabeth

**One unit that evades you**:¬†any unit that's Dark, Fire or GL exclusive. Especially you Aswald.

"Ive always been an outdoorsy person. My family bought a old tree farm before i was born and we‚Äôve added on over the next several years. Even now we purchase more land. We roughly have 300-ish acres.  We‚Äôve always camped, fish, hunt and so forth. 

Even when i was little i would grab a flashlight, my sleeping bag and my pocket knife and tell my parents ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off to sleep in the woods‚Äù.  And they didn‚Äôt mind. They knew i was a responsible kid.  The rule was i could only go if i was close enough to see the bonfire, in case of emergency i could be in shouting distance. 

I would get a large stick and prop it on a tree and make a very very rough lean to shelter. Id cover it in pine branches and needles. Then set up my sleeping bag. And just lay down. Sometimes id nap. Most of the time id just look at the stars between the branches. I only really had a full nights rest a couple times. But that was my start. 


Then in high school we had a after school class called ‚Äúadventure course‚Äù. We did all kinds of awesome stuff. Rock climbing, making a Inuit whaling canoe. But the best thing we did was a 24 hour hike. We went down to southern ohio to a place where we could do it. It was tough. I had my dads super old boy scout pack. I didn‚Äôt come prepared at all.  I had a old throw blanket, canteen of water, pocket knife (a cheap one at that), a bag of bagels and a small jar of peanut butter.  But that experience made me want more. And since then I was obsessed with doing more. 

And there you go. "

"&gt;Not really. There is no reason to expect to see uniform demographics in all things.

Sure not uniform, but the odds of getting the results we did (assuming all things are equal) is so astronomically low, it is fair to raise the point and maaaaybe consider that not all things are equal.

&gt;The NBA being disproportionately black, for instance, doesn't imply we should panic or worry that the teams won't perform adequately unless they make a concerted effort to recruit more white people.

But in this case it is tied to race (greater extreme variance in height).

"You probably wont see this answer OP.  But I wanted to comment in case someone might.  The bottom line you'll find in all these answers is that science in and of itself by its nature can only observe what is.  It cannot observe what is not.  It can hypothesize and predict but not prove.  Faith by its nature is intangible.  You cannot measure it or put it in a box.  It is a choice based on revelation...in the Christian's case coming from the bible.  You will never be able to prove faith.  Or prove that God is real.  If you could put God in a box and measure him, he would not be God.  

I highly encourage you to read the book ""Mere Christianity"" by CS Lewis.  It does a great job exploring the question you asked.  Theres a pdf version online if you google it!"

There are a lot less of them to kill than they want to kill. 6 percent is a lot of people. But think of the groups they want to kill and how much we outnumber them. They want to kill children just like their boss AH did.

"I can see another side of this discussion... 

If a child dies before they can be held morally accountable by God, and they automatically go to heaven because of that, then wouldn't it be more ethical to kill all children before they can sin? To guarantee their place in heaven? 

Obviously killing children should probably be seen as a bad thing, but if one takes this ""eternal perspective"", then it would be more like doing their ""souls"" a favor. Maybe the one doing the killing would have to go to hell as a result, but wouldn't those baby souls be grateful for the free pass into heaven? (Just kill them right after baptism if you believe in original sin.)

"I have an S7 Edge and the last couple of updates have completely killed my mobile experience. I've already swapped out the OEM battery as it started bloating about a year ago. Plugging in the device starts it chugging. Opening a conversation in the stock messenger app takes almost 30 seconds compared to the 1-2 seconds prior to the updates. When I try to open the keyboard (SwiftKey), it'll lag behind by several words when it never used to do that. \*I\* don't have ""garbage"" like Insta or Snap, but the insane amount of bloatware that keeps getting piled on with every update and I can't delete doesn't help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one saying that when I have something that works, I shouldn't even have to tell the device twice that I don't want to change it. If an update is in the pipelines, tell me ""hey, there's an update. Want it?"" and if I click ""no"", it should just fucking take that choice.

I invited her to attend a music festival earlier this summer and she went around asking my friends if I had any interest in her romantically and how she could get me to like her. I cut off communication after confronting her and a few months go by. I start seeing this new girl who is now my girlfriend. One night, while we are on the couch, she shows me her phone and a list of viewers of her Instagram story. She asks, ""who is this?"" Sure enough, there is the girls image and her username."

"Will probably get made fun of for this but I‚Äôll share my perspective. Anyone is welcome to disagree and I won‚Äôt try to force my beliefs on anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to hear.

I‚Äôm a Christian and I see God work small miracles in my life all the time. Yesterday, I was talking with my Grandpa on our farm. He told me about a friend of his (we‚Äôll call her Sarah, I don‚Äôt remember her name) who dove into a shallow pool when she was a kid and broke her neck and went unconscious. She was floating in the pool face down unable to speak or move. Her sister was laying out asleep in a beach chair facing away from her and a crab bit or clawed or something her sister in the foot. This woke her up in time to see her sister drowning in the pool. Shes now recovered and is an adult who runs a huge missionary organization. 

Some may say this is a coincidence but a crab biting her sister in the foot to wake her up to see her sister drowning and be able to save her in time is something that doesn‚Äôt seem like a coincidence to me. I see God working in my life in many ways. I‚Äôve been through some bad stuff in my life and wouldn‚Äôt be here without my faith. When I lost all my friends and was alone, I was comforted by what I believe to be my God.

"If you don't know the IPA, learn it. It is absolutely necessary to making a decent language.

Read as much as you can about different languages (descriptive linguistics), and use any foreign languages you may know to avoid ciphering (making a one-to-one word-for-word translation instead of a new grammar and vocabulary.)

Especially read up on the languages you want to base your conlang off of: Romance languages if you're doing a romlang; Semitic languages such as Amharic, Arabic, and Hebrew if you're doing a Semitic-inspired conlang; and so on. Remember, you can mix different elements from different linguistic areas pretty freely for the most part, though some combinations are can be in conflict or unnaturalistic, for example having a conlang that is zero-marking and has an Austronesian alignment.

Another thing I would recommend would be to give your conlang's vocabulary detailed definitions in English; avoid simple, one- or two-word glosses. Likewise, look for good, clear dictionaries for your source languages if you're doing a lot a posteiriori work, taking loans, or even just looking for inspiration for un-Englishy semantics.

Happy conlanging and look forward to seeing your work soon!"

"I don't imagine most of the unnamed cases generate a strong suspect but random people can jailed by that method via bad policing.  Here's a particularly awful one I saved recently:    

by chocolate_spaghetti 

That happened to my cousin.  A girl actually had been raped and reported it. The police had rounded up a bunch of people that were in the area that fit her extremely vague description. She couldn‚Äôt remember anything about the attacker except that he was young and black. 

My cousin was 12 years old and playing outside when the police picked him up and took him back to the station for questioning before even notifying his mother. They then coached the woman into saying she was sure it was him. He spent 5 years locked up, was released at 17.  

While he was locked up he was also molested by a guard. After he had served his full sentence, the woman came forward and said she was sure it wasn‚Äôt my cousin and that she had been coached.  

It‚Äôs been nearly 20 years since that happened and my cousin still has issues trusting anyone and has and extreme hatred of authority. He has PTSD from the sexual assault and he doesn‚Äôt trust anyone. If anything bad ever happens to him, he blames those closest to him and assumes everyone is working against him. He‚Äôs pushed nearly everyone in our family away from him. I try to be there for the guy but he‚Äôs a difficult person to be around. 

This type of stuff has a very long lasting effect on people, it‚Äôs more than just admitting you‚Äôre wrong and it being over if you do this to someone."

"Ok so let's do the math.

Assuming there's 25 people working at your office that means they have a 1/10,000,000 chance of winning the jackpot, so statistically they'd have to play the lottery once a week for  200,000 years to win and when you won you'd receive about $15,000,000 in splits after taxes if the jackpot was 1.5 billion and you took the lump sum. 

If you'd just set aside money each week instead, you'd have $20,000,000 not counting revenue from investments which would make this total way bigger. 

Don't play the lottery no matter how little money you have. It's nrver worth it."

This is mathematically unsound. If you stay 4k in debt with 3k in savings and a 3k emergency comes up, your net worth goes to -4k. If you pay off 3k of the debt and a 3k emergency comes up, your net worth goes to -4k. The only difference is paying extra interest for no reason, should an emergency not arise or in the interim."

"Error. De hecho s√≠ hay quienes sostienen que el lenguaje es un mecanismo para crear nuestras ideas y por medio de ellas comprender el mundo. Por esto sostienen que un cambio en el lenguaje permitir√≠a cambiar la manera en c√≥mo ideamos y c√≥mo comprendemos las cosas a tal grado de mejorar la sociedad.

El hecho de que niegues que existan personas sosteniendo argumentos as√≠ s√≥lo permite dos posibilidades:

1. Sabes que existen personas utilizando esto como argumento (no quiere decir que todas, ni siquiera la mayor√≠a. Tampoco quiere decir que no sostengan otros argumentos de complemento, como la representatividad), pero deliberadamente lo ignoras y lo niegas para darle m√°s peso argumentativo a tu cr√≠tica. Lo que ser√≠a lamentable.
2. Est√°s tan poco informado sobre el tema que no te has topado con las personas y los textos que defienden ideas as√≠, lo que demuestra tu ignorancia sobre el tema. Lo que tambi√©n ser√≠a lamentable.

Esto no quiere decir que el argumento ""utilitarista"" que cuestionas no peque un poco de simplista. 

&amp;#x200B;

Por otro lado, tus observaciones sobre los errores conceptuales son err√≥neas. De hecho, t√∫ eres el que comete los errores conceptuales.

1. Bajo los criterios de la imagen que t√∫ cuestionas, no se est√° usando al g√©nero gramatical como equivalente de lenguaje inclusivo. De hecho se usa como una forma contraria. Es decir, se asume que los lenguajes donde se utilizan g√©neros para discernir entre cosas y personas tienden a no ser ""inclusivos"" por definici√≥n. En cambio, los lenguajes donde no existen formas gramaticales de g√©nero no pueden ser ""exclusivos"", puesto que no tienen formas que, en principio, les permitan serlo. Por lo tanto, t√∫ ejemplo para demeritar su aproximaci√≥n conceptual es, de hecho, un argumento que le sirve para darle m√°s fuerza. 
2. Quiz√° debiste dejar de asumir e investigar un poco. El √≠nidice de brecha de g√©nero que se utiliza en la imagen no s√≥lo se basa en brecha econ√≥mica. De hecho utiliza un criterio de cuatro √°reas de an√°lisis que se utilizan conjuntamente para generar un valor. 

Aqu√≠ lo que veo es una hipocres√≠a e iron√≠a intelectual.

"The Lions had 35 sacks in 16 games last season, and already have 21 sacks this year with 10 games to go.

In Matt Patricia's system, the defensive line's job is to set the edge while occupying space and offensive linemen so the linebackers can do their thing.  

The defensive line had a terrible outing against the Jets, but has gotten better managing their responsibilities as a unit each and every game.  

Against Miami, they played their most complete game.  Other then giving up the 54 yard run by Kenyan Drake, they did their job for the most part."

When I saw that the first thing they did with Forsaken was kill Cayde 6 off for real, I knew they were starting to go in the right direction.

I can only hope that the rest of the lovable sit-com crew of characters die next in some sort of pointless space craft crash that quickly wraps things up.

Just think about it for a moment.... Imagine how much more though provoking and awe inspiring this game would be if things were left up to your imagination, instead of being blurted out to you by cartoon character personalities that waste your time with their pointless bullshit."

"Because trans actors exist, and trans people would benefit more from a trans person to identify with/look up to, in basic terms. Trans stories for trans people can still be told, so this idea that this movie couldn't be told without Scar Jo is dumb in the first place, because that movie *shouldn't* be made unless you can get a trans actor for it. They are out there and they want work just like any actor, and some of them are incredibly talented and perfect for whatever role comes their way.

Edit: to be clear, I'm not talking about actors that I know of. It's an unfortunate reality that trans actors are deeply underrepresented in Hollywood and, well, everywhere. They're just recently being accepted by society as a valid thing, let alone put in major roles. But if you think that trans people don't/can't have the same level of talent as anybody else, then you should really take time to examine your own bigotry. We should get trans actors known, and let them have their own spotlight for their own stories. "

"The country is not going to go anywhere if foreign influence comes in. This is something that Iranians need to take care of by themselves, any external actors will screw it up like 1906 and 1953. Iranians THEMSELVES have to learn to separate church from state, organically. What are we, children? Why do we need another country running all our shit? The best thing is for Iranians themselves to change the system. I personally do believe it's possible, if it weren't for the west continually fucking things up. 

Let me ask you this: do you honestly believe the hardliners would have such a strong foothold if it weren't for constant threats and aggression from the west? Do you think Iran's economy would be such a mess if there were no sanctions? Do you think civil rights protests would be viewed with such paranoia if the US didn't immediately jump to ""supporting"" them, thereby tainting the movement with the perception of being foreign? The hardliners are a natural populist reaction to a great external threat, they wouldn't be here if the nobody stuck their dick in Iranian affairs in the first place. 

Every time reformists and moderates come into power, promise reconciliation with the west, make sincere efforts, only to have the United States take a big steaming pile of shit on it. Both Khatami and Rouhani have been royally screwed, and what does it lead to? More sanctions, more broken deals, and hardliner scumbags saying ""I told you so"". The right wing in the US/Israel and Iran feed off of each other's hatred. They help each other, perhaps unintentionally, to stay in power and have a ""bogieman"" to blame everything on. If you actually believe foreign intervention is good for Iran, I have no words for you. "

"So let me see if I have this straight. The Democratic Party mailed multiple live explosive devices to high profile Americans. They did so knowing they would be found before they reached their targets, who by the way are former Democrats, Trump critics (whom he has many), and a major Democratic donor. 

This was done to make republicans look bad before an election. The devices were designed in a way that they could have detonated from stress factors (falls, heat, etc.) and we know this via law enforcement officials. Any one of them being improperly handled or reaching its destination would have resulted in loss of life. 

The FBI would be able to easily track the source of these packages from a major Political Party, and the DoJ is run by Republicans (along with the rest of the entire government) who would gleefully jump on an opportunity to expose the Democrats for a move so nefarious. 

Best case scenario, nobody is hurt and... idk... people are pissed? Kinda like they have been for years now? 

Weigh that risk/reward for a second and get back to me. 

Now to Scenario B: a mentally deranged individual hears the rhetoric of the President of the United States, and his endorsements of conspiracy theorists and right wing extremist groups, and the hateful rhetoric that they produce, and targets people who are specifically political opponents of the President and whom the President promotes violence against and vilifies.

"While I agree that Take 10/20 are wonderful time and effort savers you should look at the time requirements again.

Using ""take 10"" only takes as much time as using the skill normally would take.  Picking a simple lock would normally be a full round DC 15 Mechanics (SECR pg 69) so using take 10 would just take a round instead of that SIX ROUNDS you are suggesting.  Now there is a penalty for failure on that application of Mechanics so they CAN NOT use ""take 20"" (you can only do that if there is no penalty for failure) but if they could then it would take the character 20 rounds or a bit over 6 minutes.

Now one thing I will often do when I have a skill that I can use ""take 10"" on and may also reroll if I failed (which usually means ""take 20"" wasn't an option) I'll usually say I'm taking twice the usual time so I could roll one attempt and use ""take 10"" on the other.  This way I always make sure I get at least a decent result even if I don't know what the rolled number was.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking this same thing. There is such an element of deep control. People get placed into these leadership roles in churches, and feel the need to control people. If it's not leadership, it's the parents controlling their children and demanding their own version of perfection, for the sake of the reputation of the parents. 

On another note, I truly don't understand the obsession with sexual impurity. Church people surely know how to make it seem like it is the worst 'sin' you could ever commit. Purity culture does way more harm than good. How about focusing on being humble? What about the person who is without sin casting the first stone?"

"Teofimo Lopez, Shakur Stevenson - super obvious. It's just a 100% fact they both will become superstars. Who else? Daniyar Yeleusinov is one of the hottest prospects in boxing atm. 100% sure he's going to be a World Champ soon. Mohammed Rabii. 100% future champion. 

I legit would bet everything I have on these guys, it's so obvious. Not sure about other ppl, but these four are SUPER obvious. There is no way they won't become world champs, only if they get injured and quit boxing like Pirog did."

Late Okada was truly best boy.
"When I met my wife she had 2 old cats and I had 2 older cats. After a few years mine passed on and I missed having my own cats. So I went and adopted one who turned out to be a maniac that tormented her cats. Shortly afterwards we started fostering. My boy liked all the kittens but he and one of them fell absolutely in love. They were inseparable. So I adopted her to keep him company. It was a good arrangement because she kept him from chasing the old cats around.    
Here they are together. This was the picture that convinced me to keep her.

Some (maybe most) online programs have online courses and also require that you get lab experience. You would have to find a lab close to you that would be willing to proctor your experience. Look at Weber State--there are a lot of people nation wide that do that program. I did my online courses through Idaho State University and did my lab experience at the hospital I was working at that was not really affiliated with the program--just willing to proctor me.
This seemed to fix it! Thank you. I just had to do it a few times.
"The Hamming distance between two 16-bit inputs can range from 0 to 16, so you would only need a 5-bit output. You are correct to first XOR the two inputs; then you would need to count the number of 1's. For a small number of input bits this can be done with pure combinational logic. However for 16-bit inputs it would be better to include some flip-flops and a simple state machine to compare each bit index and increment a counter if it is 1."

"I‚Äôm a little late but fortuitously I just finished Franny and Zooey for the nth time.

First and foremost, I love Franny Glass but I absolutely adore Zooey. I think her section is better but I just love his character so much more that I couldn‚Äôt possibly avoid his section. I also have an unhealthy obsession with Seymour and Buddy‚Äôs views on religious philosophy and thought, deeply fueled by Zooey‚Äôs section.

Second, that bathroom scene with his mother is probably my favorite scene in all of literature. There‚Äôs something so real about that moment and all of its exasperation and familial squabbling.

Overall, I think Franny sets up the whole ‚Äúpeople  an be phony and self obsessed‚Äù bit, especially given how annoying Lane is and then Zooey just knocks the whole thing over and calls her out on it. I feel like that counterpoint is necessary and it acts as a nice response too on the idea of people as phonies from Catcher in the Rye."

"I don't hate the idea of Harper on the Cubs. I think yes, it's entirely possible he's the last piece they need to become the 1950s Yankees and to cement them as a legacy for generations.

I think it's just as possible, though, that he becomes this generation's Vernon Jordan or even Albert Pujols Angels contract.

And he's just an awful human being. He could be the Barry Bonds presence in the Cubs clubhouse, without all that performance.

I think I'd be willing to risk the first thing to get the second. 

I'm hoping to see him in a Cubs jersey next summer."

"The lead author also has significant conflicts of interest that aren't reported. He has built a business and written multiple books based on this trademarked therapeutic strategy named after himself. 

These conflicts wouldn't alone suggest the research is rubbish but in combination the shoddy research design and failure to disclose conflicts makes this research worse than worthless. His protocol is about formulating personalised interventions targeting multiple therapeutic parameters., each patient would have received a different treatment composed of multiple interventions with no blinding or controls and an outrageous amount of experimenter bias.

There isn't even a methodology so it's impossible to replicate."

"I would say it is a combination of an innate desire to have an explanation for things we will likely never explain, and indoctrination by previous generations. 

It is not a coincidence that a vast majority of religious people have the same religion as their parents. They are not given the opportunity to think for themselves, from the moment they are born, religion makes up a huge portion of their lives. They are not taught to desire evidence, they just accept everything their parents say as absolute fact (evolutionarily there is evidence to show our reliance on the advice of our parents growing up). So when they develop enough to actually think for themselves, it is extremely difficult to overcome this deep rooted idea that there MUST be a god. It is a very easy thing to comprehend as a child, the idea that there‚Äôs just some super magical bloke who snapped his fingers and made everything, it just makes sense to a kid. No kid will ever be able to comprehend the Big Bang and universe expansion, and the very slow upbringing of life on earth and evolution into humans. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much evidence you give to show how completely wrong everything in the bible is, or how much logical deduction you throw at them which makes the very idea of a God nothing short of ludicrous, you are battling against against something deeply woven into their subconscious. It would be very like trying to get somebody to forget their native language. "

I'm sure my experiences have direct contrary experiences by other people, but in my experience with pixel phones, they seem to have much worse quality and quality control.

Audio recording quality on every pixel I've had has been really poor. I never got a 2 xl that didn't have ridiculous speaker rattle. My 3 xl is exhibiting both the app killing and photos not saving (luckily I have no screen issues).

I've heard that from a lot of people on Reddit. Do you know about how complex taxes are in the USA? I live in one county and there are different sales taxes based on the city. Neighboring cities have different sales tax. Sales tax also depends on what the item is too. Fast food restaurants have the highest sales tax where I live. Some states have no sales tax but their property tax is insanely high compared to other states. It wouldn't be possible for Wendy's to have one advertisement for a $0.99 cheeseburger - they'd have to make many different ads for many different locations.

"Your injuries will slow down as you improve and learn how to be safe. That's one of the tragic truths of BJJ -- newbs are least aware of what's dangerous and what's not. Add the spaz factor for white belts, and it's even worse. 

I turn 38 in January, so I get where you're coming from. I bruised a rib a few weeks ago, and I still have a couple more weeks to go. When stuff happens, take your break, and come back when you're better. Something sidelines me maybe once a year, but it was more in that first year for sure. 

And slow down, flow roll, tap early and often. Roll like you're 80 so you can roll till you're 80.

Btw, best thing I did to reduce injury rate was to pick one or two rolls a week to go hard, and force myself to ease up the rest of the time. Gotta learn not to ramp up to the young guys' speed, and budget your expenditures."

If you play some midrange deck with green, carnage tyrant is a beast. But be careful if they play white since settle and cleansing nova can kill him.
Nullhide ferox and vine mare are good options too, but not as good as tyrant.
If you play a midrange deck without green... Well, you are fucked in this standard rotation. Control usually wins against midrange decks since they aren't enaugh aggressive to keep the presi√≥n and control wins the long game.

Also, try to play around cards that win you, like board sweepers or teferi, for example. Try not to fill the board with a bunch of creatures, and don't attack with all of them if you think they have settle. Think that you can force the cleansing nova, so they tapped out and then you play a great thread, like vraskas, Vivien reid, experimental frienzy, whatever. "

obviously keep rares. even rares you usually wouldnt keep, just in case you find yourself missing a res when you change some items around youre glad if you have that one ring that gives you 30 fire res. also if you rip it helps you get started on a new character again.

dont be lazy to mule. when you find a good item stash that shit on a mule. you dont want to be that guy that finds a windforce finishes the mf run and dies with it in stash just for example.

use socket quests to socket decent leveling uniques with runes for res. res is king. especially lightning and fire you want as much as you can.

use imbue quests from charsi for gloves boots or helmet and hope for some res

cannot be frozen is so much more important in hardcore, maxblock is so much move valuble, faster hit recovery breakpoints are something youll have to think about when changeing gear or even planning gear. youll wanna study the fhr and fbr breakpoints for your class so you know what to expect.

block is something very easy to obtain for a lot of classes early on (assa pala have amazing block frames even with 0 faster block) so just throw an eld into some unique or rare shield with socket quest. block takes more dex the higher level you get so the lower you are means even little investment into dex can end you up on a 50%ish blockchance.

and last but not least treat your merc well. even in normal throw some gear his way and pot him up especially for bosses its worth it.
if youre scared of duriel just throw some rares your mercs way and spam some pots on him hell tank him pretty well. you can even tp out a few times to resurrect him should he not be able.

i hope i helped you out with some of it."

"I think it would be pretty useful, consider the size of many rooms in your home, how many are that wide? Also they could drill 2 tunnels side by side so there is a small overlap and then thy just have to dig out the small amount of dirt/rock where the 2 tunnels join. It is not like this is about creating the height of luxury in the early stages. Also tunnels can be very long, allowing ample space overall and they can loop and join up etc to create a maze of living space. I suspect that the largest spaces will be communal living spaces, like an underground park where people can go to get a sense of space and meetup with others. Think of it as a bit like an underground ants nest."

"It would be possible for us to create a paradox with knowledge of the future. For example, if I created a machine with a camera that sees ten seconds into the future. It is pointed at a lightbulb, if the camera detects light from the bulb, it turns the light off. If it detects no light, it turns it on. What happens? If the light was off to start, ten seconds in the future it would be off, so the machine turns it on, but now in the future it will on so it turns off, etc. etc. 

It is possible to see the future and interact with the past without causing these paradoxes, but it would require a level of care and planning we would be unlikely to achieve. Furthermore, if we make decisions about someone's future choice and prevent it, then did that person actually have free will to choose something that doesn't happen? If it doesn't actually happen, how did we know to prevent it"

"We had bought some snails for our fiahtank and ended up with a breeder snail who hitched a ride. These things are apparently used by snail sellers to produce tons and tons of snails. Within 2 weeks our tank was overrun by the little buggers. They covered the tank glass and decor. I estimated at least 200 within a month. They say without replacing/boiling everything in and including the tank, you can never get rid of them. They even live in the bottom gravel.
  
60 gallon tank with a bunch of tetras, couple of corys, 1 big suckerfish, and some random other fish. The whole ecosystem was balanced untill this happened. They were eating the algae supply for the suckerfish and leftover food for the corys.

Spoke to some local fish suppliers and they suggested getting LOACHES. They loooove eating snails. We got 2. Ever throw treats all over the living room floor for your dogs? This is what it would look like. The loaches had the population down to maybe 15 within 2 weeks and have been maintaining them since.

"To be fair, you have to have a very high football IQ to understand Brozovic‚Äôs action. The tactical defending is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical defending most of the tackles will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Brozovic's defensive outlook, which is deftly woven into his style of play- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Pirlo‚Äôs tactical approach, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these tactics, to realize that they're not just master defending- they say something deep about FOOTBALL. As a consequence, people who dislike defending truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Brozovic's existential response ""I do not know why I got it, I just chose when I got my hair last cut"" when discussing his latest blond hair-do, which itself is a cryptic reference to Messi's Russian epic blonde change of look. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Spalletis‚Äô genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools, how I pity them.

"If its soreness, I make an effort to still get to the gym and do something. I extend my time warming-up longer and make sure to do something that gets me pretty sweaty. Then I‚Äôll try to address any areas that are particularly sore. For example, if my quads are really sore, I will do some banded hip mobility and the couch stretch. Then I will modify the workout that day if there is some movement redundancy that would really crush me.


When I was training full-time and I tweaked something, I would put my full attention in to managing it. I would schedule an appointment with Airrosti, do mobility and pre-hab exercises for the area, change my programming for that day, week or longer, however long it took to get it back to 100% and depending on what was tweaked use other recovery tools and providers such as Marc pro/compex (I‚Äôve used both), normatec leg sleeves, cryotherapy, acupuncture, massage, chiropractic. Its so in-grained in me now that mentality of ‚Äúthis small issue must be addressed before it becomes a big issue‚Äù‚Ä¶so even with a busier schedule, I try to find a way to get an appointment and in the meantime try to keep moving in a therapeutic way rather than a pushing through pain way.

The two biggest times that I‚Äôve had to step back from training since I started CrossFit have been when I tore my bicep tendon in Fall 2015 and this year during the last month of my pregnancy and this postpartum time‚Ä¶especially the first 6-8 weeks. I‚Äôve realized that for me, when the pressure of training for competition is not there, all I really need to feel like myself and less antsy about not being able to workout like I want to is to do SOMETHING. In the first weeks postpartum, that was walking while hold my baby in a baby carrier, it made me feel better to move. I gave myself a goal of 5 minutes out and 5 minutes back and a few days later extended that walk longer and longer and within a few weeks was walking carrying him and dragging a sled behind me‚Ä¶finding just something to do and giving myself an objective helps keep the stir-crazy away.

Same for when I tore my bicep tendon and had shoulder surgery. I did an hour a day of rehab exercises and followed programming from my coach with movements that  I was cleared to do. The beauty of doing CrossFit is the huge (infinite?!) range of activities and movements you can practice."

&gt;Media outlets, after scouring archived news stories and video footage, could not find verified accounts of Jersey City Muslims rejoicing.

&gt;But in a new examination by NJ Advance Media, a police officer who worked on 9/11 and residents on the outskirts of Journal Square say they witnessed small pockets of people celebrating before the groups dispersed or were broken up by authorities.

&gt;The NJ Advance Media inquiry, encompassing more than two dozen interviews conducted since Nov. 25, found Trump's broad assertion that thousands of people cheered to be baseless. At the same time, the inquiry provides the first credible indication of at least two modest celebrations, as described by on-the-record sources who say they witnessed the behavior.

And the ""thousands"" of people that Trump said were celebrating?"

"I would really like to see the option to exclude motion detection from a section of the 2d-image (e.g., block off the area where the street in front of the house is visible).  Basically, the device would make a 2d-image of the IR and ignore changes in heat signatures in a certain section of the image.  It‚Äôs very similar to what other cameras do for motion detection, but combined with the IR sensors.

The IR-based detection is so easily tripped by cars, but ignoring heat signatures from the vertical strip where cars drive by would completely solve that issue, at least for me.  Ignoring that area wouldn‚Äôt miss humans unless they somehow fly over the pathway leading to my house.  

Imo, this would be leaps and bounds better than motion detection on other cameras (at least the ones I‚Äôve tried).  "

"They are too obviously fake and one of them has an ISIS flag?

This seems like a double false flag setup. It works like this:
  
 * CNN says Trump supporters did t

 * Someone notices the ISIS flag and notes that it is probably ISIS

 * A few days before the election someone at CNN ""finds"" a blurry video of a man in a red hat dropping yellow packages in people's companies' mailbox. ""Look everyone, we always knew it was those Trump supporters!""

See how it works? It is hard to say then ""ah but it is a fake false flag"" because it sounds dumb. But I think that is what they are going for.

Note, this happened with Guciffer 2.0. The plant they had giving the interview, pretended to be Romanian but oops! he got caught during his live interview that he didn't speak Romanian and was probably Russian. ""OMG look the smart people at Vice or wherever discovered the true hackers!"".

Think of it like a candy machine... you put in a coin, you get a candy.

With 10 floating mana you could activated the ability 10 times if you wanted... if you went to draw 4 cards that turn somehow, everyone would bounce 4 things (because each draw is replaced with one of those bounce effects), and the other 6 would wear off at end of turn."

"Maybe.  You gotta think of it from a perspective of profits.  How many people will buy a game that requires toys to play? How many people want to invest the cost of the game (or twice that) to get all of those toys?

Now how many people will buy a game that doesn't require toys, to play it like a traditional video game?

I'd wager the second number is many, many times larger.

So by making 'digital only' an option, they dramatically increase profits, essentially charging extra for DLC (Even if it's only $5 for all of them) and getting the sale of a game that would have been a lost sale from someone who isn't interested in buying toys. Not only that, the 'digital only' starter pack is the same price as the physical version, and includes no physical elements, which means it's a much greater profit margin, as there is no cost of producing and shipping the toys.

Ubisoft created a game that was able to appeal to a larger demographic, and that's the smart thing to do. Will there be some people who might have bought the physical version if it was the only one available? I'm sure there were. Were the overall sales and profits of the game higher by offering both versions? You and I will never know, but the evidence would suggest it is. If anything, those of us who like the toys should be glad they did, as the profits created by the digital-only sales may provide incentive to keep the game alive, increasing the chance of more toys for the rest of us."

"It will come with time! I think you will understand scales and keys better with some playing experience when you can see what they do - the patterns of scales and arpeggios and chords just makes it easier for us to play when we can recognise/memorize the clump of notes as a pattern instead of having to read each one. 

Circle of fifths is helpful to memorize and it's a really cool bit of music theory, but I would hardly say it's necessary for now. Maybe after you've played for a while it will be nice to revisit and see how you can memorize the keys and their flats and sharps. 

It's important to note that music theory is descriptive and not prescriptive - it's there to tell us what works in the past, not necessarily rules to follow. Scales and all that aren't some rigid construct, but they're really just patterns people found to be nice sounding in the past, and we learn them now because those scales still have a significant role in our music today. 

Middle C is called such because it's the middle of the [grand stave](https://i.stack.imgur.com/XGqc4.jpg) between the two staves of the clefs. It's important to note that the two staves are continuous - they could combine into 10 lines and function the same way, but are split into two for readability. 

Middle C just happens to be a convienient reference point that everyone knows - it will always be notated in the way above. If a composer wants a C that isn't in that octave, he'd write a C somewhere else [further up or down](http://www.sengpielaudio.com/OktavEinteilung.gif). 

For legibility we don't usually use as many ledger lines as the extreme ends suggest - in practice we would only use maybe C2 to C6. If a composer wanted an octave beyond that, he'd write [8va for an octave higher or 8vb for an octave lower](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cYXcC.png), and 15va for 2 octaves and so on. 

The grand staff itself contains around 4 octaves, so if composers want to move around between those octaves then they'd just write the notes in a different spot (higher or lower).

Regarding no E# and B#, this is really just down to the structure of our diatonic scale system, but that's not that satisfying of an answer. 

The short version of the history is a long time ago someone (the Greeks if I'm not mistaken) found out if you divide octaves into 12 semitones, they sound good and this has been the base of much of Western music ever since. They then discovered a certain 8 notes in succession produced a really nice sound - this became the major scale with the pattern as mentioned before. Many instruments after ended up having just those 8 notes instead of the full 12 because they were deemed the ""important"" notes for playing with other people. 

The keyboard instruments eventually had those 8 notes as 'white notes' partially because of that and partially because some kind of pattern was needed to recognise where notes are - imagine just 88 white keys in a row! The black keys were then put between the white keys to 'fill in the gaps' - and due to the scale pattern, there just aren't any semitones between E and F that they could jam a black key in. We then ended up with the pattern we have today. 

As /u/EntropyOrSloth noted, E# and F aren't exactly the same in strings, winds and singing - they will play both those notes very slightly different instead of the same on piano, as well as F# and Gb and any other enharmonic equivalents. This is a product of piano not being exactly in tune (lots of [mathematical reasons](https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/metro.co.uk/2015/09/18/its-impossible-to-tune-a-piano-5398180/amp/) but basically the piano tuning system is one big compromise).

I remember doing base in treble cleft on a bari sax or contra bass sax.  I remember it was bigger than my bari sax just this massive thing.  Like how bass clarinets look almost like a sax.  It takes a lot of lung capacity for bari, contra, and piccalo.

You're confusing binocular vision with depth perception.  Functionally there is little difference in depth perception between someone that has one eye vs two.  Its a misconception due to the temporary reduction during the transitional period when someone loses an eye.  But when studied it turned out people with long term monocular vision had the same depth perception.  The difference ended up falling within the natural range for everyone.

A good manager has good leadership skills and trusts in their team to get the job done and to be able to take proper direction.    If you are being told to do one thing by your manager, and then this same manager recants their directions to you and tells you to always confirm with them, this absolutely sounds like an incompetent manager and I would have this addressed before office politics get in the way.

"It's not any more unfinished than any other battlefield game. Why is this game unfinished while Battlefield 3,4,Hardline, and 1 all dont have br modes. 

If it's not worth it, dont buy it. I don't know why you have to call it unfinished. It is finished. The finish line is set by EA and Dice and the hit it. They decide when it's finished. Not you.

Here is another handy tip, don't pretend that the game is unfinished or finished when it feel like it makes sense to do that simply to bring down the games sales for no good reason. 


Buy it when it reaches the value it's worth. I personally think it's probably going to be worth $60 at launch so I'll buy it at that price. I also know there will be more content later on so yay. This battlefield game has enough content on it's own. That makes it a full game.i don't understand the insistence on admitting you don't have a good reason to call it incomplete. It's stupid.

"Hardships are mostly the same as any other labour job, but I'd say timings. The time to unload x container seemed to be completely random and had almost no relation to the contents or volume. We mostly did steel bars of various sizes, 2/3 men over the shoulder and racked in the warehouse. Half the guys there (including myself the last month) were on prescription painkillers just to get through the day. It really could be cruisey or hell depending on the given time lottery for that container. Highlight stories include becoming one of the team the day I called my boss a ""fucking fat cunt"", and witnessing the dickhead sales guy get his car STUCK on a speedbump, causing literally the entire warehouse to empty, point and laugh.

"&gt; BotW's shrines and especially the 4 titans are way closer to actually being great puzzle design.

The dungeons yes, although they are very short. I actually think they're probably the best in the series.

The shrines, absolutely not. There are a few decent ones, but there have always been a few good puzzles in most recent Zelda games. At best, I would estimate that maybe 10% of the shrines are decent, and a considerable amount of the remainder are even worse than your average modern Zelda puzzle.

&gt; Metal attracts lighting during a thunderstorm, fire produces updraft, those kinds of interactions between two or more mechanics.

Sure this is impressive, but is it meaningful? How often do you exploit it? Does the game ever ask you to use it or push you to discover it? In my experience with the game, it was basically ""oh, neat"" and that was it. They're fun when you discover them and they make for great YouTube videos (I'm not just being facetious: the YouTube videos that initially came out of the game really were great, I was impressed by the interactions too!), but the interest rarely goes beyond ""I wonder if I could..."". I also think you seriously overestimate just how many such interactions there are - ""hundreds"" is really a stretch (unless you're counting, say, every object that can be stasised separately).

Like so many things in the game, all of those interactions could have been used to do really interesting things. But they weren't. Because the game can't push you towards discovering the interactions then have you do things with them since the shrines have no ordering. Imagine if a puzzle had a bunch of burning ground you used with your glider then a later puzzle had just some grass and a torch, then a puzzle involved lightning being drawn to a metal lightning rode, then finally you had a field and a piece of metal during a storm and you had to put it all together. That would be neat!

It isn't that the game lacks the sort of mechanics that would make for interesting challenges, it's that the structure largely precludes interesting challenges. The few places where it can actually sequence some things, like the 4 little dungeons, are far and away the tightest.

&gt; I still think it deserves some respect for offering a genuinely fresh take on the standard model of open world AAA singleplayer design.

I also disagree pretty strongly with this line. It's a fresh take on Zelda (although arguably not entirely fresh - it's clearly inspired by the first game). I don't think it's a particularly fresh take on open-world games. It's clearly following in the footsteps of the modern ""map full of icons"" open-world game, the kind Ubisoft loves to churn out. The different vignettes that dot the landscape are perhaps a little more obviously themed (there's almost always an obvious gimmick you can exploit for each little camp), but ultimately it's very much the same formula. Hell, it even includes a material collection and crafting system like every other open-world game (although I think Skyward Sword had already done that to a degree)!

As an aside, I actually think that you are right that the little camps are one of the best features of the game. It's clear that a lot of care went into them, and while I think any difference there relative to most open-world games is more a matter of degree, I do think they're very strong. I think a good comparison would be enemy placement in Dark Souls. In many ways, I think the little camps are almost always better puzzles than the shrines. But again, I wish the game recognized that more! I pretty quickly found myself simply running around the little enemy encampments to get where I was going unless they were holding something unusually desirable. The game also does re-use a lot of concepts between the camps too though - there are quite a few where the mechanical gimmick the camp is set up to highlight is almost exactly the same."

"&gt;I feel like the way Trump will be able to secure any type of election is to at minimum support some type of solid Marijuana reform legislation. As divided as voters are right now it‚Äôs one of the few topics that have so dramatically shifted into a positive.

Oh, by taking one of Clinton's 2016 policies?

Legalizing weed is popular among voters on both sides of the aisle, but it's not a central issue that would make a voter switch party allegiance. Legalized weed is just a matter of time, and for some of us in blue states, it's already a reality. 

An R voter isn't going to start ignoring the 2nd amendment fearmongering and ignore his opposition to legalized abortion to vote for someone like Clinton who ran in 2016 with a policy to legalize weed. 

A D voter isn't going to ignore the Republican attacks on minority rights and racist rhetoric about immigration, or betray their pro-choice beliefs, to vote for a Republican hypothetically promoting policy towards legalized weed. 

It's a popular issue, but it's not a single issue that is enough to motivate voters by itself. "

"Foda que eu ia comentar l√° mas j√° trancaram o post. Ent√£o vai aqui mesmo, carta aberta. Eu espero que pelo menos eu possa ser ouvido mesmo que s√≥ um pouco, ou mesmo tomando chuva de downvote. u/platypup u/tetizeraz u/Caos2

Eu s√≥ estou aqui por um motivo: **eu desprezo toda e qualquer forma de censura, n√£o importa o vi√©s pol√≠tico**. Se aqui nesse sub tivesse do mesmo jeito que l√° no /r/brasil, eu mandava os dois √† merda e dava unsub. Mas pelo menos aqui eu posso falar isso, porque apesar do ""tom de merda"" que eu possa estar transmitindo (e com certeza devo estar), eu sou livre pra falar. A matem√°tica √© simples. Eu desprezo os dois extremos pol√≠ticos, mas eu desprezo mais ainda o extremo que aplica a censura como modo de controle. Por isso eu vim pra c√°, aqui eu n√£o sinto o ""medo psicol√≥gico"" de falar o que penso sem tomar marretada na cara. E √© por isso que esse sub recebeu tanta gente nesses √∫ltimos tempos.

Infelizmente o jeito que a grande maioria do /r/brasil t√° agindo agora simplesmente faz invi√°vel toda e qualquer discuss√£o sobre pol√≠tica. Eu tive sorte de s√≥ ter levado mass downvote e tou at√© feliz por isso, sendo que eu me mantenho neutro o m√°ximo poss√≠vel pra n√£o acabar dando merda pra um lado nem pro outro. Mas s√©rio, esse ano foi de longe o **pior** pra aguentar ambos os lados. √â uma merda reconhecer que o coment√°rio de algu√©m que eu n√£o lembro agora condiz tanto com a realidade n√£o s√≥ do sub mas sim do brasileiro como pessoa:

&gt; Se eu falar que voto no PT, os Bolsominions me batem. Se eu falar que voto no Bolsonaro, os petistas me batem. Se eu falar que voto nulo, me chamam de isent√£o e tomo porrada dos dois.

**Esse √© o principal motivo pelo qual eu n√£o gosto de interagir com brasileiros na internet.** A gente nem pode pensar em abrir a boca que j√° √© julgado pelos dois lados s√≥ por respirar e existir. Eu n√£o vejo isso em outros pa√≠ses mais civilizados, por mais ""acirrado"" que seja. Os Estados Unidos s√£o bem mais competitivos que a gente, mas quando um partido ganha e o outro perde, os dois lados se unem em prol de quem venceu para se manterem unidos e manterem vivos o conceito de ""na√ß√£o"". Ser um bom perdedor em termos leigos. Aqui no Brasil n√£o tem isso. Nunca teve. Tudo nesse pa√≠s sempre foi regado √† rivalidade e ""n√£o aceitar perder"", mas quando √© com gente de fora a gente parece que muda do nada ""pra ingl√™s ver"". Por exemplo, eu sempre achei a coisa mais retardada do mundo a rivalidade que o Brasil e a Argentina t√™m no futebol, que os EUA e o Canad√° tem com... seja l√° o que for. S√≥ que entre Brasil e Argentina ainda nos consideramos ""hermanos"". Entre EUA e Canad√° ainda se consideram ""brothers"". Entre Brasil e Brasil t√° todo mundo se matando porque ningu√©m t√° usando o lado racional, s√≥ t√° usando o emocional.

A √∫nica coisa que eu gostaria de entender √© por que n√£o d√° pra deixar a pol√≠tica totalmente de lado no /r/brasil e deixar essa parte pros subs que realmente foram feitos pra isso - esse sub pra direita e o /r/brasildob pra esquerda. J√° que foi justamente essa merda desse t√≥pico que fudeu tudo. Eu nem cansado to mais, eu to √© triste de ver todo dia a mesma coisa. A√≠ eu pessoalmente acabo me voltando de novo pra gringa, porque √© um esfor√ßo mental que todo mundo t√° cansado de fazer porque todo mundo √© bombardeado o tempo todo com histeria.

Por favor. Eu n√£o me importo se voc√™s s√£o todos um bando de comunas ou um bando de nazistas, se o Bolsonaro vai ganhar e transformar o pa√≠s numa Auschwitz ou se o Haddad vai ganhar e transformar o pa√≠s numa Venezuela, vamos pelo amor de Deus tentar ser um povo mais civilizado e racional, e menos tribal e atrasado."

That appears to be candid footage taken from their cameras, but it could easily be fake. I couldn‚Äôt find one for Nest at https://www.ispot.tv/brands/ntn/nest-home-security. It still could be an ad, but you need more proof.

"No, sadly. The budget refuses to allow for it. As of now, he is sitting in a locked storage container, awaiting his rebuild. Eventually. I hope.

As to the Cyprus, its not the same bike that was sold to me. I've been through it wheel to wheel. Nothing Honda is on the bike, nor Yamaha in the engine ( its a 260cc Linhai/Yamaha horizontal)  but OEM parts. That's not what makes the difference mostly. It's two things that immediately tell of a bikes origins. Fit and finish, and ride quality. Now I've rebuilt Betsy the Cyprus, fresh paint, new rubber shoes, and all bearings and bushing have been swapped..so fit and finish is an obvious as 9.5-10/10.... If I do say so myself. The ride quality was done with *good* shocks and real tires, not Kenda recycled condoms. 

So, you now have a bike that looks exactly like a Honda Reflex, (save the obvious engine orientation, which oddly never gets noticed) and it rides like its 8k counterpart. It has no badges, no tags, as I didn't buy them back, and the panels have **no** wiggle and wammy. 

The ride is actually much better on the Cyprus than poor Felix the Helix, but that's due to the age, and style of both being *VASTLY* different. The Cyprus is more of a street bike like thing, while Felix is a day Cruiser. One is meant to cut the curves, one to sail the asphalt. 

Changing the shocks and bearings out was the smartest thing I ever did. I did use OEM replacements for *a* Yamaha, but not what it was listed for, just happened to be the right size. I also rebuilt the fork tunes with new valves, seals, and oil. The gunk that came from the original oil...Oh My Gawd, it was like something I would write about in my book....."

Psalm 33:6

    and by the breath of his mouth all their host.

Ezekiel 37:9-10 

&gt;	Then he said to me, ‚ÄúProphesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.‚Äù

Job 34:14-15

&gt;	If he should set his heart to it
   and gather to himself his spirit and his breath, all flesh would perish together,

"I'm in the same boat man.  I did the grind to masters the first few months I played then I just lost interest in the grind.  To be effective requires you to play on meta (or ahead of meta) decks and invest a lot \[relative to my available time\] of time in, neither of which appealed to me.  Mostly I sit in bronze/silver/gold now just from a 1 win a day, and streaks to empty my quest log once a week or so.  


I also like how responsive the computer is vs. human.  I can understand taking some time to consider your options but often I'm staring at a board where I know basically what they have in their hand and there is only one good play.  


And of course the main reason is that I prefer to play janky decks.  There are some jank decks that perform well on the ladder but the majority of stuff I enjoy doesn't.

They'll end the year with over 200 billion in revenue and have a market cap only 4x that.

"I built one using a Micronode Teensy and 2 Mototola CDM-1250 or CDM-1550 Radios and a Raspberry Pi running Pi-Star.  The hardest part of this setup is a) cooling the radios, b) making the interface cables.  In all, once I got the cables made it just sort of worked.  

I am currently waiting on a duplexer from Hong Kong to complete the build, and once I have that, the total build will have cost me under $1000.  The radios were about $150 each, the duplexer was $100, the teensy was $180, the pi another $30.  There was a couple hundred for cables, coax, and antenna as well to get the thing all setup.

I originally had a 10mW hotspot, and it worked when I was in the house; didn't cut it when I was walking the dog; so I went big and I can now get the repeater from 15miles away."

"I figured this out recently. 8-12 hours prep, 15ish minutes cook time.

1 cup rice, 2 cups water. Combine in a pot, cover and let sit for about 8 hours or more. Bring to a boil and turn down really low to where the water is just barely boiling. Set a timer for 15 minutes. At this point DON‚ÄôT FUCKING TOUCH ANYTHING! When timer goes off, remove from heat and fluff with a fork.

It is very important to keep the rice covered for the entire duration of prep and cooking.

Enjoy your perfect rice."

At the same time, if I used those hookup apps and noticed that someone listed ""No Fems"" on their profile or something, it'd probably put me off of talking to them, even just as a potential friend.

You're certainly welcome to seek partners who are clean, but perhaps it would be better to ask on an individual level rather than having it posted in your profile?

I do encourage that even if your partners are clean, that you use condoms. People can lie or just be wrong, and if you're having casual sex you can't really judge their character well.

On October 4, 2012, Daulerio posted a short clip of Hulk Hogan and Heather Clem, the estranged wife of Todd Alan Clem, having sex.[41] Hogan sent Gawker a cease-and-desist order to take the video down, but Denton refused. Denton cited the First Amendment and argued the accompanying commentary had news value. Judge Pamela Campbell issued an injunction ordering Gawker to take down the clip.[42] In April 2013, Gawker wrote, ""A judge told us to take down our Hulk Hogan sex tape post. We won't."" It also stated that ""we are refusing to comply"" with the order of the circuit court judge.[43][44]

Gawker's actions have been criticized as hypocritical since they heavily criticized other media outlets and websites for publishing nude pictures of celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence‚Äînude pictures that the celebrities in question had taken of themselves.[45]

Hogan filed a lawsuit against Gawker and Denton for violating his privacy, asking for $100 million in damages; the trial was slated for July 2015.[46] The cost of the lawsuit was partly funded by Peter Thiel,[47] whom Gawker had previously outed in 2007.[48] In January 2016, Gawker Media received its first outside investment by selling a minority stake to Columbus Nova Technology Partners. Denton stated that the deal was reached in part to bolster its financial position in response to the Hogan case.[49]

In March 2016, Hulk Hogan was awarded $140 million in damages by a Florida jury in an invasion of privacy case over Gawker's publication of a sex tape: on March 18, Hogan was awarded $55 million for economic harm and $60 million for emotional distress;[50][51] on March 21, 2016, the jury awarded Hogan a further $25 million in punitive damages.[52] On November 2, Gawker reached a $31 million settlement with Hogan.[53]"

"Statics is a relatively challenging course with a pretty heavy course load and a strong dependence on doing practice problems for success. Nohra doesn‚Äôt pull any punches and prides himself on being a gatekeeper in the engineering department. 

I‚Äôm not saying that you can‚Äôt take any other courses with statics, but I would be mindful of the course load for any additional courses, as his will carry enough weight for most. His class moves very quickly in the summer and leaves you with very little time to fall behind. If you get one class behind in the summer, you will fight tooth and nail to get caught up. 

If you decide to take statics in the summer, take my advice. Do as many of his listed homework problems as you possibly can. I don‚Äôt recall if he collects homework in the summer, but he will provide you with a list of homework/practice problems to do. There will be several for each chapter, so I suggest you do as many as you can handle. Also, his quiz questions come directly from the reading and the provided homework problems. Doing these will give you a leg up. 

Statics and Dynamics become a strong foundation for several of your classes moving forward. "

"[](/raralaugh) Oh hey, someone else who's gone this route. Yeah, it pays quite well if you're good at it. Cloppers seem to have deep pockets, especially for the more uhm... nuanced commissions.

That being said, I'm not sure if the majority of the life-sizes are for sex. Like, Derpi is still 70% completely safe. I would imagine that life sizes are closer to about 60% clean. Most ones that I've seen sold have been clean, but it's not like I've made any.

As for the vote ratios on Derpi: I think you have to realise that only users who have accounts can vote. And why might you get an account? Well... people like having having filters for things. So it's always, always going to be skewed towards the things which users sign up accounts for.

But in any case, I get why people buy life sizes. While I've been lucky to have a great sex life with my boyfriend, I can see how not having any chance at a relationship can make people desperate."

"A nice way to do it is spend a weekend outdoor.  Getting up with the sunrise will very quickly reset your inner clock.

The preferred way to set your sleep schedule is simply to strictly adhere to it and practice good sleep hygiene. A few basics:

- Go to bed the same time every day
- Get up the same time every day
- No matter if you‚Äôre sleeping or not, stay in bed for this period, and this period only
- Don‚Äôt do anything else in bed. Don‚Äôt use it to nap, read, watch TV, whatever. Use your bed only for sleeping
- If you take naps, use a distinct place for this as well
- Don‚Äôt look at screens about an hour before going to bed

If you adhere to these rules, your body will adjust to them. You‚Äôll be conditioned to sleep in your bed at a specific time and will wake up well rested.

"Leibniz argues that everything that exists was created. However, William Craig expands this in his book ""On Guard"" by arguing that things can exist in one of two ways:

1) necessarily - simply out of their own necessity to exist. For example, the number 1. It was never created, it simply exists out of its own necessity to exist.
2) contingently - simply due to being created by something else. My book exists because I created it.

Craig's argument is that the universe exists contingently on God creating it, however, God exists necessarily out of his own necessity to exist. Which is supported by scripture -- he always has existed and always will, he was never created nor will he ever be destroyed.

Of course one can refute that argument. I won't get into details, because Craig does a fine job at addressing the counterarguments. Check it out.

Hope this makes sense. 10/10 would recommend the book."

"STOP RIGHT THERE, LAWBREAKER! YOU VIOLATED THE LAW! PAY THE FINE OR GO TO JAIL!"
"1. Keep the paralegal in the loop regarding case and firm issues. Once I worked for attorneys that ever told me anything unless I asked (which required me interrupting the attorney while they working, which they didnt really like either). Cases would settle, meditations and depositions were rescheduled, etc and I had no idea. It was frustrating because the paralegal is there to make your life easier. This can be accomplished by simply CC'ing the paralegal on your emails. My favorite attorneys CC'd me on EVERYTHING. It seems like over kill but I was able to anticipate the needs of the attorney based on the conversation the attorney was having with clients and opposing counsel.

&amp;#x200B;

2) What Florida Paralegal says before. E-mailed tasks are the best.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Please dont blame the paralegals for every bad or unfortunate thing that happens. If you need an outlet, find one outside of the firm, like a therapist. Good paralegals are hard to find and unless you are compensating a paralegal very well, they wont stick around for the abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Law firms are high stress, as you know. But attorneys have unique benefits to the stress that paralegals dont receive. Little acknowledgements of appreciation go a very long way. If you are in a metro area, paralegals can easily jump ship and go to a different firm. Make sure your paralegals feel valued. Money is the best and easiest way. I once worked for a firm that underpaid the paralegals and had no bonuses, they thought they were doing the paralegals a favor by buying lunch once a week... nah. Every single paralegal got together and quit at the same time. Now if you are solo or cant afford it, the paralegals will understand. If you deny them raises and bonuses but show up with a brand new Tesla and talk about your new heated pool, you're going to run into a problem.

"It's too bad the family didn't release a bit more info since many people had time and energy invested in trying to find him, but it is understandable that their grieving comes before satisfying the curiosity of the public.  The speculation will continue but to me it is pretty obvious - if there is no foul play suspected then the scene would have to be fairly cut and dry.  It isn't logical what he did (leave car running and go on a cross country hike and have an accident that resulted in his death) so I think it can be said with some certainty it was a suicide.  The closest walking distance from where his car was to the Chemainus River is 8.7km, which is less than a 2 hour walk, and would have put him in the Chemainus Park - the elevation change isn't huge, he didn't have to go over a mountain, and other than the very start could have walked on roads with no houses or traffic.  This shows the route he could have taken: [https://goo.gl/maps/KcoPGkuBWdG2](https://goo.gl/maps/KcoPGkuBWdG2)"

"Each person is unique, but I would encourage you to consider making new lifestyle choices that create opportunities to connect with like-minded people. Especially since you are no longer with your wife, for a sense of personal fulfillment it will be worthwhile to have meaningful experiences with people. A foreign place can quickly lose its charm if you begin to feel disassociated with the flow of daily life there. Perhaps this can be assuaged by making an effort to meet up with other travelers and social groups. If you're fine with solo travel, then your plans may take into account the possible adventures and new experiences. I just know as a traveler without any roots, eventually loneliness can revivify the human need for friends and companionship. At any rate, a healthy amount of trust and faith in your process is invaluable. Best wishes on your journey :) "

Just as well, you should always cast the person that will best serve the movie.

Should we have given the role to a person who actually has the disease for the representation? Was Eddie Redmayne in the wrong to play a man transitioning as a woman in The Danish Girl?

"Trans people are also 0.004% of the population. SAG, according to google, has 124,000 members total. You have to consider how many of these are in SAG but not working, bit players, extras etc. But even if, somehow, all of those actors were actively out working, that would mean you'd have about 500 total actors if those trans people were equally represented in Hollywood, which is a fucking stretch to assume so. 

Now, out of those presumed 500 trans actors, which I'd wager is probably about 1/3 to 1/4th that number, **if that**, you'd need one of them to be able to carry a film and gain financing with the same star power as SJO to get the movie made.

"I am considering studying Maths at uni in the UK next year, I also find the applications more interesting but what made you choose Maths over a joint degree say ""Maths and Computer Science"", also are the graduate prospects better than just a Maths teacher?

"You obviously take offense to the slightest provocation from people responding to your rather immature, self-righteous views on topics you tend to discuss. You fail to keep your cool and fly off the handle and spew a slurry of rambled words where you usually find yourself  trying-too-hard-to-be-philosopical guru or more likely a bunch of potty mouthed response. 

You aspire to be witty, mature, confident and articulate but you lay too much emphasis on how people perceive you, your outward appearances, your persona, your outlook, your upvotes and your karma and your likes. You try too hard to fit into your own self-idolised image - this cool, counter-culture, wordly, multi-talented being. It's tragic to know that you try so hard at it all and the ultimate thing is that your own bloated pride, self-importance and refusal of acknowledgement of it has led you to fail to cultivate any of it in any capacity of depth or character. Here you are left in a shallow pool of half complete ideas and fragments of witless comebacks trying to salvage your own bruised ego.

Certain issues do arrise, if you give yourself a weapon too early the game will crash because the level does not cache the gun model.

Camera research carries over but obtain the Brute splicers the normal way, you don't want to break progression by getting the drill dash too early.

"It's a fairly complicated subject matter as a lot of activities that come at a high cost, such as hiring and deploying public affairs consultants and professionals may not at times be considered an act of lobbying as it's not directly a part of attempts to influence legislation. In some cases it could be advantageous to a non-profit organization to make their lobbying expenses seem high (or in the case of 501(c)3 organizations make it look very low) whereas for corporations it may depend on a lot of different factors. Though, looking at big pharmaceuticals and organizations like Truth (which has nearly a billion dollars in assets on the books as of their last IRS form 990 reported), JUUL is not anywhere near that size.

"The advertising around micellar water as a makeup remover is just that--advertising.  It's a gentle surfactant that men can absolutely use, too.

I don't know that it's better or worse than a traditional face cleanser, but some people find some varieties to be more mild than regular cleansers.  

Oil cleansers are fabulous at removing makeup and water-resistant sunscreen, but they can also be great cleansers if you have oily skin. 

If you're happy with your Cerave hydrating cleanser I don't think you're missing out on anything, but you can absolutely try a new kind of cleanser if you see one that appeals to you."

I tend to read books from the library even if I have a bookshelf full of unread books so i want to pick up more of my own books (I dont have a number yet). My last goal is to go through  the history of French literature and pick up one or two books for each 'wave'. I haven't picked my titles yet but I'll choose from the French classics I stole from my dad.

"First, DO NOT RESTART CHROME.

Assuming you haven't restarted Chrome ever since you lost your bookmarks, this should still be possible. I am not sure of the exact procedure on Macs because I do not use them, but this should still work. If this doesn't work on one computer, try it on another one because, chances, are it may be on one of them.

1. Open your file browser and navigate to `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/` on Mac,
`C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\ on windows`, or
`/home/username/.config/google-chrome/` in Linux
2. If you have only one profile in Chrome, or if it was the first account you signed in with, there will be a folder called `Default`, otherwise, it may be in a folder called something like `Profile 1`. If this is the case, there is no easy way to tell which is which, I would say the best way to tell would be by the `Google Profile Picture.png`.
3. Once you figure out which folder belongs to your main Google account, you will see two files called `Bookmarks` and `Bookmarks.bak`. Copy both to a safe place, in case something goes wrong, but keep this folder open.
4. Close out of Chrome completely.
5. Delete the `Bookmarks` (not `Bookmarks.bak`!) file from the Chrome folder, and create a copy of `Bookmarks.bak` and rename it to `Bookmarks`.
6. Turn off all forms of internet connection.
7. Re-open Chrome. If your old bookmarks are back, it worked, but you are not finished.
8. In the address bar, type `chrome://bookmarks`
9. Click the 3 dot menu in the top right of the bookmark manager, and click ""Export bookmarks"", then choose where to save it.
10. Turn your internet connection back on, and wait for Chrome to sync. It will most likely replace your bookmarks with the ones from Chrome sync.
11. In the bookmark manager, open the menu and, this time, choose ""Import bookmarks"" and select the exported bookmarks html file that you exported earlier. Chrome should then merge those bookmarks with your current ones.

As I said earlier, If this doesn't work, try it on as many computers that you may be logged into as possible, as there is a chance that the bookmarks may still be on one."

Personally I think they're fine right now. Shaolin is technical no unreactable 50/50 nonsense or overtuned bash. Just really good mix up potential just like Kensei. This is coming from someone who doesn't even have the Wulin but I've fought against plenty. They're new and alien ppl don't really know how to fight optimally against them. Same thing everytime new heroes drop honestly. I went straight into arena and booted up the Wulin to get a general idea of how to fight against them and I've had a blast fighting against Shaolin. None of the Wulin are anymore stronger then the current top tier picks like Kensei, HL, Zerk, conq, or warden and they're alot funner to fight then warden or conq to me."

 From now, everybody just mention the need of imported workforce, i now they really rally for capitalist, not the workers the say they want into jobs. It's lies. Nothing more.

    The only reason I mention that is because you didn't deny having anything to do with that marking. If you didn't, then I'd say the first step is to determine what caused the damage, because I've never personally seen something like that (I'm guessing something to do with overclocking might have caused it, but that's a laymans guess.)     
     
Also ask the customer if its still working. If not, maybe ask him to show a picture of it not working (which might only be possible if it has leds or rgb, since the fans dont always spin).

"Many reasons, but in general: it was not only a more recent and modern war than the previous world war, but much more destructive and honestly, it was a fairly clear-cut ""good vs. bad guys"" war, at least from a modern perspective. I mean, just look at the Nazis... they literally blitzkrieg-ed the shit out of Europe, committed industrialised genocide against undesirable races, tried to conquer ""living space"" for their racially pure nation and so on - all while wearing these insanely stylish bad guy uniforms with skulls and what not. 

Y'know how a lot fantasy tropes were invented by J.R.R. Tolkien? The Nazis pretty much did the same - they set the cultural standard for the ultimate evil, they were the real-life equivalent of the Galactic Empire from Star Wars.

Hello again, you axe throwing superstars! Great news! The new zombie survival mode is here! Here, you'll get to throw axes at the undead (don't worry, though, it's all in a very cartoony style that's unlikely to freak anyone out too much!) to see how long you can survive. It's high score chasing again, so there's a brand new leaderboard specially for survival. To start the game, use the lever on the main menu to move the menu two targets to the right .. and there it is! Survival! We really hope you enjoy this whole new game mode. The timing couldn't be better, either, with it being that Halloweeny time of year and all - makes this new mode the perfect accompaniment to your Halloween VR party! So, to all you axe throwers, have a happy, safe Halloween. Thank you once again for all your suggestions, comments, support and awesome reviews! I can't tell you how much they mean to PsychicParrot.

"&gt; Sure, its more secure. But its not a night and day kind of difference. Even with no epistemology at all, you have an intuitive idea of how you can know things. So it goes from some arbitrary level of knowledge to a little more

How do we know the magnitude? It seems like a pretty fundamental and striking difference

&gt;Philosophy as a distinct field apart from these practices is certainly useful, but its not really as all encompassing as being a basic necessity.

Not a necessity for action, sure. But for knowledge?

&gt;You might not be able to describe how knowledge works from the ground up, but the practice of fields doesn't require it for your knowledge to be raising. Similar to how you don't really need to be a biologist to be an athlete, since for the latter your biology just kind of works.

You‚Äôre conflating knowledge and action. Do you disagree that they are different? Do you think a ball rolling down the hill has knowledge because it does something?"

"This type of stamp is one of those weird forever stamps.  When they moved from the lick and stick, to the peel and stick type with adhesive on the back, they included in them a way to prevent reuse.  Basically, if you try peeling the stamps off, it will tear them apart and depending on the type, show a ""void"" mark across it.  The reason for this is two fold.  First, it prevents reuse, and second, it's not uncommon for packages of odd sizes and shapes, to not be put through the machine that voids the stamps.  (https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1VjF4IVXXXXXlXXXXq6xXFXXX7/High-Speed-Postmark-Stamping-Machine-Date-Time.jpg_350x350.jpg)  Post offices use one similar to this.  Whatever the case, the built in ability to void themselves if attempted to be reused, means that the post office doesn't have to post mark everything.  So, it's not unheard of for odd things, or odd shaped items (such as the envelope in the image) to pass through without a post mark.

Who have the highest drop rate for baha horns proto bahamut or grand order ?
I dunno about cheaper but there's places where you simply will have to import food because it can't grow locally or because of seasonal changes. Winter in the Northern Hemisphere means it's summer in the Southern and that increases food availability during a time which it would be inherently be scarce. Canada is a major food importer because of how far north it is.

- his children are vaccinated.
- he believes vaccination is best practice.
- affirms current law.
- doesn't advocate policy change.
- confirms you penalize your child by not vaccinating. 
- believes the government should not force you to inject drugs into your children, depending on the vaccine. 

Last item is obviously the one people will key in on but it's obviously a play for tea party support (not surprising as it was a tea party event). 

Possibly the most wishy washy stance on vaccinations I've ever seen.

"**Homage** is a minion master/trump who links to other shards through physical contact and installs a bud from that shard into an object that is in the likeness of the shard's host.  Essentially, he's able to animate action figures in the likeness of actual capes, though he's limited to creating a single doll for any given shard he contacts for the duration of the cycle.  Each doll contains a copy of the personality and memories of the template, with the addition of a vague but absolute sense of loyalty toward Homage.  They won't share their secrets with him if they wouldn't otherwise, but they will go out of their way to keep him safe.  The dolls have a miniaturized version of their template's powers for any metric that is size relevant, however, unless their power includes a brute rating, they are no more durable than the doll materials they're made from.

This is based on a character for a story I'm working on, but I'm having trouble nailing down his trigger event.  If you want to contribute in a general sense, I'd appreciate it, but he has some backstory for context if you're interested.  He's Asian, lives in ABB territory with his mom and little sister.  His dad was killed in gang crossfire and his older brother died after being recruited by the ABB when they promised to keep his family safe.  He triggers around Bakuda's takeover of the ABB."

"How can you call yourself a libertarian?

I took the liberty of looking through your comment history. You're just a bog standard authoritarian loon who likes guns.

'Black's are stupid so they should have to go to their own schools'. 'You should be able to kill Democrats as a means of self defence'. 'Women shouldn't be allowed to wear head scarfs'. 'Gays aren't natural and as such don't deserve rights'. 'Tarrifs are good'. 'Muslims are evil' etc.

And plastered between all the petty 'cuck' and 'communists' insults you try to purport the idea that Trump is a libertarian? The most libertarian president ever? What laws has he taken down? I'll concede that a tax cut is a step in the right direction but adding tariffs and increasing spending has made the economy so much worse.

I don't think you quite understand what a libertarian stands for. Libertarians are closer to liberals than Trump. 90% of this subreddit wants gay Mexicans in gimp suits to enter the country with as little hassle as possible. Libertarians are fine with school teachers dressing as drag queens. Libertarians are fine with Islamic police officers. The only overlap with Trump and Libertarians are guns. "

"EDIT: HOHOHOHO Thank you kindly, dear sir! It seems it worked! Yes, it looks like I have access to recipes in books as long as a non-illiterate NPC is next to me in a relatively well-lit area. This changes things! THIS ABSOLUTELY CHANGES THINGS FOR ME! :D  The NPC tho must pass the requirements of the book in order for them to read it for you. For now I can let her skim books I don't know yet, but once skimmed if those books are way above her league then that's that until I get another NPC that can satisfy said requirements.

STUDY BUDDIES ARE FUCKEN AWESOME, I tell you what. I'm so happy right now, hahahaha.


Trying to \[R\]ead just gives me a list of books with ""You're illiterate!"" with no other options displayed. I'll have to check if NPC has to be nearby and if my NPC isn't also illiterate (pretty sure she's not, but she's fully Rat now, so...)

A lot of math goes into the internet such as number theory (encryption).  


Basic physics requires calculus at a minimum.

Advanced physics can use huge amounts of math.  A good amount of math has been invented for that purpose.  General relativity requires differential geometry.

"They are arbitrations. Both the defendant and plaintiff sign a contract agreeing to have their case decided by a third-party arbitrator, which in this case is Judge Judy. 

You are correct that she doesn‚Äôt really adhere to legal principles or evidentiary law like a civil court judge would. But she is under no obligation to do so, as the arbitration contract probably gives her carte blanche authority to decide the case in whatever way she deems fit.

"Nazis!

The chief ideologue of the Nazi party (more properly die NSDAP, or Nazionalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei) was a man named Alfred Rosenberg.

After the war many Nazis fled to Argentina, but one of them - Richard Walther Darr√© - was an Argentinian who joined the NSDAP and rose through the ranks of the SS to become seventh most senior commander.

Baldur von Schirach, head of the Hitlerjugend, was half American, and didn't learn to speak German until he was five.

"I agree. Maybe its not everyone, but healthy ways to release anger or aggression are difficult to come by in a world that says to hold all of that in.

Oui
"&gt;&gt;your type tell women all the time...
&gt;
&gt;I think by reading my comments here you can tell I don't tell women anything, given I avoid them like they have the bubonic plague. 

Well, you're failing miserably at that since you're talking to a woman right now. Perhaps you should ""go your own way"" and fuck off. 

&gt;&gt;I'm claiming her report was false
&gt;
&gt;I'm claiming your story is false. I have no opinion about a report that may or may not exist. 
&gt;

Semantics. You're claiming I am lying about my friend's rape, which is the same as saying that you do not believe my friend's rape happened. That was my point in my second comment: you are invalidating her rape by claiming it didn't happen. 

&gt;&gt;Never once have I claimed that it doesn't happen 
&gt;
&gt;So have you campaigned for them to get the death penalty, like all pedophiles should? 
&gt;

No. I don't believe in the death penalty for anyone, not in the least because it somehow manages to cost taxpayers even more money than just keeping them in jail for life. I do believe in equal jail time for equal crimes, however. 

&gt;&gt;men say ""lol I wish it were me"" 
&gt;
&gt;From my experience, half of those are joking and the other half are feminist alt accounts. 

From my experience, these are men in real life who honestly believe that men can't be raped. Granted, I know women in real life who believe this, too. None of them are people I am particularly fond of, for what I hope are obvious reasons. 

&gt;&gt;deserves to be in jail
&gt;
&gt;Nah, child rape deserves death. 

I hesitate to say that anyone should be able to decide who lives and who dies, but I grant that if you believe in the death penalty, child rape would be among the short list of things that deserve it. "

"we are talking about halloween costumes here. If a kid wants to dress up as a native american warchief or something, more power to him. For a little boy or girl it means they think native americans are cool and has nothing to do with whatever strange ideas of ""appropriation"" busy-bodies like you assign to the practice

so yeah I guess you are shitting on that

as for myself I stopped dressing up in costumes well before I turned 12. I don't understand why adults do it. It's tacky and really only works if its part of a larger performance play/opera/etc.

I've seen zero adults dress up as native americans or whatever. It's something kids do. The fact that so few adults engage in the practice of dressing up in ""non-PC"" costumes is why it makes the news whenever some controversy arises over it, because it's unbelievable to so many people.

Lots of the animals in the region this happened have actually been hunted with contraceptive darts so they can't actually reproduce.

"The angle between my forearm and the top of my hand when I bend it as far as I can (under my own strength) is only 135 degrees, or a negative 45 degree angle. I can't imagine having my wrist bent as far as the guy in that photo; it honestly looks like it's already broken but he's smiling about it!

Edit: if I push my wrist I can get it to a 90 degree angle before it starts to hurt. It just wasn't meant to bend that way lol"

"I don't think it's stated that Frieza trained at all. He specifically states nobody has seen his third form, and he wholeheartedly believes nobody is stronger than, so it's clear he's never been tested up until he fights the saiyans. If Frieza trained even slightly, SSJ Shallot should have been no problem for him."

"I want her exalted weapon to drain off of health, and not energy. That would be pretty unique and go with her theme. She can restore her own health, so it can be a risk vs. reward thing, where the lower you let your health run down, the more damage the claws do. They can even have an additional multiplier on top of her passive."
"Writing fanfic is what just got me an offer to do creative writing for money.

I don't rely on fanfic reviews for constructive feedback, though I put the same sort of structure and effort into planning my fanfics. I put in the work and keep getting myself feedback from trusted friends and fellow writers that I know understand what I'm going for but are also brutally honest. When all of that is finished and I publish a piece, I enjoy the positive comments from readers for what they are and get back to work.

Ultimately what you get out of it depends on what you put into it. I have written mindless cute fluff, but also more ambitious works, and according to the company representative that contacted me they did it because they could tell from my writing that I can handle overarching themes, character development, pacing, prose etc. I'm not saying that fanfic is the best way to get ""proper"" writing jobs, but I wouldn't knock it as a great playground to practice many of the important elements of a narrative."
