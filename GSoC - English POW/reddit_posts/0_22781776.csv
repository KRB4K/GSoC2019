"Hey that's great, I mean it. 

In the other progress pic comment section there was a Redditor who talked about posting his own progress pic six months ago and mentioned he'd already put it back on and was dieting again.

I'm not saying this to be an asshole, but the reality is that the vast majority of people who get healthy end up putting the weight back on. Do some research and find out what a healthy relationship with food looks like (if you haven't already). 

As good as you feel now (and you've earned it), you'll feel equally as depressed if you wind up taking another ride on the rolly-polly-coaster. 

Find some healthy recipes, pick up an active hobby, maybe grow your own veggie garden and you'll find out junk food doesn't actually taste all that good. And give yourself a break once in a while, you're doing alright."

So I can’t lie I’ve never actually measured myself (I don’t get to work with any live pangolins) but they can stick out their tongue about 10 inches according to the internet.

I first learn about it a couple years ago when I lived in Hong Kong and was member of Hong Kong police force. My son had new friend who was studying for semester who was from US. I google his name on work computer and the site called canary has link with his name on it. 

For some reason site was blocked at work and I found strange because as member of police they don’t block much on work computer. I use phone to look at it and the information about my sons friend seemed very bad and they paint him as extremest. I met the young man and talk with him and I wonder if this site is a trusted source. 

I’m sorry if I help feed the negative first comments but I have real question. "

Ended up moving back to that state a year later (almost to the date) and my whole family was incredibly impressed. It's really a great feeling to know that my effort had results but nothing feels better than not having man boobs or a big gut."

"I think Halloween 4 gets easily dismissed because it is fourth in a franchise, and the general opinion is that any franchise gets worse with each consecutive sequel. 

On it's own though, Halloween 4 is excellent. The performances were solid, to the point where you actually care what happens to the characters (essential to effective horror). I also enjoyed how brisk and straightforward the film was. No overly-contrived setups or distracting set pieces or plot elements. Kept things grounded and muted to give it that quasi-realism that made the original Halloween so scary."

"You have struck at something which is a bit interesting about the American right, which I was just thinking about earlier.

The American conservative movement is composed of many different factions, that often disagree with each other. If you pay attention to the different members of the GOP, it is fairly obvious.

All parts share a shared goal of reducing government spending, and changing policies to encourage economic growth through deregulation. On social issues, foreign policy, and use of the military, there are many contested points.

The big one that most people like to bring up is the Religious Right. This group wishes to use the power of government to legislate morality. These people support bans on gay marriage and abortion, and are opposed to the legalization of drugs. This group is becoming less prominent, being replaced by....

The Constitutional Conservative, which is a name I just made up because it fits, are people who believe that the roll of the federal government should be reduced in all aspects, and efforts to legislate morality are both in vain, and beyond the scope of the federal government. These people generally support the right of the States to make decisions. Generally, these people support gay marriage, and do not support the federal ban on marijuana. Both for the same reason - it is not the job of the federal government to regulate such things. Thoughts on abortion tend to be mixed in this group, depending on how each person answers the moral questions of killing a fetus, and how that fits into the powers of the government.

The next group is the Neocons, who are most noted for being the most militaristic. These people support the use and maintenance of a strong global military presence to further American interests. This is also generally coupled with a softer approach to spending and welfare cuts, and often try to appeal to more moderate Democrats in elections. 

The next big faction, and the newest, is the populists. Trump is the poster child for this. This group is very much focused on the wants and needs of the common working man, and other issues become secondary. Illegal immigration, trade negotiations, tax cuts, and regulation reduction are all primary focuses of this group, while more social concerns are often secondary. Things like gay marriage and abortion are not priories, one way or the other, so positions from individuals in this group will be mixed. Also, there is a very pro-military, but anti-war sentiment here - which focuses on deterrence through strength and training, rather than the Neocon interventionism. 

The last major group I can think of right now are the Libertarians. Still not strong enough to stand on their own, many are a part of the GOP, or vote for GOP candidates. Their views are pretty simple: government has a military, enforces basic laws against things like murder and theft, and that's it. Legalize all recreational drugs, all guns, ditch as much regulation as possible, get the government out in every possible way. There are varying degrees of Libertarian, all the way to anarchists, who do not tend to vote Republican, but are still part of the right.

TL;DR: The American right is very diverse, and holds many conflicting views."

"So I'm certainly biased towards Kavanaugh on this one, but I'll try to be as neutral as possible.

President Trump nominated a new Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. When he was supposed to be confirmed, 4 women came forward, and accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when he was younger. 3 of them have been determined to be false due to the accounts being extremely inconsistent, but one of the women, Dr. Christine Ford, has been taken seriously because she has been fairly consistent with her story. The only inconsistency that's really been made is the number of people who were at the scene of it, and even then she's provided a pretty good reason for it.

Something that adds more validity to the story is the fact that this has been discussed with (iirc) the democrats (or a government entity, I just know that this isn't the first time Ford has mentioned it) before he was nominated. Along with the fact that we know that Ford had some sort of trauma, as seen by her friends, colleagues, and therapist.


Now here's where we get into my opinion. At this point, it really doesn't matter, and I don't think that it can really be used against Kavanaugh, even though I don't even want him to be a Justice for 4th amendment issues. If it were more recent, and had the ability to be investigated in a way that could be accurate, then I'd say it should be a factor, but at this point it's all hearsay evidence, and he said she said statements.

Edit: added a line"

"Last company I worked for had a similar problem. I was on the IT team and we would take week-long shifts being on-call for any tech support issues for remote workers. There was a separate infrastructure team with their own on-call personnel who would deal with things like site outages for offices.

The nice thing was that before an end user could reach us they went through another separate team that operated 24/7 who would forward calls to the right people.

Most of the time any issue at any hour would be forwarded to the IT support team. We'd get forwarded calls about HR issues, power outages, directions for traveling, etc.

If we couldn't help them they would contact people very high up to have shit rained down on us.

The only person who saw any problem with it was our team and our immediate supervisor who would get in yelling matches with the higher UPS and basically risk his job to protect his team. He was cool, but I didn't see the situation improving and I'm sure everyone will have left that company in a year or two. I myself saw the issues with the company early, and left after only 6 months.

**Julie:** I want to explore the area first. Something doesn't seem right.

**John:** Yeah, I kinda want to look around, too.

**DM:** Roll me an investigation check!

**Julie:** Crap. Eight.

**John:** Ha! Nat 20!

**DM:** Okay, so, you check out the surrounding area and you suddenly hear a rustling in a nearby bush.

**John:** Can I pee on the bush?

**Brett:** Please don't do that. There might be berries or something on it we can eat.

**DM:** There are not any berries. *But* you look around the bushes and you find a band of pixies.

**John:** The *fuck?!*

**Julie:** I wanna talk to them.

**Dana:** Yeah, they might know where to find this cavern we're searching for since *SOMEONE* used our map as toilet paper!

**Matt:** What? I had the shits, okay?

**Dana:** Yeah, from drinking all that Orc mead!

**Matt:** Still better than this shitty beer. [*crushes can and reaches for another Natty Ice*]

**Julie:** I'm talking to the pixies. What languages do they know?

**DM:** They know the common tongue.

**Julie:** Okay, so hey there, little pixies? What's up?

**DM:** [*in high-pitched voice*] Hi! Sorry, we hope we didn't disturb you! We're just hanging out, that's all. Don't let us bother you.

**Matt:** They're hiding something. I can smell it.

**John:** All I can smell is that nasty beer you're drinking.

**Matt:** Shut up. I wanna interrogate these pixies. [*rolls*] Boom! Eighteen, motherfucker.

**DM:** [*sighs*] All right, so Sloppy the Dwarf, you go up to the pixies and you start to interrogate them. As you do, you notice one of them is wearing armour just like yours. He's got a tiny axe and he's even drinking really shitty beer like yours.

**Matt:** Hey. Eat a dick.

**John:** I think he already did. His breath smells like balls.

**DM:** And how would you know what balls smell like?

**John:** Well, after we made out last week...

**Julie:** Okay, enough! I'm gonna ask the pixies if they wanna join us around the fire, maybe share some of the fish we caught.

**DM:** [*in high-pitched voice*] Omigod, we'd LOVE TO! We're your biggest fans!

**Dana:** Wait, wait, hold up. Fans? What?

**DM:** You heard...erm, Fingelsnark. Yeah. He said he's your biggest fan and you see that his girlfriend, Tinytits, is scribbling away furiously on a piece of parchment. In fact, several of them are carrying pieces of parchment or notebooks, plus ink and quills. A few of them are wearing armour and carrying weapons that are tiny versions of yours.

**John:** Hey, erm, whatcha...whatcha writing there, little fella?

**DM:** [*higher-pitched voice*] Fuck you, I'm a girl!

**John:** Fuck you, I'm a non-binary demisexual elf fighter.

**DM:** [*same higher-pitched voice*] Not according to my headcanon, you're not!

**Brett:** What? Are they writing fan-fiction about us?

**DM:** [*normal voice*] Ask the pixies.

**Brett:** Are you writing fan-fiction about us?

**DM:** [*higher-pitched voice*] Erm...no...

**Matt:** I'm stealing one of their books and reading it.

**DM:** [*normal voice*] You snatch away a tiny book that Crinkleballs is writing in and you begin to read it.

**Matt:** I'm sorry, what? What's his name?

**DM:** You try coming up with all these names! You weren't even supposed to know they were following you until you got to the cavern. Anyway, you open the book and you start to read it aloud. They have been following you for months and every night they *have been writing fan-fiction* about *ALL. OF. YOU.* And apparently they've decided that Sloppy the Dwarf and Twoflower the Elf are OTP.

**Brett:** Oh my god. No. NO!

**Julie and Dana:** BWAHAHAHAHA!

**Matt:** Well, shit. [*looks at John*] Yeah, okay, I'd totally do him.

**John:** [*shrugs in Gay*] I'm down. Let's make fan-fact.

**Dana:** Okay, no, not in front of us!

**John:** Then y'all go back to camp and me and Sloppy will perform for the pixies. [*touches Matt's cheek lovingly*] Whaddya say? Sloppy firsts?

**Matt:** [*laughs*] Yeah, all right. Should we roll a stamina check or acrobatics?

**DM:** You know what? Do both. I kinda want to see what happens.

**Julie:** I'm going to bed. Correction, Moon's going to bed.

**Brett:** I get out my camcorder so I can sell the video on DnDporn.com.

**John:** I make one of the pixies transcribe it so we can put it on r/SuddenlyGay later.

**DM:** God damn it, Matt! You're not even gay!

**Matt:** Hey! Sloppy can do whatever he wants. And right now he's doing Twoflower.

**John:** We are now bromosexuals.

**Brett:** And they say bromance is dead...

"I feel the exact same way. I just bought a PS4 to play Spiderman, and TLOU was on sale, and people are always raving about it, so I picked it up. $10, how can you go wrong? 

Gameplay is fine. You just sneak around and stealth-kill zombies and people. 
But I found that the only reason I find myself playing more is to progress through the story, and not to enjoy the game mechanics. For me, Spiderman nails both game mechanics and story, but that's subjective.

So the story, I'm guessing, is the reason why people love this game. But to me, it just feels so similar to all of the other zombie shows and movies that have been around for so long, that its just not that interesting to me. I'm never in a rush to get home after work to play TLOU. At this point, I'm playing just so I don't waste my $10. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game. But I think I'd rather just watch a movie about TLOU than play through it lol. "

Enjoy all the things you enjoy doing as ""you"", and that includes sharing with our loved ones, as they probably will never look or present themselves to us the same way they are now. Maybe in another lifetimes we won't have the same affinity we have in this one. So yeah basically, in our temporal selves, we will forget each other once we are living a different life. However, the soul remembers. If you develop your spiritual abilities enough, you always can access to the memories of previous lifetimes, and relive the bonds with our most beloved souls. 

Even if that's a possibility, the goal has always been live our current lifes to the fullest. I think the best way it's to live from the perspective that nothing is ever lost, even if it looks like it. Our soul will always treasure its memories and the bonds that we experienced in these time-space realities, and love will always remain."

"Here we are, some more photos from RoboNerd. 

To summarise RoboNerd it was a small event arranged by Simon Harrison of King Buxton game, mainly as an event for people to be able to bring and display their robots, other projects such as monowheels or small bits of tech for fun like Ian Watts RC traffic cones. It was held outside a small pub so you could order some food and drinks while chatting to people at the event.

There was both a Beetle arena and an Ant arena to hold small completions throughout the day.
Any parts broken off during combat would be attached to the event trophy with permission from the builder with a community vote for who deserved the trophy at the end. In the end the trophy was given to Simon himself for organising such a great event. 

It was all around a great experience I would totally recommend it to any UK Battlebots/Robot Wars fans if you’re in the area.

Photo credit for a couple of these go to Simon himself, because my photos of Spectre and Limpet were terrible!

"Identical? No, what I expect is a small variance much like that between difference races, where there is far more overlap than there is distinction. To illustrate, look at the third venn diagram in [this image](http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/AAAconceptions.jpg). Of course, there is no larger orange 'African' circle, because both sexes left Africa.

If we were to eventually pin down exactly how the behavior of the sexes varies naturally, I think we would find there would be a negligible difference, where e.g. men are *slightly* more likely to exhibit trait X than Y, but overall there are nearly as many women with trait X. Essentially, those differences will be more 'the exception' than 'the rule,' and there is often more variance between individuals within a single sex than between those of different sexes.

Given that every trait that could be 'typical' of one sex can be helpful to any human, and especially considering how plasticity in the human brain allows reinforcement of a behavior to become a part of a person's psyche, no behavior should be seen as 'innate' to one sex or another. Just like we don't consider any behavior to be 'innately' Asian or European, even if it happens to be more prominent on average in one than the other. 

More importantly, since science (again, to my knowledge) cannot currently assign any single behavior to sex rather than culture, and because external influences like encouragement or discouragement have already been proven to have an impact on one's choices, in any given instance the argument that 'maybe it's innate' is a lazy one."

Since you're stuck with the game anyway, give it a few more runs. The magic really happens when you get a great combination of items. If you're anything like me, you'll have a run with awesome, synergistic powers, then decide you *have* to go again to see what happens next time.  :) "

I know you said you don't want documentaries, but if you think you aren't bothered by it, you should watch [Earthlings](http://www.nationearth.com/). It is full of undercover footage of what actually happens in slaughterhouses.

&gt;Society agrees that keeping livestock is fine, I'm not sure what you're getting at here.

Society agrees that causing unnecessary harm is wrong. Animal agriculture in the modern world is nothing but unnecessary harm.

&gt;No, because I see dogs as companions. Just beating animals for the hell of it is fucked up, as are the factory farming environments.

But you said that might makes right, so which is it? You can't have random exceptions to your moral code without some sort of doublethink.

&gt;Benevolent. But what you're doing right here is a false equivalence anyways.

How is it a false equivalence? Cows and pigs and sheep and goats and chickens can all understand their environment and feel pain and fear just like we can. 

&gt;Are... Are you actually trying to argue that cows aren't a lower life form than humans? Because they most definitely are.

By what definition?

&gt;Humans don't have owners, what are you trying to say here?

Maybe I interpreted what you said wrong. I assumed ""owners"" could be applied similarly to any other peer. "

Also story is pretty interesting in the later chapters and events. The majority of characters can be farmed.

As for dragalia lost it's hard to tell where things will go from here. the game is still brand new. I havent rolled at all in this game aside from my initial starting 2. I'm extremely wary of the possibility (basically inevitable) of powercreep. Because they'll need to add something drastically new to the game every now and then so we dont lose interest. 

As it is now gameplay wise each character is just X attribute + X weapon style. Leaving only skills and some stats/passives left to make characters really feel unique gameplay wise. So it'll take until the next major update to really get an idea of what their designs will be like for the future.

"Cant agree more.  I have 48 disks spinning and I could knock it down to 24 if I upgraded 12 to 8TB and the savings in electricity would pretty much make the drives free over the years they will last.

Started with a 12x500GB array around 2007/2008.  Eventually upgraded to 12x2TB drives.  Now I have 12x8TB drives.  Problem is the 12x2TB drives still work fine so I just added a second array - and half of the 10yr old 500GB drives still work too so I have them in a JBOD case for torrents to see how long they last - friend gave me a bunch of random 1-2TB drives from SSD upgrades on oem systems I also have in the JBOD.  Plus I have 6 4TB drives I purchased when I was going to do a 12x4 array before I discovered the 8tb easystores.  Probably should have just sold the 2&amp;4TB drives while they were still worth something.  Might still be worth selling and reinvesting in 8tb drives.

10w x 24/7 is $11.5 a year where I live.  So ~6 years is $70 in electricity. So if 4TB drives cost $45, but a 8TB drive costs $160 seems like 4TB is way cheaper per GB but when you add in the electricity for 6 years the price is the same + half the bays and less waste(poor planet).

Or if you do the above with 2TB drives.  4x 2TB drives that are FREE cost more then a $160 8TB after less then 5 years.  Yep in the long run $160 8TB drives are cheaper then FREE 2tb drives."

"Last time I tried X-scape it worked okay but the sound was extremely stuttery. Also, if I remember correctly DSiWare requires a bit of setup: I think just changing CPU speed and memory in settings to match DSi? Not so sure on the details since it's been a while."
"I looked at your site, I think it's pretty quick actually.

Maybe you are testing it incorrectly?  

There are other plugins that will tell you what plugins may be running slow.  Also yes, cloudflare is free so use that.

Also it may be measuring it from a unloaded state.  If your site isn't used for a period of time it kind of goes to sleep for the first load.  You can usually solve this by implementing a monitoring tool that pings your site every 15 minutes or so.

If I were you, I'd do everything above.  I'd also set up a new site on that host or disable all your plugins for a minute and test.  If it's still slow you know you won't be able to do anything further on your side.  If it's fast, you can figure out what plugins are slowing things down."

"&gt; where I feel people (locals) make a point to not stare. 

People in US (outside NYC) have a warped idea of what a stare means.

A stare means intensely observing someone with focussed attention to the point of making them uncomfortable.

In US, especially small towns, a simply ""resting face"" is interpreted as a stare. Unless you have a smile plastered on your face like Joker or keep head nodding at everyone , people think you are staring at them.

Which is why people in US think Germans and Russians ""stare"" at people. They don't. That is simply the normal expressionless face, since there is no obligation to smile or head-nod at every stranger the street."
Same analogy as learning language from a native vs a non-native person

&gt; Jesus said to become like little children, because such was the kingdom of God. IE children have no sin.

So when Jesus said ""Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it” you took that to mean ""You do not have a sinful nature"", and not, as most scholars agree, that we are to be humble, teachable, open, and innocent as we accept his sacrifice and teachings?"

The white paper reads, “In the future, if any methods be used to create the private key of this address – the BCH protocol might prohibit coins in this address from being transferred.”

&gt; This shows that the developers are not thinking decentralization—the heart of cryptocurrency—and are fully prepared to wield their power over the network. They have also coded Wormhole to allow them to assert their control on a whim.

&gt; Elsewhere in the white paper, Wormhole developers make the claim that Wormhole can provide greater decentralization and independent outputs. However, given the fact that they have coded Wormhole to be able to control the network, where exactly is the decentralization?"

"Vanilla feeling of reaching Stranglethorn Vale, and leveling within it. It seemed so huge and adventurous, much more densely packed than the zones I leveled in so far, with a new quest or a dangerous group of enemies around every corner. Everyone was leveling back then, so zones with a wide level range and a huge number of quests like Stranglethorn ended up being a mini-Barrens, which I didn't experience because I was playing Alliance, so it felt very social and immersive on that front too.

Of course the best days were when the first honor system hit right as I was still questing in the zone... I remember the main road being literally littered with corpses, from Booty Bay to Nesingwary's. I absolutely enjoyed the madness, even if for a few days I got very little leveling done..."

Body mass index (BMI), expressed as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2), is commonly used to classify overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9), obesity (BMI at or above 30.0), and severe obesity (BMI at or above 40.0).”"

"It is a premise of *your* argument. That does not make what I said a non sequitur, especially since much of what I said was in response to other issues, and you have not addressed those issues. 

If you want to claim that if God doesn't exist, reason is not justified, that makes your argument valid, but at the cost now not being the least bit sound. You now have to support your claim of Premise 2 ... and from what I have seen how presuppositionalists argue, that is done by denying the consequent from Premise 1. Now, if you want to argue that I'm lying, and I've never seen presuppositionalists make an argument along those lines, then perhaps we should get the moderators involved. Otherwise, I think you owe me an apology for calling my post a ""non-sequitur"".

Your argument only needs premise one and three; premise two and conclusion one are superfluous. It's a bit odd to include superfluous premises in your argument, and then claim it's a ""non-sequitur"" when someone points out that relying on those premises would be a fallacy. If there's a non sequitur, it's including Premise 1 in the first place, if you don't plan on relying on it."

"Bom, esse é um jeito de definir a esquerda e a direita... Mas se você colocar a esquerda como oposição ao status quo, todo regime autoritário - que é definido por perseguir sua oposição - vai ser anti-esquerda.

Mas essa definição é mais útil numa discussão histórica do que política. 

O Liberalismo pode ser esquerda dependendo do contexto histórico, por exemplo. Afinal, foi um dos motores ideológicos de muitas revoluções no ocidente, com seu maior exemplo na França. 

Não acho prático definir esquerda dessa maneira, no contexto político atual. Dá a entender que ideologias que hoje estão colocadas à direita são alheias à repressão ou quebra de paradigmas.

"Limestone is largely made up of Calcium Carbonate, which is frequently used by aquarists to raise PH and General hardness. It is created from billions of shells and coral from ancient seabeds which has been compressed over millions or billions of years. 

It is also what most of the water in Minnesota is running through all the time (source: grew up there and also my dad worked at the water plant and told me). 

What will make the water cloudy is if there’s a lot of silt and silica in the batch you get - but this is basically the same as with any ol’ substrate and you mostly will need to rinse it before use. 

If it’s just limestone and not like... painted in some way (limestone is TERRIBLE for painting. You want marble for that...) it should actually be fine. Just make sure it’s not stored next to pesticides or something. And really rinse it before use. 

Edit: those marble stones will also raise your PH and hardness. It is exactly what limestone is but with more pressure added. "

"Are you familiar with the theory of parallel universes? It’s theorised that sometimes different universes with almost exactly the same characteristics can sometimes overlap each other. It’s put forward as a possible reason for a phenomena known as the Mandela effect, named for the experiences of some people who believed that Nelson Mandela died in prison - they even claim that they saw the story on television ( indeed I have actually experienced instances of this myself in the past - hearing of someone’s passing when I was convinced I’d read about it years before. It’s quite disconcerting).
The theory is that sometimes people can actually cross from one universe to another. There are no major differences and everything appears the same on the surface, but there may be one little thing that sets it apart from the other in the experience of the person affected. In fact it can happen so often that it goes pretty much undetected apart from perhaps a niggling feeling that something is wrong. The feeling known as Deja-Vu is attributed to this also. 

Perhaps you experienced something similar that night. It would be interesting to investigate more,

"I’ve looked into this recently. It’s kinda sorta true...

Here’s some perspective:

Watergate alone counts for 69 of the 120 indictments. 

Every president except Jimmy Carter had at least one official in the executive branch charged with crimes. Here’s the breakdown.

Trump : 1 (so far)
Obama: 1
Bush: 9 
Clinton: 4
Bush: 1
Reagan: 5
Carter: 0
Ford: 1 
Nixon: 10

During every administration since Nixon several members of Congress have been charged with crimes. Most are tax evasion, tax fraud, mail fraud, or misuse of campaign funds. Who got indicted?

Democrats: 36
Republicans: 23

There did not appear to be a pattern of either party indicting the other more or less frequently when in the majority. 

Hope this puts it in perspective !

EDIT: Changed “indicted” to “charged.” Sorry for any confusion. "

When a scholarship reduction is removed, the damage is felt for years. You still can't exceed 25 in a year and you obviously can't retroactively add players to a class, so you won't have a roster of full scholarship level players until 2 or 3 years after the reduction happened.

"It's not illegal in California. The problem is parents getting accounts for their children. They are putting their own children at risk It is against the Lyft TOS for them to have an account.

Age requirement

Unaccompanied minors are prohibited from traveling with most carriers, including TNCs. A passenger must be 18 to sign up for a Lyft account, but if a driver believes a passenger might be underage, the driver may ask the passenger to confirm their age.


The driver may also let a passenger know that the driver will have to cancel the trip if the passenger is indeed under 18. In addition, drivers can report requests to transport unaccompanied minors by tapping 'Contact Support' below.


0000000000


Bottom line is, you as a driver need to protect yourself. Don't give a ride to someone you suspect is in minor. Having a dash cam is also a good idea.  For all reasons. It's up to the parents to protect their children by not putting them in a car with a stranger that hasn't had a more rigorous background check.

"What a horse shit generalized comment. You make it sound like thousands of Korean women just drunkenly fall to their knees for American soldier penis. While there is certainly prostitution near the base - and most of that “goes on” is the result of prostitution - it is mostly frowned upon in modern Korean society for women to engage with soldiers in any way.

Good job spreading the “Asian women are sluts” message though, shocked you are upvoted for such crap."

I've lived in rural and semi-rural towns where open carry was very common. These were regular 9 to 5 people and carrying was simply just part of their routine. No one freaked out and got all emotional about it, like you, and they didn't insult people that chose differently, unlike you. It really was never a big deal. Those that carry lawfully are overwhelmingly not the ones harming others. Sorry you can't wrap your head around that. "

Are you colourblind? 
"I think it was added in the Royal Pack dlc. There are monument for some of the kings (mainly the ones you fight as part of the updated final boss rush) in Insomnia that you can check out which give you a rundown on them. The Rogue Queen's monument tells us about her story and how she lead her kingdom from the shadows after her brother and father were killed.

As for what happened to the magic, idk. The game doesn't really go into full detail about what goes on after Noctis is gone. The bloodline's magic is tied to the crystal with the ring just being a sort of amplifier and a communication device for the past kings' souls. So if the Crystal is still around there should still be some sort of magic in the world or at least it should be possible to bring it back somehow but for now we really don't know. Honestly it's not even made clear if the bloodline can only use its magic with the crystal still being around or if its something just inherently embedded in their DNA now that can be utilized even after the crystal is gone because Ardyn still possesses the bloodline's magic despite being rejected by the crystal. 

So it begs the question of does the family constantly draw upon the crystal or is it just a one time thing where they were granted the power and it became an inherent part of their biology? If the latter is the case then I'm certain some distant relative of the bloodline would certainly still possess the family's magic. We'll never really know anything beyond the fact that the core bloodline is done and over with."

"I still have to disagree. The PS5 is still a ways out, we talk about it at work quite often. If the dancing games do well, they could still bring 3 and 4 over  especially since 5 has gotten as big as it has.

Alternatively they could also do a ""Persona Collection"" for PS5 (though this is definitely wishful thinking and not something they'd probably do)"
"Schwartz plays DB’s way off to ensure we don’t get burned by big plays and then it gives the D-Line time to hit the QB because WR’s have to run 8 yards to even get near a DB so they can’t fuck o up right?

Wrong, this is absolutely backfiring on us at this point. You can hide poor secondary play when you have a great D-Line and play 10 yards off.

"Similar situation for me. My fiancé is big into Tamagotchis and so I went out and looked at my two local stores expecting to strike out. The first store didn't receive their shipment but directed me to the other one since it showed Low Stock for that location. Sure enough, I went in and asked the associate about them. He was under the impression that the shelf date was tomorrow (10/1) but when he checked the computer and saw it was today he gladly went to the back and brought out a large shipping box loaded with them. My girl loves the Galaxy and Mermaid colored ones and I managed to get the only Galaxy version. Unfortunately there were no Mermaid-colored ones so I took a guess and got her another one that is white with green Japanese writing on it. I'm going to surprise her with them tonight!

"I agree with you.

- Spring (my least favorite), it's very humid and in my parents opinon it wouldn't be cold enough to run the heat or hot enough to run the A/C and they would have the windows opened and it would feel awful. If I have to put up with another spring like that, I'm probably going to buy a window unit A/C for my room (I'm still currently living with my parents).

It rains very frequently which is annyoing.

Flowers are nice but I prefer leaves.

I also don't care about any Spring holidays.

- Summer, (better than Winter) horribly hot and humid but everybody pretty much has the A/C on so being inside generally feels nice (unless a place has an unpowered A/C), I usually have more free time during the summer, the summer has a lot of daylight, there's pools and vacations, The 4th of July is a decent holiday in my opinon to.

- Fall, (My favorite) an excellent time of year, after the first few weeks of fall, it's usually a nice temperature and not too humid and the leaves are nice colors, it usually doesn't rain too much and I like Halloween and Thanksgiving.

- Winter, (better than Spring but not as good as Summer) where I live it rarely snows in my area so I can't really do anything snow related but just the fact that it's cold and usually has low humidy is nice. I'm not really crazy about Christmas (mostly due to over exposure, seriously I see Christmas stuff in October a lot) but Christmas break is really nice and I like New Years Eve.  "

"Finally made it back from the show. God Sunday service is a nightmare at times.  Show was way longer than necessary, rescued at the end by an excellent main event.

Agree with people that the randomly assigned seats were a major detriment, not being able to snag an aisle seat at 6'6"" is a nightmare, especially with the show running five hours +.

**Riddle/Haskins** was a good solid match, but should have been shorter in the scheme of things, could have pinched some time here given the crowded schedule but what they served up was nice.

**Ladies three-way** was a messy rush to do a lot of things in a very short amount of time (Outside interference, heel turn and post fight intervention).  Given the talent in the match, I think it was given nowhere near enough time to let the participants tell the story they were intending to.  Think this was probably shrunk to fit in more time for other matches when in reality they should have had less matches, and let this one develop a bit more.

**Atlas** did everything it set out to.  No real complaints.

**Havoc/Robinson** again was as expected, spot fest that had the crowd into it.

**Thunderbastard** was entertaining but dragged a little in the end.  Gibson continues to be the biggest heat magnet in Progress.

**Dunne vs Ilja**, zero heat to this match at the start, about the time four hours in everyone was starting to clock watch.  They eventually dragged the crowd into the match but spent a load of time and effort to get it to that stage.  Could have quite happily seen this match cut from the show and wouldn't have felt like I missed anything despite the quality of the performance.

**TLC grudge match**, awful match made worse by the shoddy equipment.  Unbesiegbar brand tables proving both a complete failure, and conversely the only thing that got the crowd into the match.  Horrible way to end one of the better storylines Progress has had this year.

**Progress Title** was at the end of a long show a real standout.  Bate and Walter are both stars, and they told a great story within this match.  By far the best match of the night."

"My best friend was shot in the head nearly five years ago and there still hasn’t been a trial. The people are in jail without bail and have been since but it has literally been FIVE YEARS and there hasn’t been a single trial of any kind. This is in the state of Alabama. 

Also, same state, I was raped and almost murdered in August of last year and I did everything right but they never even did anything with my rape kit. I called the police to the scene. I went to the hospital then to the rape center where they performed a rape kit and were able to get DNA. Yet nothing was ever done. My detective ignores my calls and never calls me back. The city never did a thing with the rape kit. I don’t know the assailant as it was a random attack but the city never ran the DNA. I’m not sure where to go from here.

I guess for her its not so much the act of smoking, as it is me actively trying to keep it from her and hide it from her. We have a very open relationship and she feels like I was hiding a big part of my life from her."

"what’s wrong with teachers and bullying? Someone bullies someone, if they tell the teacher, the only reply they get is “ignore and they’ll leave you”. So they ignore, get hurt and continue on their life which may or may not end up in either therapy or suicide. But the bullies though, what did they learn? They learned that no one will tell them anything and whatever they’re doing is fine and normal and the teachers won’t bother them and they won’t get in trouble. So they go to higher classes and the whole cycle continues. 

It’s like a rape victim comes to you and says she got raped, but then you tell her to just “ignore the pain, act like it doesn’t bother you and maybe they’ll leave you alone”.
Even if she does that, the message sent is don’t trust authorities. And you can rape or bully whoever you want and you’re invincible. 

Then the teachers bother you saying “why’re you being racist to them” when you do decide to take a stand against them and the story suddenly changes to “it’s all your fault, you must have done something for them to provoke you.”  "

"There's brutal tons of competence as to what's the best and cheapest HG kit.

Here's a list of perfect beginner kits in terms of being some of the best around but also painfully dirt cheap:

* Leo/Leo NPD
* RX-78-2 Revive
* AGE-1 Normal
* Hi-Mock (probably the cheapest on the shared ratio)
* GM/GM
* Almost every HG kit from the IBO line
* Gundam 00 Diver

Tbh, in the end, the ideal HG for a person simply is the one which design tingles your tastes the most.

__________

About RGs, absolutely none of them are cheap. The best ones ever are the Gundam Mk. II (doesn't matter which color), Tallgeese, any Unicorn variant, and among all the Sazabi (but I warn this latter one isn't precisely the cheapest thing ever, but sure is worth what it costs.

"I'm a woman, but I've been in your shoes before, although in my case we did try dating for a short period of time and he didn't want to continue it. I had to completely distance myself from my best friend for a few months in order to work through my feelings. He was respectful and gave me my time and space, and I did end up picking our friendship back up. I'll admit even after the space, it was still a bit hard for the first few girls he dated. But over time, I can now be supportive and happy for him when he starts dating someone new and vica versa. 

That being said, it was a hard road to go down and it took YEARS for everything to fully fade. You should ask yourself if your friendship is worth it to you to work through these feelings- really decide if you want this closeness with her when she will never reciprocate your romantic feelings. I say this because I spent a long time in a hopeful place that he would someday come to his senses and that ruined my dating life for a long time.

TL;DR Yes it can be done, but will require you distancing yourself from her for sometime. It will be really difficult even with that, so make sure you know you actually want to be her platonic friend "

The family disliked him when they were together, and they had broken up. He was an ex boyfriend that the family didn't like, it's no wonder he didn't offer them condolences.

"Home opener is always a good atmosphere; Games where something monumental happens (a record, a hat trick, a really sick goal, McDavid hits 100 points, etc); and playoff games are next level. I really recommend trying to attend a playoff game if you ever get the chance. A preseason game is never going to be as hopping. People can pick up those last minute tickets for $20, and they don't feel bad about not paying attention, not staying til the end, or getting as into it (drinking, chanting, etc)... the game is meaningless in regards to our playoff hopes.

Personally, I love preseason games - Less busy concourse, check out our future NHLers who haven't made the team yet, cheaper tickets, guys battling to make the team, and the home team usually wins because the roster disparity is slanted towards the home team most of the time. But if I were to only spend $300 on Oilers tickets in a year, I would rather go to 1 playoff game in the nosebleeds than a half dozen regular season games, or a couple in the gold section. They just need to make playoffs for that to be possible."

"Hey, I'm a rank 66 player trying to prep for the upcoming GW. I'm almost done with creating a cookie-cutter fire grid and I'm wondering what the best bahamut weapon for my team should be. My fire team consists of Metera(Fire), Ageilba, and SSR Aliza.

I've still yet to pick a bahamut weapon from the WMTSB side story and I've heard that the dagger is a good choice for humans and erunes. I know that draphs benefit greatly from swords, but Metera seems to do the most damage on average. However, I doubt I'll be able to get the coda upgrade anytime soon If I were to pick the dagger.

Any suggestions?"

"Unfortunately there's a culture surrounding how men and women are supposed to interact - everything is sexualized, even between siblings or family members. I personally think it's great you're supportive of your sister's interests and have a kind relationship with her, it's a rarity to see among siblings and a shame your girlfriend cannot see it as such.

You could handle this a few different ways depending on how you'd like to proceed. If you're interested in trying to work things out, I would sit down with her in person and discuss her insecurities that are leading to her jealousy. Explain to her that family is important to you, and that you have no sexual or romantic feelings toward your sister (ew!) and that you love her, but you're having a hard time empathizing with her because of her hostility and refusal to open up about what's bothering her. Go from there.

If you're feeling worn out and done, I'd end it and wish her well. She's clearly got issues if she doesn't like that you're trying to be a good brother to your younger sister."

"It’s not fair to place expectations on Apple to build another product like the iPhone. No product has ever been so successful, and there is no guarantee that even Steve Jobs himself could build anything else close to it within this timeframe.

The iPhone wasn’t created in a vacuum— it was built off a confluence of emerging tech like multitouch. We may not be in a place technologically for another comparable revolution for a while. AR and self driving cars look like promising opportunities though, and Apple is in a prime place to take advantage."

"Organic produce doesn't keep as well. There's nothing wrong with artificial selection of crops, it's just that the selective pressures we are generally exerting have changed. We don't simply select for the taste of a product, but for it's portability, longevity, mass, or appearance because that's what supermarkets can sell.

Before GM foods, we still applied evolutionary pressure to crops. Even organic or heirloom vegetables are artificial and the result of unnatural human tampering (over hundreds of years). Corn is far different today from how it appeared naturally before humans, for example."

"Your question is bizarre, because lots of people can fill lots of different roles. A mason could technically become a carpenter, that doesn't mean carpenters don't provide value.

But as for what capitalists do, they provide value by filling (at least) the following three roles in society, all of which are necessary for productivity:

1. Intelligent allocation of resources. Somebody has to decide where resources are spent.

2. Assumption of risk. Information being imperfect means we can never know if an activity is valuable until after the fact. Somebody is going to lose out when resources are misallocated. The capitalist assumes that risk. If an investment fails, the workers got paid even though a profitable product was never created.

3. Deferral of payment. Even if you had resources intelligently allocated and there were no risk, the workers have to survive until their products reach the market. The capitalist defers payment in exchange for profits later.

"&gt;Europeans didn’t bathe themselves. This is generally regarded as the blame for the epidemic. That’s why the plague took off in Europe, where as it didn’t devastate Asia.

That's wrong though, as of 1200, China had a total population of more than 120 million, but a 1393 census found only 65 million Chinese surviving. Some of that missing population was killed by famine and upheaval in the transition from Yuan to Ming rule, but many millions died of bubonic plague.

&gt;We’re not talking about the plague spreading in Europe. You can whatabout all you want though.

Except it's a direct comparison, saying whataboutism is a nice way to dodge the point these days though.

"I think Dorion will be a highly debated GM for years.

On one hand, he will forever be the GM who traded Erik Karlsson and completely destroyed the Ottawa Senators. He ruined Bryan Murray's legacy and might as well go to his house and punch his children in the face while he's at it.

On the other hand, he was an excellent scout and has pulled off some incredible draft selections. We also will never fully be able to evaluate his trades because of how involved Melnyk has been (call it meddling if you want, I think it's fair). 

If Melnyk hadn't meddled so much, would Dorion have made half of the bad moves that he made? Hard to say.

If Melnyk hadn't meddled so much, would Karlsson have signed? Almost guaranteed.

So is everything Dorion's fault? Melnyk's? Who knows for sure?"

"This game takes place two weeks before the Trump election. Right before and after there is a documented spate of xenophobia and racism, particularly toward hispanics and Muslims.

And there's definitely more subtle and mature elements of racism here: The clerk at the gas station gives him the third degree and watches him more closely, but is not aggressive and does not use slurs like her husband.

As for the police shooting, they did that well. They clearly portrayed at the cop was agitated and there was a kid wheezing on the ground in front of him and he had no idea what just happened. He seemed inexperienced and panics. Esteban doesn't get down on the ground as ordered. These are all ingredients that typically lead to tragic shootings. They could have had the cop shout slurs and fire wildly, but they didn't. They were more realistic about it."

"A lot of it comes down to practice and getting used to faster and faster footspeed.

Your form shouldn't change for drills. Keep your feet flat, and when you pick them up off the panel, move them as little as possible. I've found that, counterintuitively, it helps to relax my legs as much as possible instead of tensing up in order to try to move them faster. When I'm relaxing my legs, I barely pick them up off the pad at all, which lets me drill dramatically more quickly and consistently.

And again, the more you practice footspeed, the easier drills will get. Playing songs at 200+BPM, as well as slow tempo songs with 24ths and 32nds, will help you build your footspeed until you can comfortably tackle drills at 130-140BPM. And then you'll improve from there.

You also mentioned going too fast because you're just trying to hit the arrows as quickly as you can. This can definitely be an issue. Make sure you're always keeping time with the song, even during streams and technical sections. I usually [count the rhythm](https://www.musical-u.com/learn/talking-rhythm-counting-101-2-3-4/) under my breath when following the beat gets tricky."

"There are a lot of things that can be improved on this build. 

- Why have you picked a two generation old line of processors with Skylake? Coffee Lake or Ryzen are both much better choices and not to mention, the i7 6700 is a locked processor, which means that you can't overclock it and you have an expensive CPU cooler and  motherboard that are oriented to overclocking.

- Ideally, you'd want to get a GPU that isn't a reference model from Nvidia or AMD, go for any of the board partners versions that have aftermarket coolers on them, you'll get better cooling and less noise that way.

I'd make some suggestions to improve your build, but unless you tell us what your budget is and what you intend to do with your PC as well, you'll be able to get better assistance that way.

Assuming you want a powerful gaming PC that can also be good for any workloads you have and your budget is ~$2300, I'd go for something like this, it gives you a better CPU, GPU, PSU, case, peripherals and a bigger SSD.

"[female gamers by genre study](https://quanticfoundry.com/2017/01/19/female-gamers-by-genre/)

Kotaku (an extremely left-leaning/ID politics gaming site) even cited this same study.

I realize its not an ""end all"" study (not a huge sample), but it shows that about 4-7% of the FPS/Tactical shooter genre gamers are female.

I realize the first poster was using anecdotal evidence, but it jives with my experience as a gaming store manager for 5+ years. Women were far more attracted to the MMOs, RPGs, and puzzles, in my experience.

So his initial claim of ""women don't buy Battlefield"" is pretty valid. Regardless of what product you're selling, pandering to 4-7% of your audience is a rather big gamble to bank on."

"Not sure on my type.

**Ethical framework**: Morality is both a very real mental force and a language used between people. Managing it as a mental force means minimizing dissonance between your morality and objective reality both by making your reality reflect your morality (by acting morally) and by altering your morally as your knowledge of the world expands. Managing it as a language between people means using it to build bonds and avoid potential enemies while avoiding it to justify yourself to others (both because there's usually some dissonance there and because it comes off as obnoxious to everyone outside of your faction).

**Philosophical framework**: I study all sorts of philosophy in order to improve my ""loops."" That is to say that my life, and life in general, is often about repeating cycles/habits/patterns. Each time a loop runs through it changes slightly, like how memories change upon recall. Using different philosophical ideas/frameworks, combined with introspection and journaling, helps me push those loops towards the direction I want."

No. We can’t “all” agree on this. Just because you don’t like someone we should not be labeling them as “mentally ill”. It’s like the new buzz word for people who used to use the word “retarded”.

"Drunk, even kids know better."
"My children have said similar things to me. More like, ""You did so much for us."","" I couldn't afford kids"", ""I'm too selfish to put kids ahead of myself"". I would say to you that children don't need all of the things your parents did for you (and I did for my kids) to be happy. As kids, my generation had to fit into our parents lives, but as parents we changed our lives for our kids. There is no way my dad would have listened to kids music on a long car trip. His car, his music. As parents we bought cars with TVs and listened to Disney movies every time we drove anywhere. My parents would see me in the talent show once, not sat through every rehearsal and every show. As a kid I don't think travel sports even existed, but my family had many years of spending weekends in different cities watching 4 kids  play travel hockey. Back then extra cirriculars started in middle school (except Girl/Boy Scouts), not at the age of 4.  We were a generation that had been taught by society that our kids should come first, always, so they got our time, money (which we had), and unquestioned support whatever they chose to do. In retrospect, I'm not sure it was the best choice for them or us, for many reasons. Your children don't need to be the pampered, center of your universe. They need to be loved and taught and an equal piece of the entire family. Choose to have kids or don't, but don't feel like you aren't worthy because their lifestyle will be different from yours."

"&gt;Do you buy cheap helmets because of this? 

How often are you crashing and hitting your head? If this is a factor you're doing something wrong. This is kind of like asking 'Do you buy a cheap car because of the cost of replacement after crashing it?'

&gt;Also, what's the deal with multi-impact helmets? This is how BMX brain buckets are described. Doesn't it make them simply better than cycling helmets? Could somebody explain it to me?

BMX helmets are designed for riding at skateparks and dirt jumps and stuff like that, not for riding on the road. Speeds are usually a lot lower and the helmet is designed more to protect the skull from hitting sharp edges and from scrapes and scratches than to absorb single big impacts. The helmet is likely to get a lot of minor scrapes and scratches vs a road helmet and so is designed to stand up to those.

Also similarly helmets like that are typically worn by kids who will almost always treat their helmets poorly like dropping them etc, you'd have to be rich to keep replacing your kid's regular helmet every time that happened."

Then it might help to give an idea of what kind of questions, problems, topics, concerns, perspectives, methods, etc. that you find compelling. 

Because, as it stands, the question invites what the answerer considers compelling, which might not match up with your own. There's never been a philosopher who hasn't been criticized, repudiated, or dismissed in one way or another, so your original question is still very difficult to gauge without tapping into one's own philosophical interests, judgments, etc. To ask generally about overrated philosophers, and answers in this forum seek to represent philosophy in general, is kind of asking for the consensus that's against the consensus.

&gt;It doesn’t mean that Kavanaugh is innocent of assault

I agree, Kavanaugh being innocent has nothing to do with ""a few hateful people.""

&gt;If he is innocent of assault it doesn’t excuse his perjury.

This is the what I love the most about your hypocrisy - it's apparently ""a job interview"" whenever you fail to present any sort of evidence for your slander or for whenever the accusers commit perjury, but the moment Kavanaugh needs to backtrack on talking about a fart joke in high school, suddenly it's a serious court case!"

&gt; LONDON - The UK would crash out of the EU without a deal rather than pursuing a soft Brexit, Dominic Raab will warn today.

&gt; Speaking at the Conservative conference in Birmingham, the Brexit secretary will warn the UK will be &amp;quot;Left with no choice&amp;quot; but to pursue a no-deal Brexit if the EU fails to offer a favourable agreement.

&gt; Raab will insist that his approach to negotiations is &amp;quot;Pragmatic, not dogmatic&amp;quot; and say the UK&amp;#039;s proposed divorce deal &amp;quot;Manages the risks of Brexit.&amp;quot; Notably his speech does not appear to name-check the &amp;quot;Chequers,&amp;quot; which refers to Theresa May&amp;#039;s divisive Brexit blueprint.

I stayed for a weekend once, on a Sunday afternoon I asked what he wanted to do. He said well I have to go get groceries. I was like oh well while you do that I’ll go home and do laundry. He was text arguing me the entire time I was home doing laundry. Got so mad changed the locks on me told his kid at the front room when I stopped by to get my weekend belongings that she should not open the door to me. Teenager. She didn’t open the door. I stood there til he did. 

He wouldn’t get out of my face while I grabbed my very few belongings: some food from the kitchen, items from the bedroom. Screaming in my face making it virtually impossible to think or grab my things. Ripped my bag from my hand completely ripping the bag apart doing so. 

I called the cops. They acted like jerks to me telling me get my stuff and go. My stuff was all over the floor now because of him. I think even the shopping bag I grabbed got ripped up by him. Horrifying. I left there and next day He finally agreed to try meds. It helped A LOT and we’re still together but he can still be completely irrational and loves me to death but some parts of his life I’m not allowed to talk about or he gets fired up. Areas like his kid, planning our wedding, God, his home which he was supposed to get ready for me to move into a year ago. Ya know. Small unimportant topics. 

I’ve tried breaking up with him at least 6-8 times in 3+ years. He would never let me. Meanwhile I don’t know if it’s love or him just trying to waste my time intentionally keeping me from moving on and being happier. "

"I think my main problem with it, is that it takes a bit long to reveal the more surreal and less straightforward intent, so when going into just expecting some dark crime drama, the very self serious and barebones acting and dialogue comes across as wooden and unintentionally comic almost. It’s not until later that I started to reinterpret and appreciate it. It’ll probably actually fare better on a second watch, knowing what is going into it."

"I got back into pc gaming in my late 30’s after having stopped for the better part of 15 years. I almost exclusively play RPG games and I’ve found that, while I still enjoy the tactical combat, gear finding, and character leveling aspects of the game,  I cannot really immerse myself in the stories the way I used to be able to do when I was younger. It’s almost like I judge myself for caring too much about something that’s ‘just a stupid game’.

Also, while I love the idea of exploring an open world, I start feeling anxious and impatient when it seems like I’m not making progress toward an objective. It’s hard to not start thinking of all of the things that I should probably be working on instead.

Maybe just maybe it’s because people are proud of Britain and the nation that they are so mortified and embarrassed by the insanity of Brexit.


This isn’t comparable with a dome or a sporting event.

It’s the largest and riskiest political decision outside of both world wars. It’s already leading to a constitutional and legal crisis on parts of the union there is the very real risk that it tears the uk apart as a nation, literally. England and Wales Do not equate to the UK.

Let’s not even get into the uncertainty in trade of goods or services,  that services hasn’t even been mentioned, that we now have a minister for food security, we have active plans for massive border tail backs, are briefing the police and military in actions in the event of food and medical supply shortages.

At the very least I hope the fastening runs down the centre of his jacket with buttons or laces - at the moment he reminds me too much of Negan from TWD there tbh.

That's what I'm going to call myself the next time I feel bad about eating half a jar of Jif with a spoon. 
"For me it felt like a story within a story. Reality (the real story) was that I knew when I was leaving to go to the casino the worst that could happen, which was exactly how much in total I could get from the ATM plus cash I had on me. The story within the story was that I consciously believed I would employ any variation or combination of strategies to play sanely and leave with money. The end to the story was always the worst that could happen, or close to it - either that day or within a few days. 

  
Now the worst that can happen is spending too much on groceries.  I still get depressed sometimes in repaying debt, and comparing where I am with where I should be financially. But there is comfort in knowing it won't get worse.  I can survive occasional depression. I could not survive any more of those morning after realizations that my paycheck is gone the same day it arrives and now I have to do so much worrying and calculating to make it through the month when I could have just had the money there in my checking account. The price is too high for us. 

  
Reset your counter and try again. Keep trying until it sticks. Quitting isn't like Dorothy going from black and white to color, it takes a while for the benefits to become noticeable because at first you're still fixing things that have been neglected. But I guarantee it's worth it.

If you can see 200 hours with no new exotics, and we know there’s no system in place to protect against bad luck, no Xur, not fated engrams, no duplicate protection, not even guaranteed new exotics when exotics drop in the new raid.

&gt; A senior Hamas official on Sunday accused Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas of fomenting violence in the region and pushing Israel toward a new war in the Gaza Strip.

&gt; Kahlil al-Hayya, a senior member of the Hamas political bureau, told Gaza newspaper Felesteen that the ruling terrorist group would respond with a &amp;quot;Free hand&amp;quot; against any additional measures imposed by the rival Ramallah government headed by Abbas.

&gt; Abbas has slashed funding to Gaza and cut salaries of PA employees there to pressure Hamas into handing over the territory, making it increasingly difficult for Hamas to govern.

Chances are good his progressive-focused party will hold power for another term.  Up here, we're about the same population as Texas, and there are a lot of demographic similarities - less hardcore churchies, but we still have our nutters in the rural areas and around the oil fields.

"Bare Minerals is my absolute favorite line of makeup and ever since I invested in a decent makeup line I’m not tempted to browse cosmetic stores.  Which is great because is used to look for any excuse to try a new lipstick or foundation and end up with a bunch of makeup I didn’t use or like. 

I have one loose powder foundation, one concealer compact, lip liner, lip stick and an eyeshadow pallet all Bare Minerals. I use NYX liquid eyeliner, Maybelline Great Lash, and Burt’s Bees chapstick. 

I bought Physicians Formula brushes a few years ago which I wash once a month (I wear makeup maybe 6 times a month), and use a simple eye lash curler. 

My tips is to use what you have to get the look you want. For example I have two Burt’s bees lip balms one is for lips and the other is for eye brow wax. If I want to make my eyebrows look fuller I’ll stroke my eyebrow brush over the balm and then over a dark brown on my pallet. It looks natural and now I don’t have to buy eyebrow kits that are pretty much the same thing. Another thing I use is the loose powder foundation with a drop of coconut oil if I have dry skin and need a thicker foundation coverage. Or if it’s summer I apply baby sunscreen on my face first and then apply powder and it really helps the foundation blend and set nicely. Also, the 70 spf is unbeatable. 
If I want blush I’ll lightly dab lipstick on my cheeks. I don’t follow trends like highlighting but if I wanted to go for that look I’d just use shimmer from my BM eyeshadow pallet.

"Go in and ask to speak to the apprenticeship coordinator. He should be able to guide you in the right direction of how that local handles things, as it is his job. I would show up in person. If he’s not there, show up again. Most union hands respect the effort over someone who just calls or drops an email. 

I know that 72 is hard up for hands manning their shutdowns, so it may be a good idea to be applying to that local. They could probably use the help. 

If they give you the run around, you could always try local 150 in Augusta, GA. They have a huge job of the only nuke being built in the US right now. Their apprenticeship program is in full swing, as well as their 18 week welding program. 

Just remember to take it seriously. Act professional and if and when you receive your call, do all you can to work hard, show up on time, and listen. You’ll have your hands full as an apprentice but you can make a hell of a living and it’s worth what you put in.

Best of luck to ya."

It meant a lot. It's hard. Every day is hard and she's almost 2 now. It's good for her though. She's learning lots of things and socializing with kids her own age more than I would be able to do by myself. She has more structure than I could ever hope to achieve on my own. And this kid needs structure like nobody's business. Some women are cut out to be Sahm's. I'm not. I own that. I need to work for my own mental health. Maternity leave made me realize that and it was still hard to do the daycare thing. Some women want to but can't due to finances.

"SNL used to be *the* launching pad for comedians. It was kind of a rite of passage. Back then it was hilarious. They once had Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Mike Meyers, Dana Carvey, David Spade, Chris Rock, and Phil Hartman on the show at the same time. People like Bill Murray, Will Ferrell, Robert Downey Jr, Jimmy Fallon, Eddie Murphy, and Chevy Chase got their start there. Nowadays the best comedians go straight to Hollywood or Netflix or whatever and SNL gets left with for the most part mediocre comedians that overstay their welcome. Guys like Kenan Thompson and Kate McKinnon who are *sorta* funny here and there, but not the best of the best like they used to have. Where SNL used to be chock full of really funny people, nowadays they attempt to make up for their shortcomings in that dept by becoming increasingly political.

Doctors usually only test TSH level, but it usually takes 10 years of thyroid dysfunction, for TSH to be above normal range. If you have not had a full thyroid panel with free T3 and free T4 levels tested, I would strongly recommend getting that done. Hypothyroidism is really common but horribly underdiagnosed. Your symptoms seem to fit, so it's worth getting a full panel to properly rule it out, if nothing else. "

"I visited villagers in the western Africa that were terrified of black dogs (evil spirits) forget about white children.  When the Spanish traveled across the the ocean the people they found in the Americas were convinced they were seeing spirits when they laid eyes on the conquistadors atop a horse.

So you think these people in west Africa (part of the 2/3's) would be less likely to react badly (I'm assuming you mean less likely to initially think a spirit is involved) when said super hero appears.  

I think the average Christian would be less likely to think a man with claws coming out of his hands was associated with any spiritual being.  Why?  Because the average Christian likely lives in North America or Europe and has seen some of the very same movies, TV shows, comic books, that you have and is more likely to think X-Men than trumpets sounding.

Once I was open to the idea of eating mushrooms, I went out hunting for them with one of my friends, and I was thoroughly amazed at the flavors present in some of the wild species that commercial mushrooms just can't compare to. Chicken of the Woods in particular is amazing. It actually tastes like chicken that's been fried up with some mushrooms, and the texture is remarkably meaty as well. If I had steady access to those mushrooms, I would strongly consider never eating chicken again (or at least much more sparingly)."

*****
&gt; Beirut - A formerly US-backed Syrian rebel group on Saturday rejected a deal between Russia and Turkey to avert a large-scale military assault on rebel-held Idlib province.

&gt; The deal makes way for a demilitarised zone between rebel and regime-held areas in and around the northwestern governorate, Syria&amp;#039;s last insurgent bastion.

&gt; Pro-Turkey rebels have cautiously accepted the deal, but the Jaysh al-Izza faction on Saturday rejected it, saying the zone to be set up by October 15 would only encompass territory currently under rebel control.

"I have two problems with this sort of argumentation. The first one is that we already have (and had for a very long time) the productive and logistical capacity to provide every single person on this planet to live a dignified life with basic needs being met. Yet more than half of the world goes through soulcrushing poverty. The second one is the claim that automation will bring poverty or whatever. The thing is that poverty already rules over the majority of the world's population. The only thing that automation will bring is poverty to the average person who are living in inflated and parasitical economies of the West. All these analyses or arguments or whatever in the direction you point towards are so bewilderingly blind and only pertain to the First World it is beyond belief. The center of the mass of today's production is already in the Third World yet all we talk about regarding automation is how some white collar job is going to become obsolete. If we are talking about capitalism and communism, which are global systems, let me ask you this then: Why should we even care about all of these parochial tendencies?"

"Hi, I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to create a harmonious house between this little psycho (Stormi \[almost 3 months old\]) my wife and I got three weeks and our 11 year old grump Ruca. Ruca has been our only cat for the last 10 years. I was apprehensive about bringing another cat into our house since Ruca has never had to share the house and figured she might be a bit too set in her ways, but a my wife has a friend that had kittens and she had to have one. I'm trying to make this as stress free as possible for everyone. So far I can tell that the new kitten in the house has been stressing Ruca out, as is to be expected. She'll still sleep in the room with us, but I've notice changes in her behavior like laying in places she doesn't normally hang out, and spending a lot of time isolated up in our bedroom.  So far this is how we have been trying to handle it.

* Week 1 - We kept Stormi isolated in our guest bedroom for the first week with everything she needed (food, litter box, toys , etc) My wife and I tried to divide our time between bonding with the new kitten and hanging out with our resident cat. We would take turns with one of us sleeping in the room with the kitten, and one of us sleeping in the bed with Ruca. Ruca inspected the door a couple of time and hissed at it
* Week 2 - Ruca was spending a lot of time isolating herself in our bedroom, so we figured it would be a good time to let Stormi to start exploring the house and spreading her scent around so that Ruca could slowly get used to the idea of another cat in the house. After we get home from work we close off our bedroom so Stormi wouldn't bother Ruca, then later in the evening would put Stormi back in her room so Ruca could come downstairs and hang out with us before it was time for bed. Towards the end of the week we put up a gate separating the house hoping to get them used to seeing each other and feeding near the gate, but Ruca would avoid Stormi. We also got a pen to put Stormi in so they could meet, but Stormi didn't like being in there and I figured it would just cause unneeded stress. Ruca and Stormi did have their first face to face with Stormi in the pen, and I was able to get them to eat near each other. With Ruca hissing a little, then going over to look out the door like she enjoys doing.
* Week 3 - We kept up the same routine from week two for most of the third week  with dividing the house and Ruca seeming to be a little less apprehensive about meeting the kitten. We noticed her yesterday meowing at the bedroom door while Stormi was in the living room so I figured it was time for a face to face sans barriers. We opened the door and I sensed a stare down commencing so I got between them to break the eye contact while my wife grabbed Stormi's favorite toy. Once I started playing with Stormi and she wasn't focused on Ruca, Ruca climbed up on the chair with my wife and laid down watching me play with Stormi. We did this for about an hour then put Stormi to bed. Ruca spent most of today up in the bedroom, but came down this afternoon. Again there was another stare down, more playing, then since it was dinner time for Stormi we figured we'd feed them together with the bowls spaced about 8 ft apart. They both ate without any issue then when they were done Stormi wanted to attack. I was able to distract her with her toy and Ruca just carried on looking out the door, but she did not seem to like when Stormi would approach her though. She'd hiss, and growl, but once I got Stormi's attention she was fine. After a while I tried to end the play session and things started getting a little tense between them so we divided the house again to keep them in separate parts for the evening.

I'd like to know what I can do to keep Stormi from wanting to attack the older cat. Is this something that she will eventually stop of as she gets more used to Ruca's presence? Should I just keep up with trying to feed them together and play with Stormi with Ruca in the room?"

"&gt; Are you open to the Coburn amendment which allows NICS checks to be performed by the public?

I've not read it, so I don't have an opinion on it. As a state legislator, I wouldn't be able to make a decision on it. That said, I do support opening up MULES (which feeds into NICS) to a wider audience. (Although not necessarily to the public; maybe allow people to pay for a background check at the Sheriff's department with consent from both parties.)

&gt;Additionally, do you believe in background checks for all private sales?

Since we don't have licensing of specific firearms the way we do cars, this wouldn't be implementable. I'm not really in favor of a gun database, so this wouldn't be enforceable, so I couldn't support passing it.

&gt;Also, how do you reconcile the necessity of a permit when states with constitutional carry have shown no increase in violent crime?

I'd say that most of the studies I've read about this have had no conclusion, and that most people talk about it with anecdotal evidence. I'd be happy to read studies that show constitutional carry is safer, but it would have to include accidental deaths and injuries as well. In Missouri, there have been a few news reports, (even though this is anecdotal) about people being shot by weapons that are improperly stored in their vehicles or carried on their person. It's not just about violent crime.

Thanks!"

"Those wiimotes you're referring to, it becomes hand presence. And when you have hand presence, things around you become tactile. Socializing with your hands and head add a big layer of depth to online interactions. Reloading and aiming down the sights with a gun make that gun very real.

I can box people, have gunfights with people, high five people, I can trick my senses into thinking I'm at the bottom of the ocean.

"My first road bike and my first new bike in 20 years. 

I know there’s a ton of feelings that The Internet has about the hover bar cockpit but I’ve gotten over the unfamiliar nature of it pretty quick. 

Things I love: 

1.	It’s a super stiff, responsive bike in general but the lack of mass is ridiculous. It’s listed as 8.2kg mostly due to the 830g frame and the 1500g wheels. They spin up so fast I feel like I’m 17 again :-)

2.	Ultegra Di2 is a dream—flawless shifting, but the main reason for the upgrade over a perfectly doable 105 groupo came after many test rides the last few months. I never got over how disconcerting it felt to have the brake lever pull laterally when trying to brake. Rather than switching to SRAM I found myself drawn to Di2 every time. 

3.	The 40mm tires and the overall comfort from the cockpit and flexing seat post makes it glide over pot holes and unevenness of Chicago roads. 

I know that I still have the dork disc on my back wheel but I honestly don’t know how to take it off. Do I just have to break it off? I would love to avoid taking the rear cassette apart as I saw on YouTube once. "

In this case Kavanaugh is not being prosecuted; he is being confirmed for a lifetime appointment.  A FBI investigation is prudent and perfectly in line with the Senate's roll of confirmation.

However it sure appears the FBI probe is a sham.  It is purposely excluding Julie Swetnick and Sunday night, two days into a seven day investigation, Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez has not even been contacted by the FBI yet.

I got to admit you right wingers screw over Democrats like under Obama filibustering every judge nomination and refusing to hold hearings for over a year for his Supreme Court pick.  And how do Democrats respond?  Weak puppy dog Schumer fast tracks a bunch of judicial nominations and Democrats calling for an investigation of an accused rapist is a witch hunt and barely happened."

Also, because people reify these mental formations they have so much trouble with them.  If you can avoid reifying those elements of experience, they become much more malleable and controllable.  The same thing happens with any disease.  A disease that sticks around is generally a reified mental formation too, and those people who don't reify experience related to the body do not experience as many diseases because it's harder for an unwelcome pattern to solidify and establish itself if you don't hold it to be real."

"It isn't about other progressions, it's about understanding that you don't need to jump right from one to the other.

Keep doing the one-leg holds that don't bother you, and every other week stick your tucked leg out JUUUUUSSSST a little further.

That's all you have to do on the static end, seriously.

I'd do more than 50% of your single best hold, that's just not enough time. 

I'd use the same 2-3 reps left in the tank strategy that works well for heavy lifting, and do holds that are 70-80% of your max good form hold time.

If you think you can JUST do direct training, you're either listening to the wrong advice or you're lying to yourself. Not trying to be mean, but we need to be honest about what works.

You need curls, push ups, overhead pressing (yes HeSPU count), rows, and pull ups, all programmed properly for strength training. That means a minimum of 12 sets per week.  You need a minimum of 5-6 reps per set, but you should be totally comfortable working up to as many as 15 reps per set because that's still optimal hypertrophy range, as long as you follow the next piece of advice as well.

You also need to be using a 2-4 second eccentric for those movements on each rep. You can start with 2 seconds and work up to the longer ones, that's a great strategy someone mentioned earlier that allows you to add useful volume without adding a ton of time to your workout, and since you're already confused on a lot of things I think that's where you should start.

If you do all that, you WILL start seeing safe and reliable progress. 

The tempo does matter, and going slower than 4 seconds doesn't make you stronger... it actually produces less strength and less hypertrophy to do 6+ second eccentrics, which is why ALL of the superslow programs that were popular 10 years ago have completely disappeared.

Superslow advice still floats around, but it is bad advice for strength training. The only time to use slower movement than that is form correction, and that's a totally separate topic."

"If you thought NC's mention in this fiasco was ended with Ford's undergraduate degree at UNC, oh no.

This just came in from the WaPo:

Charles Ludington, a former varsity basketball player and friend of Kavanaugh’s at Yale, told The Washington Post on Sunday that he plans to deliver a statement to the FBI field office in Raleigh on Monday detailing violent drunken behavior by Kavanaugh in college.

Ludington, an associate professor at North Carolina State University, provided a copy of the statement to The Post.

In it, Ludington says in one instance, Kavanaugh initiated a fight that led to the arrest of a mutual friend: “When Brett got drunk, he was often belligerent and aggressive. On one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with Brett, I witnessed him respond to a semi-hostile remark, not by defusing the situation, but by throwing his beer in the man’s face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail.”

Ludington says he was deeply troubled by Kavanaugh appearing to blatantly mischaracterize his drinking in Senate testimony.

“I do not believe that the heavy drinking or even loutish behavior of an 18 or even 21 year old should condemn a person for the rest of his life,” Ludington wrote. “However ... if he lied about his past actions on national television, and more especially while speaking under oath in front of the United States Senate, I believe those lies should have consequences.”
_____
""....and more especially while speaking under oath in front of the United States Senate, I believe those lies should have consequences.""

So do I, so does the FBI, DOJ, and US Senate.  Let's see which party decides that lying under oath is ""unbecoming"" for a Supreme Court Justice.  I mean, come on -- can we have a Justice that lies to get on the bench actually opine and judge on a criminal trial?

&gt; OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau worked the phones, officials gathered at his office and Canadian stakeholders were called to Ottawa as negotiators came within striking distance of reaching a three-country NAFTA deal on Sunday.

&gt; One person outside government pegged it at around 40 percent larger than current Canadian exports to the U.S. Two sources said the issue is likely, but not certain, to find itself in a separate agreement and not in the main NAFTA text.

&gt; One senior Canadian official joked: &amp;quot;There&amp;#039;s a special place in hell for people who call a deal done before it&amp;#039;s done.""

I spent probably 2 hours trying to slot enough debuffing and healing without losing my two Summoners to effectively take him out. I could get through Bergen and Ghis without issue, but Gabranth murdered me every time around 10-15% HP remaining. I forget who suggested it in the main thread, but someone pointed out that Auron USB1 was the only counter available for that specific buff, so I tried it out. Cut his damage completely in half, if not down to a third, and my healer still had two USB casts available at the end of the fight."

"I wouldn't mind an extra event weapon too. I was really excited for the event weapons coming back to the store, but it is quite underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, the Pulverizer is a great weapon - just not for everyone, only Constructors. 

Adding another weapon (snipers/launchers/ARs) to the store would be great for everyone, and wouldn't make that much of a big deal as the Cram Session is supposed to be short. So, essentially, it's only adding 3-4 more weapons to the store, and it would actually let people spend the horde of gold you get from the event itself (which is kinda the point of the event), as the 5k gold cap is ridiculous too. Double gold &amp; not increasing the number of store items/their purchasable quantity - pretty dumb. Agree with OP."

For me it required a total change in perspective.  I started with the 100 Happy Days challenge.  Not even posting everything but making sure to take a picture that shows the universe is good and maybe sharing it with a friend.  You eventually start looking at and looking _for_ the good in things.  The world is a beautiful place when you take time to admire it.  People are not the horrible assholes you think they are when you stop obsessing over their flaws and start appreciating what you like about them.  Even your shitty job has things that make you interested or feeling competent and valuable.  Focus on those!  I was so wrapped up in negativity that it took a while to unwind but it really was a life changing experience.  I should note that in the middle of the challenge my brother-in-law died of an early heart attack.  I took that day off but then resumed being thankful for my health and being able to be there to support my family.  I don’t think I would have been able to recover so quickly had I not flipped my perspective.  Nowadays people frequently comment on how annoyingly positive and trust me nobody would have ever said that before!

"&gt;I’d be pissed if Feinstein made it known when Ford asked her not to. Not fair to the victim

I'd be pissed, too, if Feinstein *outed* the victim. But protecting the victim's identity does not require Feinstein to conceal the very fact that these allegations of this kind had been made. These facts are manifestly relevant. Shielding the victim's identity does not excuse her from performing her duty to fight the Republican nominee. Making the existence of these allegations known sooner, rather than stonewalling till her hand was forced by Ryan Grim's reporting, would have encouraged other women to come forward sooner. I'm frankly disgusted that the notion of ""victim's rights"" are being thrown around in this nonsensical manner to excuse Feinstein's behavior."

"There's prejudice against bi men in the gay male community. 

Some of the gems I've heard:

""You're gay. You just don't know it yet.""

""You should just choose.""

""You just want more sexual opportunities."" (*like, dur.*)

There's also the sense that you're not committed to the cause, which I can appreciate actually. If I'm with a woman, nobody would know I'm bi unless I told them.

Maybe I'm just the same though, because I think most people, gay or straight, are at least a little bit bi. "

"The problem is that a large portion of the reason this model worked for China is due to a lack of competition and uninformed buyers and workers.

The more the workers in China become aware of how bad they have it and the more buyers refuse to accept products from companies that take advantage of this cheap labor source the less viable it becomes. At the same time they don't want to accept moving on from this situation and are trying to fight it.

It's a weird situation and it's made more complicated by the massive population in China meaning they're running into ""problems"" with advancing technology making it harder to keep that population employed etc.

It's one thing to employ thousands of workers in a factor at effectively slave labor rates of pay when you're making money off of it, but automation is making even that become less viable as it's becoming an even cheaper alternative. Then you have all these people who you can't even employ at the lowest costs."

If someone sent you an invitation to join the Jehovah's witnesses, and you **COMPLETELY, ON YOUR ON VOLITION** joined the Jehovahs witnesses, would you claim ""that person **made** me a member?""

You most certainly chose to become a moderator, you even admitted so earlier, yet you keep on repeating the lie: ""my friend made me."" If you repeat a lie enough times, it does not become true. 

It was brought to light that you were a mod of a sub making fun of traditional Catholics.

**The sub is absolutely dedicated to making fun of traditional Catholics.** I found the sub rude and unfunny from what I could see of it. And I'm not a 'traditional Catholic.'

You are doing several things: firstly, trying to distance yourself, saying 'it was a long time ago, my friend *made* me a mod, (when you chose to become a mod in truth), and saying the sub only had a few posts. 

So yeah, you did not *create* the sub, but you have had a hand in the sub. 

You are also trying to divert from the truth of the sub making fun of Traditional Catholics. It was making fun of them. You try to say 'it was okay because it was mild.' Firstly, I didn't find it mild. Secondly, you were making fun of them. 

My opinion of you has fallen greatly. 

Every chance you have to set a good example, every chance you have to take moral route, you do not.

"Huge fan of Robinhood, No commissions is awesome. Your explanation is spot on. Compounding just means your gains earn a gain ever year going forward. Single company stocks and etfs both compound. Tip: The data shows wallstreet experts rarely beat market benchmarks like the s&amp;p500(500 largest US based companies) so your best bet is to put most of your money in a low cost etf like the s&amp;p500. (Ticker: SPY is a market favorite for this)👍"
"If you look at the 'customisation' tab for any tank, you'll see the decorators bit.  That's where the bushes are kept.  Even if you were to buy all 11, you'd only be able to apply 6 to the tank at any one time.  More importantly, you are only allowed to apply one of each type.  Once you've stuck a bush on, you need to select a different type to add if you want to add more.

However, when bushes were first introduced, you could buy 'the 6 pack' of the biggest and thickest bushes.  This meant that you could add 6 of the same type to your tanks at the same time.  So you could just pick the ""Bunch of Branches, big (foliage tree)"" 6 times and place it all over your tank.  For a whole load of tanks, that means the entire front is obscured behind them.

They soon realised that this was a fuck up and that it granted people a ludicrous advantage over their opponents and so stopped the sale and changed it to what it is now (my first paragraph).  But those who bought the original 6 pack were allowed to keep their bushes so now what we have is a situation where people who bought the 6 pack have access to the advantage but no one else is."

For most most of 2017 before and after the contentious fork BTC was under constant spam attacks. Only now has it subsided, now that miners money (the ones supporting the forked version) are less than they used to be.

Again, neither XRP or XLM had such powerful adversaries ... yet. Stress testing a network is not just spamming it. It can be attacking it whichever way is it available. 

There was simply not enough incentive to attack those two networks yet. Bitcoin was attacked repeatedly and savagely and survived. Billions were stuck against it (as evidenced by the constant transactions and the sockpuppet war that had to be financed against it and it survived).

Again, XRP and XLM have not found itself against potent adversaries. Let me see them survive *that* and I will be more safe in supporting those networks."

If the home is priced correctly it will sell just as easily, but they don’t do much work for you in the way of setting up showings etc.  Is it worth saving the money though? I think absolutely.

In short, it can work or it can be a nightmare, but you can have a nightmare experience with a full price realtor as well.

"Sex offender registries. Now please, hear me out...and just so you know, I am NOT on any sex offender registry...but i know some who are...and you can get on these registries for something as stupid as pissing in the woods (there are plenty of people that are actually on these registries for just that, and there are plenty also who have never touched or molested ANYONE). A lot of them have to be on these registries for life. People don't care WHY they're on there, they just find out they are and then shun them and make them the scourge of society. They're limited on where they can live, where they can work (and it's very difficult for them to find a job even in an industry that will hire them). I think everyone, including ""sex offenders"", can and do get rehabilitated, and should be given a chance to go on with their lives. I believe to deny them that is a miscarriage of justice. They're are no ""murder registries"" or ""drug dealer registries"" etc...not even for murderers or drug dealers who targeted minors, so why is this particular group targeted to ruin the rest of there lives? If people can NEVER hope to stop being punished, what's the incentive to get rehabilitated? "

"There is good business rationale behind not cannibalizing your own business. In my line of work we call it biting one’s tail — you try to have one thing launch well but you end up coinciding with another thing (in this case within your own company, but the logic also applies to paying attention to the timing of competitors’launches/events) and as a result the finite resources (time, money) consumers have are divided across two events. If these are both all-digital or both ongoing, maybe that’s fine. But when one is an in-person event with real infrastructure costs (ie, in-person events have real setup costs that can’t be recouped without a certain number of butts in seats), this is a real risk.

That is, they lose very little by not enabling draft for a week and don’t risk cannibalizing the investment they made in in-person prereleases — there are still sealed events on MTGO, so there’s something for online-only folks, but maybe without draft they consider going to the LGS. Same goes for other draft formats — losing prerelease customers to MTGO is a much bigger loss than stymying online-only players for a week.

This is all to say that business is more complicated than “offer all the things all the time”. Which is why many businesses run by those with no business experience tend to not stay in business as long as they could otherwise."

"Look I would’ve voted Tyler just like I would’ve voted for Vanessa and Paul but their strategies, while entertaining, are high risk and pretty stupid if the purpose is to win. The issue is that people always find out they are pulling the strings in jury, or in the house which makes them get into multiple F2 deals that they ultimately have to break for protection. Both Vanessa and Tyler were outed as comp beasts and puppet masters halfway through the game. They both masterfully maneuvered this to the end but it really leads to a bitter jury or a smart player like Steve cutting you. I’m just not sure how much credit Tyler or anybody else should get for a strategy that has been proven over and over again not to work."
"Yeah I think it's fine to use for prepubescent kids because they all mostly sound the same. I have recordings of my brother and I and you can't tell which of us is the one talking.

Even the Japanese actress for Boruto doesn't sound like Boruto when she talks normally, she sounds like a woman. Does the Boruto English actor even try?  Half of it is the localization company, they are half responsible for the final sound of the character, both in how they cast, and in working with the actors on developing the final sound for the character. I have little faith in localizers anymore. There was a time when they were actually good but that was almost twenty years ago."

I handed back a test and one girl was like ""Mr. Borg so and so and I wrote the same thing but she got it right and I got it wrong."" I looked at it and I'll be darned she's right. I replied ""Well you both got it wrong so you don't get any points back but I won't mark her down.""

"Nope, no stamina, not for regular playing, which you can do endlessly. There is stamina for the pvp arena, to limit people from camping there for hours and racking up so many wins no one else can compete. Limited entries there helps keep the pvp leagues fair while not putting a waiting cap on gameplay itself. 

There's a single gacha but it's an unusual gacha system - you're not limited by your pulls (which are free on a quick timer, yes, but you earn more from playing) but by what you can afford to *hire* from your pulls - you have to play to earn the gold to be able to hire the good heroes, or get lucky with negotiating the price down. I am nearly always in the situation where it's not that I need more pulls, but more gold, and balancing out using gold for pulls versus leveling up my heroes' skills is a constant struggle. 

Every pull is useful and can be used, if for nothing else, than for sacrificing to get xp for your main hero (who can only gain xp that way, not through playing like the others can) and items that raise the level cap of your other heroes. The lowest rarity pulls can also be upgraded to the highest rarity.

The only ads in it are optional, uncommon, and give you free gems/premium currency. (Which is also given out free for playing at decent rates. Not especially generously, but they're definitely not stingy with it either. Closer to generous than stingy.

You can also pay once and not only remove ads permanently but get the rewards as if you'd watched them. (This is currently only in a really expensive bundle with a ton of gems though. Boo. But considering how many free gems you can easily get in a day with that, it may be pretty well worth it over time.)

It is, IMHO, gacha done really really well, and I'll be doing a full review of it closer to Halloween. "

Then you add Bucky to the mix, Tonys chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way at Civil War, Tonys got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Bucky KNOWS he can't beat Steve and he's not even gonna try!

So Tony , you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice. But then you take my 75% chance of winning, if we was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, I got 141 2/3 chance of winning at Civil War. See Tony, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Civil War."

"I'm a gay guy with no interest in casual sex. I considered demisexuality as s label for a time, but ultimately I realized that I do feel sexual attraction regardless of the emotional attachment. I like porn, I like looking and handsome guys-- I just don't want to actually invest myself in them in that way unless I'm going to try and build a relationship.

Unfortunately, I also have no business dating anyone, but that's a separate issue."

"Well, this is a legal advice sub, not one for moral opprobrium, and civility is about the person communicating, not about the recipient - I think descending into vulgarities is usually counter-productive!

Not to say there isn't a time and the place for it, but that's pretty rare on a sub that should generally be about dispassionate analysis of the realities of a situation."
"Like a very odd obsession? You're making me a bit worried. If you feel dysphoria you know it. There's a big difference between being obsessed and feeling dysphoria. Being obsessed with trans people, now that's creepy, much alike to weeaboos. Being obsessed is like fujoshis, etc.. Dysphoria is wanting to change yourself. Dysphoria is different from being obsessed with anything. You might have repetitive, or 'obsessive' thought about being born the wrong way, or disliking your physical form, but it's dysphoria, not obsession.

It's kind of confusing, but hopefully you get what I mean. 

You might be obsessed with the way you want to be, but it's kind of like objectification if you're obsessed with trans people. "

"Nice - I like the little bird skull addition.

That venus flytrap may end up dying off over time. They grow in soggy areas in the wild, but when they're kept indoors in terrariums the lower intensity lighting, high humidity, lack of airflow, and the lack of a seasonal cool dormant period often disagrees with them. The ferns should do quite well in there though!"

"Kind of an aside, but maybe not -- being unfamiliar with this as a name for either a drinking game **or** a sexual position, I turned to the trusty [Google n-grams.](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=devil%27s+triangle&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cdevil%20%27s%20triangle%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3BDevil%20%27s%20Triangle%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BDEVIL%20%27S%20TRIANGLE%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bdevil%20%27s%20triangle%3B%2Cc0)

So the term seems to have experienced a bit of a spike in usage roughly around Kavanaugh's junior high years, so far so good -- and according to the google books search results, mostly seems to be an alternate name for the Bermuda Triangle,  but also could be some sort of fruity pink beverage, based on one result. Or ""Alcohol, Women and Gambling,"" going by one fairly moralistic pamphlet.

Or some dumb in-joke from a high school yearbook that nobody remembers anymore.

In the latter case, I guess it may still be perjury to make something up about a drinking game, rather than say ""I don't remember"", but given the nature of the minefield it is somewhat understandable behaviour. "

"Thanks for taking the time. Of course I was going for this style. I made my first hiphop beat in 1998, that  might explain it lol... but btw: mine is actually pretty fast and waaay faster than yours. Yours is around 70bpm and mine is over 90. (No yours is not 140bpm just because you put that in FL, people just do that because it's easier than adjusting measures, you still count the actual full beats)

I want to preface this feedback with a full disclaimer that I do usually not listen to the style you are going for, so take my feedback with a grain of salt. I'll try to give constructive criticism as an experienced producer, but I am not the target audiece for this type of sound, so I might not be aware of some typical characteristics.

&amp;#x200B;

* intro does a good job of building suspense, which is nice
* the slow downs and lowpass filters are a nice touch to switch up the melody without it getting too repetitive (which is one of my main complaints about these type of beats usually, so good job).
* Some of the slowdowns feel a bit sluggish
* mostly good drum arrangement
* feel like the beat would bounce a bit better if you had more variation in the velocity of the kicks
* Bass works very well for this, I also like that you were not lazy and just took it out at some points like so many other people do. Instead you worked with it to make it fit the calmer parts and did a good job.
* I also saw your top level comment about the mix, I don't think you should adjust it before someone records on it and see what it needs then.
* My main gripe with it is that I don't like the main melody, but there's nothing wrong with it, that's really just personal taste, I think it's well done overall.

"I think most people in this thread have pretty much summed it up.

The only thing I want to add is that as with ALL technology, the price will eventually drop, and as VR really *isn't* just a fad (when you have one, you know why, but until then you really can't understand it, and as obnoxious as that sounds... it's coming purely from experience), as the price drops, more AAA companies will start making games for it. 

Despite my feelings on most AAA games, you can't say that they don't sell well. Once this starts happening with VR, and it *will*, it'll will be a standard part of gaming, though I can't fully see it taking the place of monitors and TVs as some people think it has to. It's just a different way of experiencing video games...

A much better way, IMO. I hated the Serious Sam games until VR... it literally turned a game series from one I don't like to one I adore."

"Hey, thanks for taking the time to reply!

I'm very much a fan of these skins, Jappa. I think, though, that what makes the current villagers so distinct is those clear separations of colors between careers. While these newer ones make distinctions between, say, the librarian and cartographer, I just don't think the differences are enough. For instance, I think every ""smith"" profession should have no sleeves at all; I see that the weaponsmith has black gloves and an eye-patch, but... that's the only distinction and the aprons have so little differences between them they may as well have none.

I just think the ideas are there and in need of revision, simplification of color/shape and maybe sacrifice 'detail' for readability. And can you answer if we've seen the Nitwits yet or have they not been shown off? What will those folks look like, and how are they distinct enough from all the other professions to convey visually that they cannot be clicked on? My final suggestion could be to maybe bring in a variety of skin colors (biome-specific or profession specific?) as a chance to bring in some representation or to further those readable distinctions between careers.

Looking forward to when snapshots start! Thanks again &lt;3"

I know the waiting game - I had to wait two weeks for my abortion and was utterly miserable. I spent most of that time reading other people's abortion stories and they made me feel a lot less alone and a lot better prepared. There are lots of [podcasts](http://theabortiondiary.com/), [profiles with real non-anonymous people](https://wetestify.org/stories/), and, of course, a lot of wonderful stories in this sub. At [ineedana.com](https://ineedana.com), we've been starting to collect stories tumblr and tag them with things folks might find relevant like ""[medical abortion](https://ineedanastories.tumblr.com/tagged/medical-abortion)"" stories. I personally really enjoyed the [Shout Your Abortion](https://shoutyourabortion.com) video we have (currently at the top) on that page.  

As for what to expect during the medical abortion, your PP should give you all the info, but [How To Use Abortion Pill](https://www.howtouseabortionpill.org/after/) is also a good resource. 

Are you in the U.S.? If so, there may be a full-spectrum doula that could provide you some support during your abortion. They're trained to support you through the process and hold space for you. It may help with your fear of feeling alone. We're in the process of adding doula info to [ineedana.com](https://ineedana.com), in the meantime, you may find [this list](https://radicaldoula.com/becoming-a-doula/volunteer-programs/) helpful. You can also PM me and I can help connect you with folks based on where you are. I'm a member of the Bay Area Doula Project and know a bunch of others around the country. 

If you just want someone to talk to, [All-Options](https://www.all-options.org/) toll free talk line is a great resource. They’re happy to talk about anything related to pregnancy, abortion, adoption, and parenting related. Their hotline is toll free and available Mon-Fri 10-1am, Sat-Sun 10-6pm EST  1-888-493-0092

When I told her and her dad what her eye looked like, they were shocked. ""the nurse said she could see it! She just couldn't get it out bc it was stuck!"" and ""how can there be such a big problem?

The Plant Derived Squalane feels amazing on the skin and I noticed after applying it before bed that I’d wake up with refreshed looking, supple skin. The Hyaluronic Acid also acts as a moisturiser as well as reducing the appearance of fine lines which is great. And the Salicylic Acid is fabulous for drying out breakout last quickly, just be mindful of using too much as it can severely dry your skin out, so moisturise after!!

#To Keep In Mind

LD = Lemon Demon

RtH = Rock the House

AB = Atomic Bonsai

WWW = Wild Wild West

THT = The Hanging Tree

* As long as Destiny is able to aim LD himself, its low inherent precision is a nonissue.

* Generally, it can be assumed that LD will attempt to dodge attacks on itself.

* RtH and Damon have equal speeds to Mute and Buffalo, so as long as they aren’t directly running away from him (which they can’t always do in this arena) he should be capable of cutting one of them off for a switch.

* Our team’s Naturally Oriented and Restaurateur give us a great amount of knowledge of our immediate area, reduce our chances of slipping on things (in fact, in r3m3, PHD made a similar argument for Damon on ice), and generally we’re unlikely to screw stupid things up.

* It was ruled ages ago that, if you’re ‘holding’ something, RtH swapping means Damon is now holding it, whereas it being ‘on your person’ (read: part of your inventory, or just generally kept on your body, IE Ivan and the briefcase) means you get to keep it. So for example, riding a skateboard and getting swapped means losing that too.

* The artifacts are indestructible as well as immune to stand effects.

* LD still has multiple extra sources of water on Destiny’s person if the fountains/ponds are damaged. There’s also the multiple restaurants here content to let him take whatever he wants, and generally any restaurant or food stand will have water.

* If someone is shrunken down *enough* by Atomic Bonsai, they cannot be RtH-d, but [this has to be an extremely dramatic size shift.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488000620180144139/495769837742718977/unknown.png) Discrepancies that aren’t to this level can still be swapped by virtue of RtH’s only needing to be *mostly* accurate and very mild morphing abilities.

#Opening Play

Our ideal earlygame could hypothetically involve taking out one of these two early on, practically immediately even. This starting position is perhaps the most advantageous place we have all match long, and if we lose that, the rest of the battle becomes more challenging, albeit not impossible.

**[Close to the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzKDmS0zAPo)**

*How do you like being blinded?! I win! Die!*

Right out the gate, Destiny will waste no time in rushing Buffalo Soldier with LD and its A speed, using an erratic movement pattern and blocking its body with its own tendrils to gain some protection from WWW’s threatening C-power shots.

If Buffalo is facing towards him, he will immediately spew high-pressure oil, first in his face, limiting his eyesight severely, then running down the rest of his body to generally douse him, before grasping him with LD’s A power and driving him into the ground. If he’s facing away, more or less reverse these steps, pulling back on Buffalo to ensure that he’s on his back before spraying from that position.

When he’s grounded and blinded, LD will pull Buffalo closer and closer to the duck fountain, swinging and shaking him the entire time, making sure to have him tightly (ideally, tight enough to break them, even) by the wrists.

Once Buffalo is close enough, Destiny will climb out of the fountain (see next section for why he’s there) drag the wild man to its edge. Damon, who will be nearby in one way or another, will get out his lighter and have RtH toss the lit thing at the gas-covered Buffalo, igniting him as Destiny tosses him into the fountain (any cook can tell you that [you do NOT use water for a grease-fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfIRx764-88)).

Destiny will carefully stay away from the massive fireball he’s just basically created in the duck fountain, while Lemon Demon remains inside, attacking Buffalo with tendril, tooth, and liquid, adding more oil to the fire if need be, until he’s certainly no more.

Destiny has also left The Hanging Tree inside there, to make getting it that much more unfeasible for Mute. The thing can’t be destroyed, after all. It may be at the cost of his easiest source of water, but so be it.



**[Rockit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ue714d1V6I)**

*Playing keep-away with one of these cosmic chumps… It kinda feels nostalgic.*

While Damon in general is a solid Southern wall for the match, a one-man way to stop the Rebels in their tracks should they try to run away, during the opening sections of the match, he will also be focusing on Mute. It’s reasonably likely that she’ll make a beeline for THT, so if so, Destiny will have to tank the weaker of his opponents briefly, basically tackling the thing into the water with him and making things a touch more complicated for Mute (he’ll still be watching LD and Buffalo mainly during this time). This buys Damon and RtH enough time to approach and, while she’s focusing on using AB for that, cut her off with a gravity-intensifying switch. Obviously, **he will only do this part if Mute goes for THT,** and **will absolutely be out of it by the time he turns the fountain into a fireball.**

If she tries to board South, past Damon, or book it to one side or the other, he won’t have trouble cutting her off and swapping her position. Inside a store, even very deft Mute will have to slow herself down a bit, after all. And of course, if she tries to attack Damon directly, that more or less guarantees that he’ll be able to get a swap in.

If she hurries Northeast, well… There’s not much, feasibly, we can do, with Destiny focusing on Buffalo, but since Destiny is a lot more offensively threatening than Damon, trying to go directly past him without knowing he’s focusing on Buffalo first is unlikely if her goal is to run, rather than fight. In any case, if Mute does anything that’ll make it clear she’ll get away from Damon unswapped, he’ll instead switch places with Buffalo, pretty much just making Destiny’s attacks on him significantly easier.

Either way, if Mute is able to be switched, a lot of good will come of it for us. If she was on her skateboard, Damon is now on it, and the gravity increase means he crushes it immediately. If she simply had it out, he and RtH can break it into pieces. If she’d somehow secured the artifact, it’s now in Damon’s hands instead. Either way, for a few precious seconds, Mute has been slowed dramatically, her great deal of mobility her usual greatest asset. The close-by Damon can throw his knife at her right after getting the swap off with RtH.

Destiny, no matter what state in the midst of his torture-murder of Buffalo he’s at, can break off a spare of one of LD’s tendrils by striking it hard against the edge of the fountain at an angle where Destiny has calculated it would launch at Mute. If he’s already done with his assault on Buffalo, LD can simply fling itself at her and attack directly in a rehash of its ‘No-Eyed Girl’ finisher (striking Mute or Atomic Bonsai repeatedly with its tendrils and teeth while holding onto her head, then finishing off with as much stand-acid as possible, as well as very likely snapping her neck in the process).

Buffalo’s sections of the opening moves are prioritized unless he’s managed to completely get out of our ranges, if doing both of any part of them winds up not doable.

Ideally, by this time, at least one of the two is defeated, double-ideally Buffalo. It’s possible that both of them are dead by now, in which case, good for us, but not guaranteed. If so, GG. If not…

"The intent of the Second Amendment is to prevent the federal government from disarming the state militias. It was never intended to limit individual states' ability to pass gun control. This is not unique to the 2nd amendment. None of the bill of rights was intended to apply to the states. The first amendment, second amendment, third amendment, and so on all originally applied just to the federal government. This meant, for example, that states could and did establish official state churches, despite the 1st amendment's ban on establishment of religion.

We think of the bill of rights as applying to the states today because of how courts interpret the 14th Amendment, which was enacted in 1868. The Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment says "" \[N\]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law ..."" Over the years, [courts have ""incorporated"" various parts of the Bill of Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights), concluding that a state violates the ""due process clause"" if it does something that the bill of rights prohibits for the federal government.

Incorporation is not universally accepted. For example, Clarence Thomas disagrees with incorporation so much that he says the [Constitution still allows states to establish official religions](https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/05/09/justice-clarence-thomas-and-the-church-of-virginia/). By that logic, states should still have the power to restrict guns as much as they want. To be clear, I think Clarence Thomas is wrong about the 14th Amendment. Plus for some reason he [thinks the 2nd Amendment should be incorporated against the states even though he thinks the 1st Amendment shouldn't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald_v._City_of_Chicago). ""Originalism"" sure leads to weird results.

Bottom line: if you want to know whether the Constitution restricts states' ability to pass certain gun control, don't look at the 2nd Amendment. Look at the 14th Amendment. I think there's a good argument that the 14th Amendment was intended to restrict the states' ability to limit gun ownership. In particular, the drafters of the 14th Amendment were concerned about the former Confederate states disarming their black citizenry.

That said, the drafters of the 14th Amendment were not fans of guns being used for armed resistance to the government. On the contrary, they had just fought a major civil war against people who claimed to be fighting the ""tyrannical"" (democratically-elected) Lincoln. The drafters saw gun rights as important for free blacks to use in protecting the elected government *against* ""rebels.""

If armed paramilitary groups overthrow the government in the future, I think it's more likely they will be trying to *impose* a tyrannical government. That is what has happened in the past. After the civil war, racist whites in black-majority states like South Carolina and Mississippi were very unhappy that democracy meant black people voting. The racists formed well-funded armed groups like the [White League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_League), which attacked the Louisiana state capital and seized the statehouse. These armed groups were successful in overthrowing the elected governments, both through direct violence and through voter intimidation that prevented blacks from voting. Once in power, they passed laws and constitutional amendments to prohibit blacks from voting. This ultimately produced nearly 100 years of further tyranny and oppression of blacks in the south. It lasted until the major federal civil rights legislation of the late 1960s."

"These are a few of the finds form recent weeks of yard sales and thrift stores. 

Peter Gabriel's first album is one I've been looking for but the prices I had seen in shops and online were a bit high for me. I found it for $5 at a thrift. A unique mixture of styles on that one. 

The Girlschool was a gamble. I had never listened to any of their stuff. The mix of punk and glam styles is good cooking music. 

Ozzy Osbourne's No Rest For The Wicked wasn't one of his overall best but still a good listen. Unfortunately, it doesn't contain my favorite Ozzy song, Hero, which is a hidden track on the CD.

The Metallica is probably my favorite find of the lot. It's an original silver Megaforce pressing with a nifty little Buy Independent sticker on the shrinkwap. 

Warrant's Dog Eat Dog...I really enjoy Warrant, call me names if it makes you feel better. Dog Eat Dog was their best album, I think. Dark and angry in places as opposed to the happy party style of their first two.

Trixter's self titled was a good album when I ran it in high school. I saw them live with Warrant and Firehouse at some point. This one is signed on the back as an added benefit.

Bryan Adams Waking Up The Neighbours is a really good listen. I bought it on a whim. I picked it up at a sale and put it back at first but returned to get it. I listed to th CD quite a bit when it came out and enjoyed it and had forgotten how much. There's some great guitar on it and if released today it could be considered country which says more about the state of country music today.

Helix just because I didn't already have any Helix. Cheesy stuff.

Pink Floyd's Momentary Lapse of Reason, to me, is definitive of the 90s. Learning To Fly and Dogs Of War got some heavy MTV rotation. It could be considered a David Gilmour album instead of a Pink Floyd.

Pink Floyd A Collection of Great Dance Songs, compilation, nothing special but couldn't leave a cheap Pink Floyd behind.

"So, two things. (Edit: I am saying this because OP is currently trying to hide from their ex and finding it’s not working for her, and obviously “move out” is the real solution here)

First, be the roommate you want to see in the world. Right now you’re both being avoidant, which leaves very little opportunity for deescalation/truce. Stop hiding from your own home. Make yourself hang out in the living room and play with the dog. Offer to pick up whatever for him when you’re at the grocery store. Don’t run for your bedroom if he sits down with you in the couch or dinner table.

Second, find some regular social activity outside the home to get you by, particularly if you’re planning on staying where you are now long-term. Even if you’re planning on moving back to your social support, make it a habit to get in some regular phone and/or texting time with friends and family so you have some way to vent and emotionally recharge."

"The most benign thing you can say about bdsm is that it’s supposed to be playful. It’s supposed to be experimenting with sensations and situations that are arousing, and an add on to your sexual experience.  
You don’t have this. It’s necessary for your sexual experience and it doesn’t sound playful. I think you’ve found a hack that side steps some huge issues with sex that you and your partner would both benefit from if you examined them. Therapy would certainly help you.   
One issue that is common in women is a desire to avoid taking responsibility for sex. It usually comes from a past or culture when admitting desire leads to punishment - mocking, rape or domination. It sounds like you’re trying to avoid taking any initiative and instead let your partner should responsibility for everything that happens. Being told what to do is a safe play for you and calms your panic. If my partner was like that though, I would feel like my partner maybe didn’t really want me. It’s nice to be wanted. Desire should flow freely between a couple, and then you can try out blindfolds and ice cubes. "

"Yes, you as an unknown driver to her did need the explanation regardless of whether you personally knew to always select the freshest milk product.  Her comment has nothing to do with you, personally.   There's almost always a valid reason for customers to go out of their way to comment because they probably have experience in the past in which a driver didn't know this and got milk that was scheduled to expire quickly.  Instacart doesn't let customers pick delivery drivers who they know can pick the freshest milk.  It's the luck of the draw.   So let me put it this way, would you rather have the comment or refund due to unsuitable selection?  She's trying to prevent the refund and the hassle.   

My solution is to rarely order fresh milk and use mostly powdered Nestle Nido from Amazon, unless I recognize the name of the driver to be one of the excellent 5 star ones who covers that store.  In that case, I use chat text to have the driver add the milk to the order."

If they all work out and we do have a logjam, we'll be winning a lot of games and no one will notice the trade for another prospect. Plekanec might be traded as a rental again. He fits so well as a 4th center right now. That leaves some room to manoevre at the deadline. Those one year contracts are a gift that keeps on giving.

As for prospects, young NHL players like Lehkonen and Hudon are way more valueble than risky prospects. Lehkonen, Armia, and Hudon are RFA next year, so of limited trade value."

Overall I would use the highest ilvl azerite pieces you have because of how much main stat you are getting from them and if you have a chance to choose one piece over another just think about how much worth the trait is going to give you for the content you are doing.

The people were still there; they just ""dodging the draft"" as it were.

I had not heard of that persecptive, what I had read was much older. I will have to read this to get the full story but, if the dearth of soliders is from a draft dodge, then why would there be a powerful movement for land reform?

"I see what you mean but it would be very difficult to merge the two. You would have a lot of gaps in your education and training. If you just took art classes, you would have the skill as an artist and maybe teach art, but you wouldn’t have the ability to adapt the materials into art therapy interventions required for the population you’re working with. To name a few examples: you wouldn’t know to use restrictive or fluid mediums with your client, you wouldn’t know how to use the expressive therapies continuum, and you wouldn’t be able to adapt materials on the fly. Art therapy isn’t just analyzing a piece of artwork. Honestly, that might be the least important thing in art therapy! It’s about the therapeutic process of creating art and what feelings, emotions, memories, frustrations, etc. emerge from that experience. You have to know how to use art to facilitate that discussion and honestly, art studio classes and counseling classes aren’t going to give you that knowledge. Art therapy programs don’t just have counseling and art classes and they shouldn’t. Visit [the American Art Therapy Association page](https://arttherapy.org/becoming-art-therapist/) that has specific information on the kind of classes you absolutely must have. 

Many states are trying their best to create legislation to recognize an art therapy license. If you practice as an art therapist without the masters, chances are, you’re going to get called out by the American Art Therapy Association. The reason why they do this is because a lot of people have been calling themselves art therapists without the education and training. This is unethical. And sadly, many other mental health fields don’t know this and I’ve heard of counselors that use “art therapy” in their practice and one of the ethical codes for counselors and art therapists is to not use techniques or interventions outside of your education and training. You wouldn’t be allowed as a counselor to use art therapy. You can probably use art in your sessions, but you would not be allowed to call it art therapy. Ethics is huge and if you don’t follow the ethical codes, you’ll have your licensed suspended; this is a huge reason why you shouldn’t merge the two. Just like any other mental health profession, you have to have the education, the training, the supervision, and a passing score on the national exam to be an art therapist. 

I don’t mean to discourage you. A masters degree is always going to be expensive no matter what field you go into. You do need to know that it’s not easy to be called an art therapist and do art therapy. Otherwise, we’d have a lot of crappy art therapists out there giving the profession a bad name. For online programs, your best bet is to take out student loans and look for scholarships through the American Art Therapy Association.

 I thought I was going crazy.
"Well, for example, at my school, there was one teacher known to frequent the same clubs the student usually visited, and as a result, they'd quite often run into them. Upon this, they would sometimes strike up conversation, occasionally dance with the students, and on at least one occasion, they did change clubs together with a group of students"

"Yes. If two units share the same in game speed after towers and leader skills, the unit picked ""first"" will go first. For example, in GW the unit on the leftmost side will go first.

"Your care needs to be fixed quite a bit, especially with diet.

You need to get rid of the reptisoil and replace with a far more proper substrate like tile, paper towels or non adhesive shelf liner. If you want to use a loose substrate I'd suggest going with bioactive but it requires a lot of research and space, it can also be really expensive. It can also still be really risky to do.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as lighting goes you need to get a proper UVB tube light, mercury vapor bulbs are great as a backup bulb, secondary UVB source or a portable basking light but should never be used as the main UVB source. They dont provide a proper UVB graident,and it can be very hard to control temps and UVB exposure, for instance the basking spot gets too hot and you move the bulb up, but then the UVB levels decrease.

I'd suggest getting a Reptisun T5 HO 10.0 or a Arcadia T5 HO 12-14% UVB bulb and a reflective fixture for it, a 34"" would be ideal since you'll need to upgrade the tank eventually to a 4x2x2. Replace the UVB bulb every 6-12 months.

If you want you can still use the MVB for heating.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto the diet, 12 insects a day isn't very good, for an adult it would be fine but for a sub-adult, juvenile and baby they need a lot more insects. 30-60 a day at the very least.

You should stop feeding him lettuce and spinach, these are terrible choices and can even harm him. I'd suggest collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens and endive. Greens should be offered daily.

&amp;#x200B;

This feeding guide should help out.

Feed as many as the beardie will eat in a 10-15 minute time frame each feeding.

1-4 months eat 3x a day.

4-12 months eat 2x a day.

12-20 months eat once a day.

20+ months eat at least twice a week and then every other day at the most.

&amp;#x200B;

Babies need their diet to consist of 70% insects and 20% veggies, meanwhile adults only need 10-20% insects and 70-80% greens

&amp;#x200B;

Staple feeders - Crickets, locusts, grasshoppers, silkworms, black soldier fly larvae, dubia roaches, turkish roaches.

Treat feeders - Waxworms, hornworms, superworms, mealworms, butterworms.

&amp;#x200B;

Wax worms - once a week, 4-5 max.

Hornworms - every other day to every two days, 4-6 max.

Mealworms - every other day to every two days, 5-10 max. Only for beardies above 6 months.

Superworms - once or twice a week, 3-4 max. Only for beardies above 12 months.

Butterworms - once or twice a week, 3-4 max.

&amp;#x200B;

Daily greens- Turnip/collard/mustard greens, endive, and then kale if added to a mixture of the other staple greens mentioned.

Fruit once or twice a week - Banana, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, red raspberries.

You want two supplements at the very least, a calcium and a multivitamin.

Generally, beardies below two years need calcium 5x a week and multivitamins 2x a week.

However, beardies above two years or at two years of age need calcium only 2-4x a week with multivitamins 1-2x a week.

This does however depend on how your adult beardie is with diet, health, just laid eggs, is laying eggs, etc."

"&gt; Though, interestingly enough, it would also generate a uniform gravitational field on either side of the sheet: The gravitational acceleration would not drop off at all with an increase in distance.

Wait what the fuck. This doesn't make any sense. If we take any small bit of the sheet dA and consider the force of dA on a point h from the plane, then as h increases the force of dA decreases. This is true for any part of the sheet, so it seem that the acceleration must be strictly decreasing as h increases, or the acceleration must be infinite.

I can follow the mathematical derivation [here](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath530/kmath530.htm), but I can't reconcile that with the above. What am I missing?

EDIT: Okay, I think what I'm missing is that as h increases, the component of force towards the wall increases for the parts of the wall that are further away, even as the total force from that part of the wall decreases (slightly). This offsets the loss of force from the parts of the wall directly underneath the point."

Thus we had a class of people without education, under the rule of brutal dictators.    The only forces available to fight were Islamist extremists with a poor understanding of even the religion let alone liberal democracy.     

So yes, the middle east is our fault.   The border crisis is our fault also.   We've essentially installed violent cartels by refusing to change drug policy for 40+ years.

"Well the way it works over here is that you need to have your Gun license and permit to acquire to get most semiauto guns, even during private purchases and every firearm that you acquire has to be registered to you and every firearm that you sell has to be reported. And if you sell your legal firearm to someone without a license or a permit to acquire you are as much of a criminal as the person buying firearm illegaly. Plus all firearms must be presented every time you are renewing your license (every 5-10 years). I understand that would never fly in the USA. But me personally, I think the system works quite well. But then again, since gun deaths aren't really an issue, there are no political points to be scored based on that platform, so we don't have any (relevant) politicians who would run on that. Hell, our Social Democratic party is generally in favour of stronger gun rights."

#[When He Died](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2D9B4qV4vg) (vs Mute Alone)

Mute may lack a lot of outright offensive ability, especially when compared directly to us, but nobody who has ever underestimated her has come out of it alive. Destiny and Damon will not assume that they’ve won simply because the greater threat is erased. That said, they can relax slightly now that the absolute worst of their threats is done for.

Mute shrinking down is all-around a net positive for her. After a certain point (read: only shrinking a little bit wouldn’t be enough; she would have to be “like mouse-sized”) she can completely negate the effects of RtH just by shrinking herself down enough, which also means disappearing into a crowd is all the easier. As fond of bright loud colors as she is, even at this size, she would be easy for Destiny or Damon to pick out in an open place, so she would either have to go into a store or hide among said crowds in order to do this. On top of the fact that the huge fire will agitate these people, if not force them to run away in terror entirely, making being stepped on feasible, there is a much more troublesome threat on the horizon.

Destiny will put his surgical mask on to cover up his breath-holes and signal for Damon to stay behind him. One of them will then call out, “Mute! Show yourself in five seconds, so these people don’t need to be involved!”

If she does comply, it’ll be easy for RtH to switch places with her, and effectively their kill technique from the opening can be replicated more or less.

If she doesn’t comply, LD will spit out, in rapid alteration, in something of a “spread,” bleach and ammonia, creating a lethal chlorine gas. At her smaller size, this will kill her faster than it will any civilians.

If she tries hiding in a building with no people, not only do Destiny and Damon not have to enter to do this, they won’t give her a warning.

Should she survive these, Destiny and Damon can wait. There’s increasingly few safe avenues to approach them from, and they control the arena.

#[Kids With Guns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCkFSe3voRc) (vs Buffalo Alone)

This is less desirable than the previous, but still manageable. He has way more tools for long-range trouble, so if he’s managed to escape alive from our tricks and tribulations, let alone in fighting condition, that means trouble.

First things first, Damon and Destiny and their stands will very very liberally apply their wax paper to all sides of the duck fountain. Buffalo being alive and Mute being dead means there’s no reason to set the thing ablaze, so instead, Destiny will always have THT on him, held by LD’s tendrils. Due to its indestructibility, it’ll actually function very nicely as a shield for the more fragile stand.

Buffalo will need to go all over the place in search of food for his jojolity, unable to camp in a single hard-to-parse location, and the wild man running all over the place stealing food will certainly be noticed by the neutral crowds of people. Thus, we’ll be able to have a running tally for quite awhile of his exact location, which Damon can teleport towards, person by person, while Destiny makes as much of a scene as possible, picking up party cups by the Kitchen Collection and loudly declaring “free wine tasting at the duck pond!” (he’ll obviously either move Mute somewhere out of sight or melt her down and *then* do that. A lot of places like skeletons as a Halloween decoration, and ‘tis the season). While he’s doing that, making himself an obvious target, the more normally-dressed Damon is getting closer and closer to his location. LD can shield itself, and ideally Destiny himself, using THT. 

There’s a nonzero chance that this defeats Destiny, but with all the ways that Buffalo stands out, Damon will be able to handily get the drop on the hunter. Buffalo is at a disadvantage at close range, after all.

If he chooses to snipe from atop a building, Damon can easily either climb it too or stand-hop it and, either way, use RtH to swap places with Buffalo, prompting him to have a nasty enhanced-gravity fall, which Damon and RtH can then follow up on.

If Buffalo manages to secure fruits from an Oasis he’s created, as long as Damon is present, two of those are countered almost directly.

“Stuck in the Middle,” as well as “Atom Tan” would be capable of proving themselves dangerous traps, were it not for RtH. Since Buffalo must activate Atom Tan like a frag grenade, and Stuck by damaging its skin, it’s safe to assume that he would be in RtH’s range to swap were Damon caught in either, trapping Buffalo instead. If Destiny is caught, the same process may be employed, but with the added step of Damon swapping into the danger zones in his place before forcing Buffalo in. If Buffalo doesn’t directly go for an oasis’ products, meanwhile, Destiny or Damon themselves could weaponize Atom Tan and Stuck, chucking them with their stands’ considerable might to make mobility harder for Buffalo.

“Scar Tissue,” meanwhile, can simply be pawned off on any civvie passing by by Damon, while LD has enough destructive power to destroy the constructs outright and could free him in that way.

#[I Earn My Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E280s6NpdYg) (The Extended 2v2)

Of course, we aren’t necessarily taking it for granted that we’ll manage to defeat one of the two right off the bat, so on top of incorporating appropriate elements from the solo opponent strats, we will have to consider more things further from what the pair could do as, well, a duo.

Most of the things applicable for Mute’s solo strategy, as well as elements of Buffalo’s, apply here. Destiny will still be drawing attention and using THT as a shield, and they’ll wax paper the hell out of the Duck Fountain, as well as whichever koi pond Buffalo doesn’t get closer to early on (A/N: not much we can do about it, but semi-predicting Buffalo might eat the koi from a pond he tries to shoot dry), but it won’t be as blatant nor as much ‘hey I’m live bait,’ what with two people to deal with. He has to seek Mute out, after all.

All of Buffalo’s fruits, in one way or another, become much more dangerous here. Mute can shrink down Atom Tan and Stuck, at no cost to their output, and growing Scar Tissue makes it function the same, but bigger. That said, we’re the ones who can actually see Scar Tissue, and when it’s bigger, it’s likelier that civilians will end up hurt by it instead of us.

As for Atom Tan and Stuck, the biggest practical application I can see for this is an attempt at a surprise attack on Destiny and/or Damon, possibly also just giving Mute more oomph when shrunken down in an attempt to ambush us. So basically, we’ll have to omit the warning from the chlorine gas strategy, and possibly mix in some gas+fires for good measure; that way we can disrupt them within Mute’s person and make them more likely to backfire on her than ever be used on us.

Destiny and Damon will generally stick close while Mute is still in the mix unless a good opportunity to target Buffalo comes along, and if she does manage to get the drop on them, see the contingency below.

The chlorine gas can also be used to force restaurants and food stands and the like to shut down, limiting the places Buffalo can choose to eat. If caught up-close by Lemon Demon by any chance, he’ll also have a similar kill-move to Destiny’s attempt at the opening play used on him, with or without a respectable-sized body of water to make it more theatrical.

#[Error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofyGLVXotYI) (Contingencies)

*What if Mute gets close with Buffalo bombs anyway?*

Destiny will shield his ally with his own body from her attacks, especially if bombs are involved. He’ll use LD to hold her close so she’s caught in the explosions too (and gains some extra damage from being so severely injured by LD and its liquids), while he himself holds The Hanging Tree close as a shield, meaning that, while Destiny takes a lot of damage, survivability is still more feasible than it is for the more wounded, smaller, less durable opponent who tried to sneak up on him and now got a very unhealthy dose of stand-acid. From there, with or without Destiny, Damon will be able to take on Buffalo more or less the same. The lack of live bait for Buffalo is only a minor setback to a plan that, by design, focuses more on Damon’s abilities.

*What if Mute shrinks Buffalo down so he can have more viable sniper spots?*

Then he’ll be susceptible both to being smoked or gassed out as well, just as Mute shrinking herself down would be. This’ll also become a nonissue when Mute is dead, and in the event that both of them survive our opening moves, she’s the one we prioritize taking out first. If anything, it’ll backfire when he’s sprung back to normal size in some situation that a grown man would be stuck or injured in but a shrunken one was A-OK in.

*What if Mute and/or Buffalo get bigger, instead of smaller?*

Then there would be a certain point where they’re unable to be RtH’d, for sure, but that’s really not anything resembling a deal-breaker. It makes them a much easier target for Lemon Demon and its assorted attacks"

"Yes, we should all be appalled at Judge Kavanaugh's tribulations. While America cries a river over unimportant maladies like sexual assault trauma, HIV and childhood lead poisoning we ignore the one disease that threatens our society more than any other. Affluenza.

Affluenza is an illness that affects our best and hardest working citizens. Scientists already know that affluenza is caused by a deficit of privilege. But a cure has yet to be found. Great philanthropists like Koch, Murdoch and Adleson have led the way in search of a cure. But they can't do it alone. If our government spent half the money researching affluneza that they waste on healthcare for the poor (who will never be anything but lazy and useless no matter how healthy they are) we could find a way to restore the lost privilege of affluenza sufferers and cure the illness once and for all."

"Kayn's passive is just an absolute mess. It's a really cool concept, but the execution is so bad it actually blows my mind.
 
Orbs are worth an obscure amount of progress, that gets higher as the game progress. Alright, cool idea. But that brings me to the part that I can't wrap my head around: Why try to hide the fact that it's basically a timer?

It is a timer, just hidden behind a billion of weird things to make you think that the whole Kayn mini-game matters. You could be afk for the first minutes and get your transformation almost at the same it as you would have normally just because early orbs are pretty much worthless and late orbs are each worth an absurd amount of progression.

They just wanted to make a cool looking thing, which is great, but it ends up hiding so much of the information just so players don't realize it's really just a time gated mini-quest. Kayn can't earn his transformation too early no matter what but still can't go too long without it, the game takes pity and basically give it anyway. It's a timer without being one.

They could keep the exact same numbers and balance and just make it a real timer that goes down when you collect orbs more and more as time goes on and it would be the same, but clearer. I'm ok with making things look cool, but not at the price of having to make the UI omit important stuff on purpose..."

Relying on the numbers is much wiser than relying on the residents' emotional response to perceived criticism.

If you're staying alert at night, keeping valuables out of sight, and locking doors, you are indeed living in fear. Fear of attackers, robbers, and intruders. If you didn't fear them, you wouldn't take those actions. I don't worry about those things very much at all where I live.

"The question really is how he plays it.

I don't think he could try to play it seriously and expect that people would take him seriously. He's spent too many years as Boris Johnson. His buffoonery has shielded him from all the hard questions, but has also excluded him from the hard questions. His actions have grabbed attention, but also led people to believe he's an idiot. And so to play it seriously would be to slip off the mask and reveal the Tory underneath.

His best bet, I think, is to pull a Trump kind of campaign. And that's great, as long as there are people who think he's telling it how it is, and as long as there are people who think that somehow Boris is talking about the situations that they recognise. And then he wants to lure the opposition into campaigning negatively against him, rather than saying ""Hang on a minute, you're lying here, and here's what really needs to happen"". And he needs a grand vision. In an election against a vision, you have to have a vision.

Also, the event of Johson being PM will be good for Labour.  Because it will realistically be dud to any of the few conclusions to Brexit, and will have repercussions for the Tories. And in the event of a general election, Labour's infighting will just disappear. The spotlight will be on the loyalists, and on the leadership, rather than the rebel factions, who know better than to risk their seat in the election. 

The only event I can see Johnson winning is if he promises no deal as an election promise, and somehow there is the majority for that option. "

One house had rusted out rear gutters full of leaves, soil and grass because beyond not cleaning the gutters (nobody expects tenants to clean them) nobody even cared to notify the property manager and their inspections didn't pick it up.

Aside from what people would tell you on here, the demographic of renters still skews towards the young, the precariously employed and the poor. Most people are in that group at some stage of their life, but if you think that demographic look after a property on average the same as the fully employed, experienced home owners you are having a lend of yourself."

so let me make one up.

hey, this is an experiment to test how quickly women can run on average vs men. we'll record you running as fast as you can over the course of a few days and average out your numbers.

day one goes smoothly.

second day the test subject is left in a room. a staged incident happens outside the room. like an attacker on the loose or something. someone enters the room and tells her to run because there's an active shooter or some shit. then she sprints the hell out there. record how quickly she ran.

then compare how quickly she ran the first day with how quickly she ran the second day."

It is a little suspicious I'll give you that but there's not a whole lot of evidence to it and again most of his record is saintly clean, his record as a judge, his reputation, his massive amount of character witnesses. It doesn't seem that suspicious and he had six investigations on him that turned up nothing to support any accusation. The drinking stuff was nonsense, he said he drank a little bit then suddenly he's accused of being black out drunk and being an alcoholic with a handful of character witnesses against hundreds of character witnesses. To me this seems like something that would warrant a small investigation, which it did as part of it and found nothing from my understanding. Initially I just looked at the results and shrugged it off as irrelevant because nothing came of it. Now I'm informed on what exactly happened with that and it seems like nothing, a possibility but you'll find some possible event happened if you look close enough at anybody and he went through 6 investigations so I don't see any reason to hold onto it unless new information comes forward. **Shrugs**"

Anyway, guess he pivots off his first metatarsal pretty hard, and these shoes are not exactly cheap. I don't want to go budget, I'm happy to spend $100 on sneaks if they're stylish and could last a year (or until he grows).

Any advice in general? I don't want to get him boots because he's still growing, so a GYW or leather sole won't be appropriate. Thanks in advance!"

"No amount of pure logic will convince nonbelievers, because it is a heart problem.  They are fools who wont acknowledge God because of their wicked heart, not because of their mind.

“Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.”
‭‭Romans‬ ‭1:19-21‬ ‭KJV‬

“He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.”
‭‭John‬ ‭3:18-20‬ ‭KJV‬‬

What you must do is appeal to the law of God written on all of our hearts, show them that they are a wicked sinner in need of a Savior.  If they will humble themselves and acknowledge this and turn to God, they will no longer be blinded.  If they will not humble themselves, they will remain blind.

“For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)”

"Makes sense to me that's the main oil focus.  That *is* where the oil is.  The finer points of soft-rock methodology are something I know I'm missing.  Gaining a useful knowledge base in energy exploration is no doubt a lifetime process, and I hope to work on acquiring it for many years.

Programming is, as you say, a tool.  However, I don't think that it's a tool that should be denigrated (yes, calling it arcane is denigrating it).  It's the flip-side to the ""things missing from knowledge base"" that you're bringing up.  The us-and-them mentality is silly.  It's obvious even from the outside.  Programming is a tool in the toolbox that should be considered right alongside all the others.

Ideally the soft-rock jockeys who have heroically memorized the bumps on a particular microfossil shell and the computer nerds who know how to usefully apply a particular language/methodology *could be the same people*.  Wouldn't that be weird?  Instead, we get an initial (predictable) passive-aggressive ""just telling it like it is"" and ""the dang young people"" approach.  I get it.  I enjoy unfiltered honesty.

Unfortunately, I also believe that everyone believes them self to be the reasonable centrist so it's really no use talking to anyone because they all believe that their party is the more fair and unbiased party.  


If there really was any hint of a party that catered to the millions in the center, that party would have beaten Hillary AND trumph combined. Unfortunately politics has become so fuckin partisan the last 2 decades that there's no hint of rationality on either side now."

"My mom did this. During the divorce she took half the pension, half the 401k. Never worked a day in her life. Oh and also 350,000 in cash. Left my dad financially ruined. She blew through all of that in 4 years. Complained to us about how there wasn’t enough money and we were going to lose the house.

I saw all the financial paperwork years after reconnecting with my father. He was giving her $3500 a month child support (more than I make after taxes with a finance degree). 

She’s been mooching off some dude until my dad can pull his pension/401 without penalties. 

This is the court system people. This is even AFTER she was arrested for assault/battery throwing a wine glass at my dads face. 

Not to mention, the breadwinner pays for the lawyers. That was another 120 grand he had no say in.... "

"I'm not changing the rules, the EU has started the process to suspend the voting rights of both Poland and Hungary. These are facts. Many a career politician and legal expert studied the situations before the progress was triggered for either country, yet it was. The problem is that the EU doesn't have the means to enforce her rules. Poland protects Hungary and vice versa, nothing will happen to either of them as they break treaty obligations. All of us would be happier if we didn't share a union with people so alien to us that they vote their way to dictatorships and that in good times, without war or economic turmoil. Yet there is no way to expel states once they are members, they can only leave of their own volition. 

I think the ultimate solution will be defacto expulsion from all decision making centers, as the euro core countries will band together more and organize themselves into new decision making bodies for the core that excludes the authoritarian Easterners. It's called the EU fast track or some such. I also expect that the Poles and Hungarians, or at least the illiberal ruling parties will be excluded from EU parliamentary groups. It would be a lot better if they would just leave though."

"I’m aware that it’s “more common than you’d think.” I myself am a former self-harmer, and as a teacher I see way more self-harm than I’d like to. But it being common doesn’t mean it’s not a big deal. It doesn’t mean the person doing it doesn’t need help, and love, and care. I agree that using self-harm to manipulate his girlfriend is bad behavior, and she should probably take a step back from him, but it’s also a cry for help.

And. Even if he is not actually hurting himself - but wants you to think he is - it means that something is wrong. It’s not the best way to go about getting attention, but for someone desperate, it’s all they know how to do. He deserves help. If you “go with it until he grows out of it” - well, he might not, and things might get a whole lot worse.

"From what I can tell, the gist of your argument is “the status quo is bad so we all need to do more, do **something**, because colonialism was terrible and we all have an obligation to deal with the fact that we are all continuing the colonizer tradition. We can do start by ~listening~ and putting ourselves in the shoes of the victims of colonialism”

But that this doesn’t mean we need to feel guilty

And it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be here.

And it doesn’t really mean anything tangible or substantial beyond symbolic gestures and dressup and maybe the occasional bite of bannock and a smudging or two.

But somehow, by doing it, things will improve to the extent that one day we won’t have to be constantly reminded of how we are beneficiaries of genocide.

Many of the young women are the victims of human traffiking and held against their will in dorms by the surrogacy agencies, even ones that outwardly appear legitimate.

"Here's the thing-- if you don't vote (which is a choice), you're accused of cowardice, capitulation, or allowing evil men to make decisions for good men (paraphrasing the quote badly). 

On the other side, if you vote 3rd party for a candidate whose platform falls more in line with Catholicism, you're told that you gave the vote to the ""opponent"" (depending on the Catholic zeitgeist), or you're refusing to fully participate in the democratic process.

"It's a shame that it had to get to that point for you to realise you don't want kids, but at least now you know. And I hate to say this but if your family can't support you over this then you're better off looking elsewhere for help, so finding that therapist is a good idea.

Your husband's departure is one thing, but your family should support you through anything, and if their limit is abortion then that's their issue and does not reflect on you."
"My family is very similar. I've realized I needed to block them on phone and email for a while so I can work on myself. They can still reach me through others if absolutely necessary, but at least I don't have to hear the intensity directly from them now, and I think they're more cautious about what they say and their emotional demands of me when others are watching. It hurts to have to do it, but I had asked them repeatedly to talk to a therapist about the list of things that were going wrong, and the only ""therapist"" they wanted was me doing their emotional labor for them. Anyway, the break from all of it has been hugely helpful to my mental health. I hope you find something that works for you too."

"Non-citizens could be defined as a national group. Also, they do have a right to trial, under article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is also reinforced by article 9, which bans arbitrary detention and reiterates the right to trial. The Convention of Rights of the Child also reinforces this, saying that children should only ever be detained as a last resort, and for the shortest possible time.

Basically, these camps are a massive fuck you to international human rights law. They may not be death camps, but they ARE concentration camps, and the kids not being citizens has absolutely no bearing on the legality of the situation."

"&gt;[concentration camp noun: A camp where persons (such as prisoners of war, political prisoners, or refugees) are detained or confined](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/concentration%20camp)

-

But to get more specific:

&gt;[Persons are placed in such camps often on the basis of identification with a particular ethnic or political group rather than as individuals and without benefit either of indictment or fair trial. ](https://www.britannica.com/topic/concentration-camp)

[Immigrant toddlers ordered to appear in court alone](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/06/27/immigrant-children-deportation-court/739205002/)

[Kids in exchange for deportation: Detained migrants say they were told they could get kids back on way out of U.S.](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/06/24/kids-exchange-deportation-migrants-claim-they-were-promised-they-could/)

And still: [Most deported migrants were not asked about leaving children behind, Trump official says](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/25/deported-migrants-leaving-children-behind-712088)

&gt;The Trump administration failed to document consent in most such cases, an administration official told POLITICO. That lapse increased the number of departed parents whom officials must now find and contact about whether they wish to be reunited with their children, and, if so, figure out the logistics of how to bring them together

Toddlers on trial without representation, parents told by ICE agents they will only get their kids back if the agree to be deported, and most parents not even being asked if they want to be reunited with their kids did not get a 'fair trial'. 

Though, to be fair:

&gt;Concentration camps are to be distinguished from prisons interning persons lawfully convicted of civil crimes.... They are also to be distinguished from refugee camps or detention and relocation centres for the temporary accommodation of large numbers of displaced persons.

The family detention centers are not concentration camps. And perhaps it's unfair to call the tent camp in Texas a concentration camp, since they are constructing buildings that will 'house' the kids once they are completed. So they are in the process of building concentration camps that may be completed at some point, but for now kids are being concentrated in makeshift facilities while the government tries to figure out what happened to their parents.

We can argue about whether the kids were 'displaced' by their parents because they either asked for asylum or came into the country illegally, or by law enforcement officials who wrongfully took the kids away from the parents without consent(and at times even without the parents knowledge of what was happening), and often without the option to reunite. (edit: But I don't think we will be able to change each others views of this issue.)"

"No problem! It’s a tough scenario, don’t try to beat yourself up. 

A lot of people think male and female friendships are black and white, with no grey in between. Especially if one of them is married. There’s no harm in letting your mind wander a little bit. Indulge in the fantasy; but just don’t get lost like I did. Unrequited love is a lonely place and just opens you up to comparing potential guys to this one, a contest they always seem to fail. If I was waiting for what I thought was imminent divorce, well, we are at 9yrs and still no divorce. 

What this taught me personally is that the spark doesn’t have to always end with intimacy. There will always be someone you will find interest in. The spark that I thought would end in love ended up making us very strong friends in the end; I feel like he’s a big brother to me and my romantic feelings have vanished. After a lot of emotional work, rationalizing and harsh criticism from my friends. And dating men who are a way better fit! There’s no reason why you can’t be friends but draw a line in the sand and make sure it is built on honesty. Most of my friends are men, who have long term partners. Having your own absolute (I will never be the “other woman”) keeps it from ever growing into something more, and not indulging in outings that could be misconstrued as a date. Being friends with their spouse especially! If I like them, chances are I will like their wife/girlfriend. 

Right now the danger is him setting you up for an easy ego stroke, especially if he is complimenting you; talking about “what if’s” if he were single. Which is something that never happened with my friend and I. It’s the beginning of a one ended relationship and you could be left in the dark. Keep him at an arms length and enjoy the relationship you two can responsibly have. "

"I actually quite like Frances! I think Paul and Mary were tough on everyone that season (remember the showstopper where they made everyone cry?) but especially Frances. I think that her flavors wouldn't have been criticized nearly so much if her bakes didn't look as good as they did. We notice deficiencies more when they're put next to that person's really strong qualities. 

The issue with that final was that they were given a very short amount of time to do a wedding cake. Professionals sometimes spend multiple days on them! I thought that Frances did a good job with her minimalist look, while Kimberley's looked a little sloppy, especially with the stamped layer. Similar to Paul's criticism of Ruby's wedding cake, I think Kim's lacked overall unity from tier to tier. Kimberley was one of my favorites that season, but with a technical that no one really did well on plus her leaky pie in the first round, I do think Frances was the rightful winner.  

Also, it's worth looking at Frances's ""completed"" version of her final bake where she wasn't under a time crunch:

"A) more than 1/2 of dental patient visits are for hygiene. There are a number of money generating services hygienists provide. Dentists want hygienists to do cleanings to free their time for more difficult and costly services. 
B) hygienists need to be licensed by the state. They must graduate from an accredited school and take a fairly difficult course schedule. So they need to take pre-requisite courses, apply, get admitted, spend money and a few years of education before they can practice. This makes the job worth more money.

"I was about 5 years old. I was looking at earrings on a rack as my parents checked out at a store in the mall. I showed my mom a pair to tell her how pretty they were and she didnt pay attention. I showed her another pair that I thought was ugly and she didnt pay attention. As I put them back, I accidentally knocked a few down and thought I'd put them all back.

About 30 minutes later, as we were in another store, i dropped my little basket and out came the ugly pair of earrings. They had fallen in without me noticing and my parents immediately accused me of stealing them. My mom said ""I KNOW she stole them because she was telling me how pretty they were!"" Because I denied it, they called me a liar and dragged me back to the shop, made me apologize to the cashier, and told me that the next time I stole they'd call the police to take me away. I remember it all as clear as day, down to how ugly the earrings were.

Ever since then, for my whole life, they never believed anything I said, citing that incident. My brothers took advantage of that and called me a liar any time they wanted to get me in trouble or when I told my parents they were beating me up. They even told other parents about it in front of me. Well into my adulthood, they STILL cite that as the day they knew I was a liar and the amount of suffering and injustice I went through growing up was immeasurable. I have PTSD from the way my one brother beat me. All he had to do to get away with it was call me a liar. My parents paid so little attention that they didnt seem to notice the wind knocked out of me or my bruises. Claimed I was faking because, after all, I was a liar. My dad beat us anyway, so theres that.

Now that I'm an adult, I embarrassed them both by recapping the incident from my own point of view. I have new credibility, albeit too late. They swore that they had done what any parent would do, but I told them that no kid should be branded a liar for lying once as a toddler ANYWAY. It was worse than the beatings themselves to know that, no matter how right or desperate for help you are, your words will never mean anything, especially to those who are supposed to protect you."

I don’t know how to do the spoiler hiding on mobile so I’ll just say that the VERY interesting piece of info we learned in the F&amp;B excerpt has convinced me once and for all that the show have taken pains to avoid spoiling aspects of George’s books.

Everything from the Pink Letter and Jon’s resurrection to how the Wall comes down and Jon’s real name, I believe the show have actively avoided ruining these reveals for George by going their own way. "

"Runeslayer strikes me as a class that's okay at doing a lot of things and fails to do most any of them well. In the hands of a grid that brings its own MA to the table (Atma, Primal, etc.) it can do what you want, when you want, it well enough. If you don't have a grid or a weapon that could do that, you'd going to be struggling to get full effect out of this class outside of the CCW. It needs a great deal of ougi generation to get the specific buffs / debuffs / effects out. 

The big, glaring key-point is that it is a very, very slow class. It'll do what you want with it eventually, but every time I've done so, I thought to myself: Most any other class I can imagine does what I'm doing better, more consistently, and with less hassle. Elemental Defense down? Elysian. MA up? Elysian, Berserker, Asparas. Nuke? Nighthound. I'm typically okay with this because Asparas is my favorite class and it falls under the same train of thought. The difference feels like a time investment vs. cooldowns. With most classes, you're getting payout immediately. With Runeslayer, you're sitting on a slow-burning engine. CCW speeds this up immensely, but the gameplay of the class just feels so tragically slow for what it's trying to do, which is EVERYTHING.

Note, I really liked Ninja when I was more fresh to the game. I was hitting hard and single-attacking didn't bother me much at all. Deep as I am into HL, it just doesn't pay off for what I want it to do. It has some interesting gimmicks to it, but it boils down to being too much of a hassle to use over anything else. "

"You like Huey Lewis and the News? Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this; Fore!,( https://youtu.be/bYQ9a0crgAI ) their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip To Be Square"". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself."

"Of course. A new GnR album would be just for the fans. Everyone knows that.

It won't be in some unique way of course. Maybe do a collab with Kanye and Rihanna ? I'm being sarcastic, and yes, I'm coming for you Paul McCartney. 😂

However, hey, I hear that Lana del Rey might have a thing for Axl.  I'm kinda genuinely  interested in what a Lana/Guns might sound like. It might work out into being  a bizarrely interesting ballad! 

Anyway, it would be cool if Axl can do a collab with older folks like Iggy Pop (considering Slash worked with him before)."

"It's being realistic. The cop knows they aren't going to back up their threats - they also don't generally prosecute people for yelling drunken threats.

"Well, thats difficult to answer, because it depends on a lot of personal variables. How much disposable income you have, how much time you are going to be outside, what you will be doing outside, what you want to wear under the parka for work/school, etc.

For me personally the answer is a clear yes. The Superior down (along with the other parkas in this range like the LL Bean or the Lands end) will be significantly warmer, more water/weather proof etc.

The Eddie Bauer is a good choice, but personally I like more &amp; bigger pockets (for storing hats/gloves/etc), and the high handwarmer pockets were not good for my arm length. But YMMV on both of those points. Eddie Bauer also has very regular deep sales. Don't buy it at the list price. (Which also makes your question easier to answer, since the difference is less than 100 really)

Really the only advantage the Uniqlo has is that it has a full snorkel hood, which can eliminate the need to wear scarves, masks, or possibly hats, but its insulation and weather proofness are noticeably worse. .  

The longer you are going to be spending outdoors, the more value the warmer coats will be. So if you are spending 30 min waiting for the train/bus/walking every day, or shoveling a driveway Get the warmer one. 

If you are just spending 5 min getting to your car or a cab then you can more likely get away with the uniqlo. 

If you need to wear business casual clothes at work (or want to wear similar weight stuff at school/work) then go warmer, because you are more likely to have to layer a heavier sweater or fleece under the uniqlo. On the other hand if you are going to be wearing sweaters or fleeces anyway, then it doesn't matter as much. 

A new parka I just found out about is the Lands End Rusk, which is supposedly even warmer than their expedition, and only $249 (and they regularly have 40% off sales or more, its currently 174), which if the $100 is a big deal for you might be a nice way to split the difference between price.   

I'm actively waiting for my local stores to get in their parkas, I'm lucky to have almost every major parka available in town (except ironically, the Uniqlo).  The 4 I am deciding between are :

* the Lands end Rusk 249
* Lands end expedition 300
* LL Bean Baxter State 300
* LL Bean Main Mountain  400

But all of them can be found between 25-50% off between now and Black Friday. Lands end has a sale almost every other week it seems.

"""Brutal,"" James muttered to himself as he trudged up the stairs to his third-floor apartment. He knew his roommate Terry wasn't home since he'd just seen him on Live TV filming from the town square. It was watching that program that James had recognized that Terry was Defendron, leader of the Legion of Heroes, when they had defeated yet another pathetic loser who tried to blow up a bridge and called himself a villain and the whole thing had been captured by the news. 

""What a stupid place to not cover up, buy some makeup, dude."" James laughed derisively at the opening Defendron's costume had between his ear and shoulder, revealing the fairly faded remnants of the hickey Terry had been wandering around with for a few days.  
Any single other person living in their town would have likely been thrilled to recognize his own roommate was a superhero; a guy he knew well, played videogames with, and went out drinking with on occasion.   
But James *wasn't* just anyone else. He was a villain himself and though he had never been *thwarted* by Defendron, he had encountered him and of course knew who the hero was.

James sat on the living room couch for what seemed like hours with the TV playing the news on repeat quietly in the background, resting his forehead in his hands. Though he had been hoping for a sliver of doubt, now that he recognized that bruise he couldn't unsee it.

""How am I gonna be able to afford this apartment?"" His job as a fill in IT guy at a nearby law firm gave him incredibly flexible hours and fair enough money, but not enough to afford this apartment and keep living as he was. He would have to stop all of his extracurriculars.   
As he looked around the room he stopped his eyes on anything that belonged to Terry. ""No more stereo... There goes the big TV, gonna have to bring out my 27' from the bedroom... Gonna have to buy a whole new dining set..."" Despair started to creep over him. ""Every other roommate I had was so messy too, and didn't clean up after themselves. Ugh, soggy towels on the bathroom floor. Terry cleans up after himself and does the cooking like half the time."" Just last night Terry had made them steak and salads and the steak was cooked to perfection. They had cleaned the kitchen together even.  
Every roommate before Terry had been an absolute slob: leaving plates lying around, mooching off James' dinners, refusing to clean up after themselves and then waiving away a desire to pay for a maid. Absolute stark-raving lunacy.  


This apartment had been an expensive investment, right in the heart of downtown. It had thrilled James to be so close to his 'day job' and also be able to do most of his villainy without having to drive too far to the city. ""Certainly couldn't do that from the Suburbs..."" a whine was starting to creep into his voice as he thought about everything he would be losing. He walked to his closet and slid open the secret panel to reveal his own costume; that of the villain Doctor Chaos, arch nemesis to Defendron, the only villain to get away on more than one occasion.  
And Doctor Chaos wasn't the type to rob banks; blow it up - **sure**,  but even if he *was*, that would be money for villainy, not for paying for your mundane house. Plus what if they tracked the bills or something? He threw himself backwards onto his bed with a thump and a sigh.  


""On the other hand, it would give me an advantage over Defendron if I knew who his family was, where he was at any given time, *and* I could still let Terry live here..."" He thought it over for a moment, then sat bolt upright. ""Its brilliant really!"" James stood and twirled around a bit, sliding the secret compartment closed again. 

&amp;#x200B;

The jingle of keys three times in the door was the agreed upon signal between them. They both always opened the door like that, just in case the other had someone over. 

""How was your night?""  James asked as Terry hauled a load of groceries onto the kitchen counter. James immediately set about helping him put them away."

"The Godswoods were interesting, in a region as old as the Stormlands he imagined that once over a thousand weirwood trees stood as tall and strong as the Durrandons. The gods trees still existed, but they were hardly the same. The Grassy Vale had it's own woods, but they were different.

""Garbage code"" is definitely *not* the only place incompatibilities arise.

Even if you think the example in my other comment (I'm not your parent) is garbage, which I'd disagree about if you think beyond just that very specific example... do you use [designated initializers](https://godbolt.org/z/DbIgaO)?

"While I can look at your points and think, “that’s not an unreasonable thought process”, here are my thoughts:

I think the third down call after the two minute warning could have been better. It’s a third and 6, with that call you are banking on a kicker who already missed one kick today. 

Seattle’s run defense is strong enough that we were not getting six yards on that play. So the only real benefits to running are: 

- forcing SEA to use their final timeout
- setting the ball on the preferred hash for the kicker. 

Ideal scenario with the run call is the above two items, and we take a 3 point lead. Seattle still has almost two full minutes to move down the field and tie the game. With the aerial attacks of today, that is so much time for the other team, ESPECIALLY Russel Wilson. 

So even if the call worked and we take the lead, Seattle still has too much time to kick a field goal and send it to OT. If we went for a pass play, it is possible that it would have been incomplete and we go for the kick anyways, and it is still possible we miss it. But, the payoff could have been a fresh set of downs and a closer FG, and more time taken off. 

I think the offensive minds of today (Pedersen, McVay) call a pass there and try to win the game instead of putting it on the other team to lose it. "

"Really? They don’t have a prefrontal cortex. I’m not advocating for the murder of animals, but putting them at the same intellectual level of humans makes no sense. 

Now, if you want to argue that according to your own scale of values, animals and humans are equal, I have no qualm with that and think that it’s an honest opinion. Like, if you want to argue that animal lives are just as valuable as human lives because that’s what you believe in, that’s fine. But claiming that the chickens who are (in terrible conditions and shouldn’t be) tortured by the meat producing industry, experience their captivity in the same depth and dimensions of humans who are capable of complex thoughts and emotions then I don’t believe that is true. 

I tried to search for a peer reviewed publication that would clarify whether or not farming animals experience existential dread in particular, but I found nothing on PubMed, so I can concede that my argument is not scientifically well supported. However my PERSONAL OPINION still stands, I guess. Animals shouldn’t be treated badly, and what the meat industry is doing is appalling, regardless of the animal’s level of understanding of it, because humans are capable of empathizing with the suffering of other beings, and to be honest, cruelty in animal farming should be outlawed and people should lower their meat consumption because it’s killing the planet BUT comparing that with one of the biggest genocides does not sit well with me and never will.

"I agree.  Whether those women actually consented or not, nobody except those women themselves know.  The women who came forward clearly did not.  There obviously are going to be women who ARE flattered that a celebrity is playing grab-ass or grab-pussy in this case.  Hell, if certain male celebrities came up behind me and smacked my ass, I'd be all up for it.  Obviously that isn't the appropriate way to greet someone, but there are people who don't mind it.    In Trump's little tape, the women he was referencing were people like me who WOULD be flattered depending on who was doing the grabbing.  That certainly isn't a greenlight to do that to every woman he meets (which he seems likely to attempt if they're up to his beauty standards).  

I feel like this tape just gets blown way out of proportion as if it's some kryptonite that it clearly isn't.  Trump was talking with a close friend and bragging.  He was likely embellishing his prowess and appeal as he is wont to do.  Locker room talk is an apt description.  He's talking big and blowing smoke up his buddy's ass about how much game he has.  Does this excuse his language and what he said?  Absolutely not.  It gives it context that the average person can relate to.  Not in the actual subject matter being discussed, but just the nature of the conversation itself.  

That right there is the key that many people don't seem to get.  We can all get up on our moral high horses about how crude and vile his comments were.  That does nothing when the average person hears this along with knowing the context and thinks, ""This is like when Tom was going on about his sexual conquests,"" or, ""You know what?  That sounds like when Karen is talking about how much of a cougar she is when 'pouncing' on these young guys.""  That is what a lot of people chalk that up to.  Continuing, 2 years later, to make a huge deal out of this comment when that has proven not to work for the last 2 years is just foolishness.  No amount of, ""But NORMAL don't speak that way,"" is going to sway people.  We learned that from the ""deplorables"" comment.  All it does is simply push people in the middle to vote R out of spite.  

That, in a nutshell, is what spurred my original comment.  ""Grab 'em by the pussy,"" is basically the Democrat's version of the Republican's, ""... But her e-mails!""  "

"&gt; I'm an idiot for working so hard and your lazy co-workers are not stupid, they are just doing what they should be doing.
&gt; I'm not a manger and I tried to manage people and I'm wrong for that.

Depends on what you mean by manage people. Yelling at people who take a week to do a one line font change really isn't management. At best, it's project management. It's important to note that leadership takes many forms, and a manager who only relies on role power by yelling at people is going to have poor results.

&gt; Whether your co-workers are doing anything at all, is not your business. If they are slacking and you have to pick up their work. Don't try to do it quickly, it'll make them look bad and make you look like a smart ass.

At some level, employee productivity is tied to wages -- employees earning more wages than the company makes is a recipe for a dead company in the long term. Not that it's a perfect 1:1 correlation, or even close, but it is a necessary condition. So from a Kantian perspective, the situation may be untenable -- if everyone behaves the same way, you're likely all going to be unemployed. And based on your team description I'm not surprised the wages are low. You may be unable to negotiate your way into the higher paying position you seek, in the end.

If for some reason, you want to stay where you are, you should tilt your thinking 90 degrees. Yelling at your coworkers is unlikely to make them better programmers. How *can* you make your colleagues just a little more productive? You're not a manager but there's an opportunity here for some leadership from below. One idea: remote pair programming sessions.

The general idea is that you have a shared screen both of you can work on, while on a voice conferencing system. Typically one person ""drives"" while the other is studying the code and thinking about high level things. The goals here are increased focus for both parties, and knowledge sharing. In your case it may be more asymmetrical, but you should definitely let folks drive at their own pace, and [practice keeping your temper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa9DLxDtPtc).

As an exercise in soft power / leadership, you'll likely have to pitch this to the team and recruit, since it takes two to play. While management probably likes the 'keeping people focused' bit, you should focus on things like knowledge sharing, debugging sessions, rubber ducking and such. If someone suggests they're having a problem, volunteer to help them out. Start small, one or two hours tops -- it's exhausting for both parties since you have to code and communicate.

From your point of view, you want to be demoing behaviors you want your peers to emulate. Testing strategies, commit frequency, code quality, timeliness, documentation, stackoverflow, etc. And you when your peers are driving you want to be mostly positive. Perhaps there's a thing or two you can pick up from them, even if it's just how to use features in a code editor you're not familiar with.

Worst case scenario, you have more practice explaining how software development works to those less experienced than yourself, never a bad skill to hone."

-	learn to pass ball well. Different types of kicks to get the ball where you want it to go. Short passes, far passes, on the ground, in the air, etc

"It doesn't make sense that India fund **all** elements harmful to Pakistan, that's just Pakistani multi-generational consanguineous marriage level retarded.

The Taliban are India's historic enemies and have  committed terror attacks against India, including in Kashmir and they are opposed to the highly pro-Indian government in power in Afghanistan presently. If they gain power in either Afghanistan or Pakistan it damages Indian interests due to the Taliban's love for international Jihad. If they gain power they will eventually attack India via Kashmir if and when they get the chance, they are already attacking Indian targets within Afghanistan.

Plus the Taliban has a long historical relationship with the Pakistani intelligence community and the two were mutually sympathetic, and might be again once the US is out of the picture.

Pakistan is lobbying for the US to hold talks with the Taliban instead of military action, and India is asking for military action against them. The ISI wants to reinstall the Taliban - so why would India want to strengthen them?

On the international front India actively lobbies the UN to help weaken the Taliban:

India asks UNSC to stop Taliban's funding - [https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-slams-un-security-council-for-failing-to-cripple-taliban-s-drug-trade/story-LRh35E8v0soSSPiBrVphrN.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-slams-un-security-council-for-failing-to-cripple-taliban-s-drug-trade/story-LRh35E8v0soSSPiBrVphrN.html)

India: ""No good or bad taliban"" - [https://thediplomat.com/2017/11/india-and-the-afghan-taliban/](https://thediplomat.com/2017/11/india-and-the-afghan-taliban/)

Taliban helps Pakistani terrorists carry out terror attack against Indians [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian\_Airlines\_Flight\_814](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Airlines_Flight_814)

Basically, the current government in Afghanistan is India's ally and it would do everything to strengthen them rather than uncontrollable islamist militias, and all the evidence suggests that is exactly what they are doing.

Balochistan on the other hand is a ethno-nationalist movement and will never attack India because it has no shared border with it."

If I'm not mistaken, before he disappeared, he was headed for a feud with Eddie since lying/cheating/stealing was wrong.

Hey ! 

Reposting this since I got late on the last Weekly Critique :

&amp;#x200B;

I've joined Bumble 2 weeks ago or so, I need some feedback on my profile :  [**https://i.imgur.com/1tnJ08s.png**](https://i.imgur.com/1tnJ08s.png) 

It's in French, here is the translation :

I'm looking for the half I've lost during ancient times, when two souls were just one. Can you help me find it ?

* \+10 luck if you show some interest
* \+an infinity of memes.

Now, I know I don't show a lot of things about myself, I thought  about that ""RPG-quest style"" that I found funny, original enough to  stand out from the regular profiles.  This is not perfect, I'm aware of it, but I'm really looking for  something original and funny ;)

Thanks !

"Yeah, it's mind-blogging to me as well that you see this as clearly worse.

&gt;In that case, I'd say that the GOP and DNC are both guilty of doing this.

No. We already diverge here. From my perspective, calling this ""delaying a senate vote"" is equivocation that tries to bridge together two inherently different types of actions. The difference between them is clear as daylight. The Democrats are powerless to actually delay anything; they're using public pressure. The Republicans *prevented* (not delayed!) the President and the full Senate from carrying out the process mandated by the Constitution, one of the most important processes that underlie separation of powers. The separation of powers, checks and balances - that's the stuff of American democracy. That is *the core*.

Note how crucial to my case it is that in the Garland case the Republicans prevented a vote rather than voted against the candidate. The Republicans had a majority, and if they blocked Garland with a vote, I would have literally zero objections. That would not be subverting a process. They subverted the process by preventing the vote. They didn't *try to prevent a vote by making it costly in terms of PR*, as the Democrats are trying to do now. It's the difference between ""you have a right to do X, but I'm going to tell everyone you're a terrible person if you do X"" and ""I'm preventing you from doing X by bodily force"". Do you really, really not see how the latter is much worse? 

Look. Imagine that it's two years in the future, Trump is polling really badly pre-election, and someone finds an obscure Senate rule that allows the Senate to declare a state of national emergency for 3 months, delaying elections, and then renew it by simple majority indefinitely. Imagine that Mitch McConnell declares that the Senate will do this ""in the interest of healing a country torn up by a divisive election campaign"" until ""our democracy is served adequately by both candidates having a fighting chance"" or some bullshit like that. Such a hypothetical action *is in the same ballpark* as what they did in the Garland case (if obviously of a greater magnitude). Violating the balance in the separation of powers for naked partisan gain. Subverting the democratic process using a procedural trick. And you're telling me that merely flinging sleaze around at one person (however innocent they might be) is worse. The McCarthy era hearings didn't subvert the democratic process. The Clinton impeachment hearings didn't subvert the democratic process (and they did throw Lewinsky under the bus, coincidentally). I don't know how to make it plainer than that.

"&gt; Lightoller had plenty of women around when he was launching early boats half empty, and on later boats he did put men on when there weren't enough women nearby. So if there was order confusion it didn't really matter.

Lightoller only let in one male passenger (male crew members were allowed on to man the boat) and that was Arthur Godrfrey Peuchen who was allowed to climb down a rope on a boat that was already half lowered because it was felt that there wasn't enough able seamen on the lifeboat.

First things first, which iPhone is it? Have you unlocked it?  

Sprint iPhones are great because CDMA iPhones have GSM and LTE bands in them. Unlocking it which should cost you nothing will allow you to use it on almost any carrier. 

Your best bets are going to be either a straight talk style carrier (boost would also qualify) or a prepaid option from a main carrier.

I haven’t looked recently but in the past att and sprint both had pretty cheap prepaid services that offered unlimited data."

"If I'm reading your post correctly and you're saying you'd effectively only work one day out of five, that's time theft. I'm not saying everyone has to be 100% productive for 8 hours a day, salary or hourly, but if you're only working 8 hours of a 40 hour week you're basically stealing from the company, which is 100% grounds for termination with cause.

If I knew my coworkers were slacking to that extent I'd be requesting a meeting with my manager and expecting them to do something about it, and if they didn't have an explanation for why it was taking so long for them to complete tasks, or didn't care, or gave me shit about it I'd be looking for a new job.

OP, if you're reading this and you do end up looking for a new job, you *do not* want to say you're looking for a new gig because your coworkers at your current job are lazy. You want to tell your next employer that you're looking for new challenges, or to step up to the next level or something along those lines. Keep it positive and about *you*, otherwise if you just come across as bitching about your current employer that may sink your chances of landing a new gig elsewhere."
"I recently took a break from my [Every Street in Manhattan](https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCbike/comments/9cpto9/every_street_in_manhattan_parts_nine_and_ten/) project to fulfill a years-long dream of mine -- to bike the Erie Canal from Buffalo to Albany, approximately 410 miles with some detours. I had done Utica to Albany in years past, but this is my first tour longer than 2/3 days. I had to rethink everything I've done before. This is my first trip with panniers. Previously, I'd done everything out of a backpack. I always swore I'd never install a rack or a kick stand, and yet, here we are. The whole trip was excellent. The weather was mostly ideal. The paths are mostly well-maintained and more sections are being paved every year. I'm looking forward to doing this again in 10 - 15 years when the whole length of it is paved."

"Hyperdrive in [Known Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known_Space). Not so much for anything inherently interesting about it, but one of the limitations stated is that ships disappear when they try to engage the hyperdrive too close to gravity wells.

"I don't know what your neighborhood is like, but the only reason I was skinny as a kid was because I had friends around to ride bikes with everywhere.  Granted this was the 90s and I don't know if kids are still allowed to rome around the neighborhoods everywhere without their parents watching.

I know this is true because as soon as I got into computers and then later got a car, I blew up.  Had to figure all that out on my own.  Realized for the most part my parents were always cooking healthy meals, but when i could go drive to fast food on top of dinner I was ruined.

College made me realize I was sad and fat.  If you get your kid into something fun now, or hell, make him realize he doesn't want to be sad and fat I think it could help."

"I was just thinking about how underpowered Harry is, and while he's not very impressive, or creative with his spells/charms, he regularly pulls off magical feats that usually kill or seriously harm lesser magicians, manifesting a corporeal patronus is stated several times to be a year 7 charm, and advanced magic even for that (he uses it on his N.E.W.T.) he's also trained in legillimency by Snape, remember, he had Voldemort's unwavering confidence, Harry fought Snape's legillimens effectively, multiple times, as an amateur, even countering once. Snape wasn't impressed, but he was also trying to train Harry to have impregnable thoughts, it was in his interest to appear unimpressed to extract higher performance from him, further, he basically trains a paramilitary wing of the student body, who then form an effective resistance against Voldemort's army 2 years later. TL;DR Harry is pretty OP, Rowling just keeps it understated by constantly having Harry in the company of types like Dumbledore, or combating advanced wizards like Voldemort, Snape, etc."

"Even in Judaism they are still treated as property. The laws are for the most part secular, however.

Arab-Israelis, which Bedouin are (and some opt to serve in the military as well) often more closely adhere to their cultural norms in their communities where Jewish/secular doesn't necessarily stem. If just because it is impossible to police every single Arab community at the rate it would be needed.

So you need to take defter touches, such as through education to see reform within the following generations. 

And you can tell they want this education. At Abu Kaf they built the high school well before their village even had a functioning road and direct water supply despite being next to the highway. 

They had just begun to build it when I began.

So, it's difficult for me to say if they do or do not have rights. It depends on the tribe, the family, and to a degree the woman and how consigned they are to their life. I met quite a few fighters. Hearing the girls talk about how they intended to become doctors, and a lot wanted to be the first Bedouin Prime Minister tells me that they still treat themselves very much individually.

They are not willing to acquiesce, to put it simply. At their heart they are fighters, and they fight for what they want.

I took your statement to be more general. I think all cultures have their respective issues, but frankly many cultures need to be updated, so to speak, in this modern world.

I do not believe in preserving something simple for the sake of it, be it animals, cultures, etc.

For example, I look forward to the Dead Sea being drained completely, and desalinated as much as possible. It's basically a pool of death. But I also look forward to seeing the Sahara converted to grassland as well.

In short, I don't think history and culture should impede progress for a population or the individual."

I believe first mover definitely gives them an advantage in the space. It's very hard to create a sound marketing strategy that challenges Tesla and they are even rolling out infrastructure that supports their vehicle. Most other companies are simply concepts without any product in the market place.

"I despise the modern GOP much in the same way I despise the great authoritarians of recent history. 

They use fear, repetitive propaganda with laser precision, and manipulate existing structures just enough for their minority views to dominate our discourse. 

With that said, people on the Left underplay the Right's true genius. Trump is a fucking moron. Bush 2 is a fucking moron. But the operatives behind both of them are evil geniuses. 

They have convinced millions of poor people that ultra rich billionaires (Trump TBD) have their best interests at heart. And they did this by using incredibly effective and targeted propaganda  to develop single or wedge issues (abortion, gun control, mah free speech) that have zero bearing on the economic, political, or social health of the United States.

I didn't mean to insinuate that one poor meal choice was indicative of an entire lifestyle. I apologize to anyone if that's how I came across. I'm not a dietitian, but have consulted with many, and work with them in my field. I think it's also equally disingenuous to assert that a raw vegan diet (not one I follow) is more restrictive/less healthy/more damaging than fast food, high sugar, high fat and highly processed diets are. We don't know exactly what their macro or micro nutrient consumption and breakdown is. However one could likely assume they are likely consuming a much more nutrient dense diet in general. 

I think the key is balance (as I've said many times), whilst acknowledging that we all often could consider better options for ours and our babies health and well-being.

&gt; Although Republicans have defended Kavanaugh by saying that the alleged assaults happened long ago so there&amp;#039;s no way the incidents could be remembered clearly, Comey insists that&amp;#039;s far from the truth.

"Yeah, absolutely. A possible scenario is that Trump doesn't consider Swetnick's allegations credible and is preventing her claims from being investigated. It's also possible that the FBI will be ordered to investigate Swetnick's allegations without questioning her, which would be absurd.

If the Avenatti case is not included because the White House has artificially limited it out I would be opposed to that and continuing with the nomination. If I was a senator in that case I would vote no.

Besides, of the three stories Swetnick's has the most obvious holes. I don't believe her case is going to hold up and I would like the FBI to clear that up. If it can be found she's lying she should be brought to justice. If she's telling the truth it's obviously disqualifying for Kavanaugh, for the supreme court and any other court.

At this point we just don't know. I would guess that Swetnick and Avenatti will go full media soon and the FBI will eventually investigate before the week is done.

Wrapping something in a class is nice.  When you wrap a noun, verb or adjective in a class, and have a category of nouns, verbs of adjectivrs, suddenly you can write sentences.

That kind of category of classes lets you create insanely more intricate structure without insane amounts of complexity driving you insane."

"&gt; I noticed a significant difference, not with the high percentage chance, but with low percentage chances. 

Ah, the low and high percentage hit rates have different formulas. Basically, FE6-13 lie about low hit rates the same way they do about high hit rates, meaning that when FE7 tells you the hit rate is 30% it's actually 20%. Fates kept lying about high hit rates - albeit to a very slightly lesser extent - but it stopped lying about low hit rates. That means a 32% hit rate in Fates is literally 32% hit rate.

&gt; When it gives the enemy a 32% chance or so, it hits half the time, from my experience. That doesn't make logical sense, at least to me. In FE7, 32% hits would happen, sure, but never enough to bet on it. I would never be afraid of an enemy that had a 32% hit chance on me, but in Fates, I have to hold my breath, which is ridiculous to me.

This is all in your head. A 32% hit rate in Fates does not hit half the time, it hits 32% of the time. This is more than it would hit in FE7, sure, but not by anywhere near as much as you're thinking.

Basically, humans are bad at estimating probabilities because we only notice when things don't go the way they're expecting. When a 32% misses you don't think about it, because you were expecting it to miss. When it hits, however, you get mad, because you weren't expecting it to hit. Thus people end up thinking the RNG is broken and unfair when, in reality, it isn't. 

This is actually why Fire Emblem started lying about hit rates in the first place: people assume that a 90% is really a 100% and get angry when it misses, so they tweaked the formulas so that a 90% *is* basically a 100%.

&gt;On top of that, I have never in my life gotten as many critical hits as I have in Fates than I ever did in FE7. I was in the arena with Hinata, and he had a 7% critical chance, which is respectable. What doesn't make sense is how he hit 3 criticals in a row, and killed the enemy. 

Displayed crit is actual crit in every game in the series. A 7% is always a 7%.

You say that what happened doesn't make sense, when in actuality what happened is just unlikely. And it would be equally unlikely in FE7.

Let me give you an example. Suppose you flip a coin ten times, and get tails every time. That's pretty unlikely: roughly one in a thousand. But suppose you don't flip the coin just ten times, you flip it several THOUSAND times. Then the odds of getting a streak like those tailses is no longer that unlikely, because the low chance-per-flip is compensated for by the large number of flips.

When you play Fire Emblem, the RNG is going to generate a number literally thousands of times. Thus, the odds actually favor the possibility that, at some point, something really crazy and unlikely is going to happen to you. As I mentioned earlier, those are the things that are going to stand out in your memory. You're not going to remember all the times that low crit chances didn't lead to crits, but you're absolutely going to remember the times they did.

Your takeaway from this shouldn't be ""Fates RNG is fucked and unfair,"" because in reality the probabilities are always equal to (for low rates) or better than (for high rates) what they say they are. Several thousand people kept careful track of their results and combined the data, so this has been experimentally verified. Your takeaway should simply be that sometimes you get unlucky, and that a 32% will rarely feel to a human like a 32% even when it is."

"Hey, what I've learned so far is this is most definitely what you make it. My advice to you is:

Sign up for classes as soon as you can, boss. I was late so I have to deal with spaced out and some late night classes. Get your financial aid in order asap too.

If you haven't got the habit already, make a journal. My recommendation is a half lined, half blank moleskin journal. It will keep your due dates and stuff organized. Since you only have a class twice a week, there are little to no reminders for due dates.

Finally, join student organizations for like minded friends, and make friends with your hall mates. It's basically a free group of friends. I usually love my alone time but I've been a way better social person now.

Overall dude, it's great. If you're like me, you've got the mindset that it's like a doorway to a new lifestyle but it's less that and more just a phase change. I dunno, hard to describe, but my point is, it's not a drastic thing. You'll get accommodated and everything should be natural.

"There's a running theory about foot fetishism that connects it to breasts. Runs off the assumption that if people can be attracted to non-sex organs, it might be visual stimuli that some people subconsciously pick up on. Namely curves.

Typical parts of the body that are considered sexual are usually curvier than the rest. Breasts, butts, genitalia. Sometimes other parts just get lumped in. Feet, armpits, ears, noses. "

"Once again fall is upon us and with the colder weather returning, this beef stew is the perfect way to warm yourself up. The options for this are truly endless, but I like this served over some cauliflower rice for an excellent meal. This also makes a ton, so it will make many lunches (and honestly, gets even better after a day or to). 

Also note – radishes when cooked in this way do NOT taste like radishes, but more like potatoes. They are a really stellar addition to this dish.

**INGREDIENTS**

* 2 tbps avocado oil
* 1 medium onion (diced)
* 1 lb shitake mushrooms
* 15 radishes (halved)
* 3 carrots (chopped)
* 2lb stew beef
* 1 6oz can tomato paste
* 4 cups beef stock
* 2 bay leaves
* Salt and Pepper to taste
* 1/2 tsp xanthan gum

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan (I used a dutch oven), add diced onion, some salt and cook until translucent.
1. Add garlic, and mushrooms cook until fragrant.
1. Add the cubed beef and brown on all sides.
1. Next, mix in the radishes, carrots, tomato paste, beef stock, and bay leaves.
1. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 2-4 hours until the meat is tender.
1. Sprinkle Xantham gum (option, but makes a nice thick sauce) and let cook another 15-20 minutes until thickened.

"Toyota was removed from the latest Wangan Midnight revision in the Arcades in Japan and GT has had relatively little Toyota cars compared to PCARS 2 (Which while not Japan made. Bandai Namco published it globally. Suzuka seemed like they damaged relations enough that they couldn't solve that issue for PCARS 2), so not even Japanese games are safe. It sounds like a company issue and not a ""Xenophobia"" issue (C'mon people. Toyota's been a huge global concern since the 70's). I've seen some car blogs and forums point to decreasing car sales and younger people being way more interested in older models that don't make money compared to Toyota's newer line up which is why they have suddenly pulled from all sorts of younger skewing media including video games. Which is like, super dumb for their brand.   

I can't remember the exact interview but when a Ford rep was asked about why they were going big into Forza 6 with the GT as the cover car. They explained games are a great way to build badge loyalty and they make sure to get the entry level models in players hands globally so they can build attachment, and they also know older people with a bit more income play the game. So even when something is out of affordable range. There's still a model that's attractive. It's kind of an extension of when they were asked why they still stay in Stock Car racing. They don't sell a lot of Fusions. But they sell a lot of F-150 trucks based on it. And considering how prominent the F-150 is in Forza now (Including a ""Hero Car"" spot on the FH3 box art with the Lambo Centenario), it's a model they see targeted at the same people who play these games. 

Why Toyota isn't telling licensors that they can have the old models if they put that 300hp Camry and the Tundra in (Along with the new Corolla and the Yaris WRC car which is even sponsored by Microsoft) is kinda mind boggling when they could take that new Corolla, which is apparently going to be their new attempt at a younger market. And offer it with the older cars. Build a badge attachment like other companies do instead of just settling for an Econobox Soccer mom market while others like Mazda and Nissan are still building brand loyalty with the badge (Though if I were Mazda, I'd have a word on why the Mazda 3 didn't make the cut for the FH4 base game as its a popular model in the UK. Hopefully it shows up as a Forzathon car)

Also why you know there was a crapton of SUV's in Forza 7. Car Companies know people with purchasing power play these games and McLaren even sold a P1 after it was revealed on stage for Forza 5. There was a very famous effect on the sales of Nissan cars because of the original Gran Turismo where they couldn't ship Skyline GT-R's into Europe fast enough to meet demand and Honda allegedly paid a not insignificant amount of money to make sure the first car a player bought in Gran Turismo 5 and 6 was a Honda Fit. But I suppose, that's Toyota's prerogative. If they don't want to make people interested in the new Supra by offering both it and the older model in as many games as possible. That's on them.      "

Play him on turn 4, next turn your at 6 so you can play de la fille, or tenko and father punishment. Heaven has one of the stronger late games out of the other classes, so in general you will be accelerating yourself into where you want to be faster than normal.

You're talking about two completely separate statistics.  Are you talking about gun violence, or are you talking about homicide rates?

&gt;Racism is a serious issue in most developed nations, but it's not usually so severe as to be measured in the number of minorities shot by police in dubious circumstances, which again pushes the US outside the norms for developed nations.

Usually I like to start off with something simple to test the temperature. You can compliment her shoes. Maybe she's wearing some t-shirt with a name of a band/tv show/sports team/club. You can ask some contextual questions, why are you both there at that exact time? 

I like your shoes. Go Team! Are you a runner? Play soccer? I love that show! OMG this line is so long!

Then if you get a mild response, you can do quick follow up questions. Which school you go to? How long have you been doing X? What you think of the season finale? Where did you get that X? Oh Really? What about Y? How did you like X compared to Y?

You should be gauging the responses with this small talk banter. A smile, eye-contact, eagerness, and counter-questions are sure signs that you can go into deeper waters. Do more banter, then when you run out of things to talk about, and she  seems like she's into it, you can introduce yourself, ask for her name yada yada ""Hey it was really nice talking to you, you want to meet up/go get  some lunch/dinner/coffee later/right now?"" Exchange phone numbers. Offer Make plans via texts/in person for further contact. 

Its crucial to separate girls that chat with you out of politeness, and those that might be interested. Eitherway if they seem to be eager to go back to their routine/in a hurry, generally act pretty cold, or imply something about their relationship, its not worth pursuing.

"It makes me think of medieval inheritance law tbh. One of the problems with gavelkind is that the constant splitting up of land/money results in basically all your descendants becoming serfs within a couple of generations. Meanwhile Primogeniture results in the wealth staying in the family, but you better groom your heir for managing that wealth properly lest he lose it through bad investments. Of course if you only had one child with gavelkind and that went on through generations, well yes that intergenerational wealth could skyrocket, but life has a tendency to throw all sorts of wrenches into plans like that.

I personally don't plan on having any children. There's enough people on this planet as it is haha. And yes just knowing that the wealth is almost guaranteed to dissipate just reinforces that tbh. I wouldn't want any of my descendants to suffer the pleb/serf-life and there's just no 100% way to make sure it doesn't happen."

"Obligatory late to this so it will probably get buried but it’s truly the most unfair thing I’ve ever seen or probably will see in my life. 

My best friend was raised by a single mom and his older sister. His father was never in his life growing up so they were very poor and could never afford a lot of the nice things that myself and others in our church (where we met) had. While we all had cars, nice clothes, and cool electronics in HS he never really had any of that. 

Less than 6 months after we graduated his sister, who was two years older, was coming back from a road trip and was killed in a car accident at only 20 years old. The devastation he surely endured is something I don’t even think I can fathom nor want to. He was never the same after that. Him and his mom were all each other had after that and he spent years never be able to hold down a job, dealing with health issues (diabetes), and always needing to borrow money. I always helped him as much as I could and even though sometimes it would take him months he would always pay me back. 

A few years ago his mom met a nice man who was pretty well off and they got married. For the first time in his life he finally started getting opportunities that I had always had. His step dad bought him a car, he was able to get into school, and found a nice girl that he started dating and eventually moved to California with. Things seemed to finally be trending in the right direction for him after years of struggles and depression. 

Two years ago he was on his way back to Texas from California to settle a legal issue he was dealing with from a previous arrest for a tiny amount of marijuana he had from a few years prior. I spoke with him on October 7, 2016 and he said he was in New Mexico riding his motorcycle almost back to Texas. The next day I woke up to a Facebook post from his mom that he had been involved in a fatal accident somewhere not too far from the border and that was that. 

Now his mom is alone. Both her babies killed in motorcycle accidents. She still has her husband and his kids thank God, but that can’t be much consolation for her. She died September 13, 2003 and his anniversary is this week. This last month has to be the most difficult of times for her to endure and it pains me deeply to know how unfair it is that she has to go through this every year for the rest of her life. Ironically, she actually text me today. I’m gonna text her back now to tell her how I love her. And I will let her know how I think about him every day, especially  this time of year cause it coincides with the start of the Spurs season which we were both huge fans of. 

Mark, I love you buddy. I hope you and Jocelyn are out there somewhere reunited waiting for Mimi to come join you. Until then, I’ll make sure to always be there for her here while y’all wait. "

"First off: bruh. Exactly NONE of the horrible, dehumanizing, evil things she and her friends did to you was your fault. They CHOSE to be rapists. They chose to sexually assault you. You did not choose to be assaulted. Likewise, you are NOT responsible for her sobriety in any way. A huge step towards healing from the trauma of abuse and rape is allowing yourself to place the blame where it really belongs.

Seek out a therapist or trauma counselor. You deserve peace and healing.

Second: I don't know enough trans women to say whether or not rapists are as prevalent among them as they are among cis men, but the fact is that there are a terrifying number of sexual predators out there, and the majority of them are AMAB. Predators often show red flags before they attack. Pay attention to how she acts regarding your identity and boundaries, how she treats classically undervalued workers like wait staff, cashiers, &amp; janitors, how she demonstrably regards the boundaries of other people. If you meet somewhere, make a safety call to someone you trust. Take a page out of cis women's book and have a friend ready to call you so you can fake an emergency if you need to leave ASAP &amp; don't feel safe just walking away. If she even jokingly disregards your boundaries, ditch her. If berates service workers, ditch her. If she talks about an ex who ""went crazy,"" ditch her. There are 7.5 billion people in the world. You don't have to hang your hopes on any given one you just met. Your safety is far more important."

"I think med schools adcoms need to do a much shrewder job of analyzing the path to medicine. A guy who realized he wanted to be an MD/DO after being a psych counselor for three years is not the same as someone who got into med school at 22 after wanting to be a doctor since they were 15. 

I feel like you could do a much better job of picking out the people who are doing it for themselves, not for others, by being much more realistic about motivations. The 22-year-old did not decide they wanted to do medicine after they first volunteered in the hospital as a freshman in college--they were volunteering because they wanted to do medicine.

"&gt; people were complaining about a random encounter with wolves during the first ""world map"" scene. I had no problem with that wolf encounter at all on Normal difficulty, so I'm assuming that people were just playing on a harder difficulty and then complaining that the harder difficulty is, well, hard.

I agree with most of your post but the thing about that first random encounter on Hard isn't that it's hard, it's just nearly impossible and requires absurd luck. 

Your party and setup doesn't really matter, their AC is too high, if you leave crits on they crit for 26+, and they continuously land their Trip on you. So not only do you miss literally 90%+ of your attacks, they're knocking you down and one-shotting your tanks the majority of the time. You essentially need perfect rolls just so your attacks hit while simultaneously hoping the enemy has bad rolls and don't one shot everyone.

There's hard and then there's just imbalanced and I think most people that have tried Hard, even people experienced with the PnP version, would agree that it's poorly balanced and RNG dependent in the early stages of the game.

I understand that you can modify the rules and make it manageable, but why is Hard a difficulty when it's actually ""spam reload your game until you get multiple lucky rolls in a row"". There's nothing hard about RNG, it's simply luck."

"This isn't a criminal trial. He's not going to be found innocent or guilty. This is vetting for a job. This is what's wrong with all the republican hysteria. He's not on trial. There's no ""innocent until proven guilty"" because no one is trying to hold him accountable for guilt. This is all just due process to vet a nominee for a job. That's it. Not getting a job is not a punishment. That's just entitled bullshit. I've not gotten plenty of jobs I wanted. At no point did I think I was being punished.

The FBI will reveal the results of their investigation. I will be happy that an investigation has been done rather than concealing any potential for truth. Failure to investigate would mean a failure of democracy, as vetting is part of the process to approve nominees which an elected senate votes to confirm.

I do not support Kavanaugh after reviewing his record. My disapproval is higher after seeing all the lies and misdirection in his testimony.

If evidence is found that exonerates him and he is confirmed, I willl still disapprove. But I will be happy that we have followed the proper process. I will be happy that we have given an elected senate a chance to make an informed decision. I will be happy that democracy didn't fail, even if I disagree with the outcome democracy lead to."

"As I replied elsewhere:

I'm not a diehard football fan like some on here. Maybe that makes me a bad fan, or less than some of you guys. I dunno, whatever.

I don't try to live vicariously though the conference. I use it to give the whole sport some meaning. It is a lens that provides relevance to every game, even to games that don't affect my team directly."

"Many things you do require some disk access, regardless of whether the OS is ""done loading"" or not. If you open Windows Explorer, the state of your drives needs to be checked so capacity info can be displayed, icons have to be loaded, etc. Changes happen, and everything can't just have an updated cache in memory all the time.

These small disk reads are usually very fast, but right after startup, many other applications are loading, of which the OS has no means of determining when they'll be done, or even *if* they're done.

A typical mechanical hard-drive will struggle under these conditions as the read head bounces back and forth between different locations. Access time for each read becomes a major problem, thus causing noticeable lag time between your actions, and a response from whatever application you're trying to use.

The OS could theoretically wait until the rate of disk access is below a certain threshold, but there could be conditions where the disk is never idle. What if some third party anti-virus software decides to scan at startup? You could be locked out of your OS for hours, with no indication of why, or when you'll be able to get in."

"You should not worry unless your are engaging in illegal activity. Many [military personnel use Tor](https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en) around the world. For example: in combat zones, military personnel use Tor to transmit and receive military intelligence and to connect with family members back home. Hostile combat forces wanting to identify, locate, harm, or kill opposing military forces cannot determine the IP address or the location of the initiator (if using a Tor [pluggable transport](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en#PluggableTransports)) or the respondent. In the United States, many people working in the armed forces, Pentagon, NSA, DIA, CIA, etc. use Tor to help protect themselves and their families from hostile domestic and foreign adversaries wanting to compromise or harm them. Your military recruiter or someone in his or her family might be a Tor user."

"Are you really a lawyer? Do you forget that this whole mess started with you calling me ignorant in response to a comment that people who punch deserve to be punched back?

You're such an unpleasant person that I'd believe you were a lawyer if you didn't spend so much of your time online bragging about it. 

Why you're so interested in winning a debate online that *wouldn't exist without your responding to my comment* is beyond me. Why you think you could ever ""win"" when the positions are so similar is equally unfathomable.

Here's my take in a nutshell, cause I'm actually enjoying your insanity:

**She deserved to get punched in the face because she punched him so very many times. If the genders were reversed the world would look at this completely differently. The fact that she is less physically dangerous has no bearing on anything in my mind**

Disagree with that at your leisure. ""Expose my ignorance"" as you promised to do 2 days ago and have yet failed to accomplish. Shitty-ass lawyer if you can't expose *my* ignorance. I'm rife with it!"

"Comparing Portuguese with Saracens is interesting. Saracens have many bonuses, most of them are bad/situational. Portuguese at least only have 3, but the effect is very much the same. Saracens lack a unit most civs have (cavalier), but they can f. upgrade most lines of units when they get to Imperial - arbalests, hussars, heavy cav archers, siege rams, siege onagers... which is the opposite of what the Portuguese can do, except for arbalests. That's why I'm safe to say all the Saracens need is a little nudge in dark/feudal to be a competitive, not OP civ. The Portuguese... I'm not so sure, but I'd say a stronger Castle Age, maybe based on an improved organ gun, could help. Aside from that, the only civ who wants to be ""master of the superlate game"" is a civ who knows it'll *get* there often."

It took me 6 days to walk ~120km (although my daily mileage was limited by the distance of the hostels I stayed at because I wasn't camping). Plan your route carefully around the places you'd like to go, and of course the ability to stock back up on water and food."
Smh No True Blackman fallacy
"Both him and more than 60% of people who already voted in a referendum in 2005, but that ended up being violated.

In truth, guns are not fully prohibited, but there is a statute implemented in 2003 (called “Disarmament Statute”) making the firearm commerce so bureaucratic and difficult that one takes years only to acquire a gun, and then some other years to keep up with the renovation process. So basically, doing that and not owning a gun is the same thing.

The law proposition that was presented in our Congress and that Bolsonaro is a heavy supporter of aims to end this statute and replace it by a much straight forward process similar to the American model: one must not have any criminal record and go through a rigorous psychological test in order to both buy their gun license and renovate it each two or five years, I believe. But still, the disinformation is so big that many people actually believe the country will become a Far West land where everybody will get a gun and start killing each other in the middle of the street."

"* If art “fixes” were suddenly banned, I wouldn’t have a problem with that at all.

* I don’t really get the love for the Muspell folks. I’m not really calling anyone out for shit taste since I have some odd picks for characters I love, but they’re all so... uninteresting to me. Laegjarn loves her sister, Laevateinn literally has no personality, and Helbindi has a soft spot for little girls. I don’t really look at them with any affection. At least with the Askr crew we’ve been with them long enough to get kinda attached, but the Muspells were just... there.

* I feel like I play this game more for the chance to summon, than actually doing the challenges the game gives. Maybe it’s because I’m pretty poor at the strategy, or maybe I’m a gambler at heart. Maybe this isn’t so unpopular, but I dunno.

* I hate Lewyn, and everything about him, and I recognize it’s for completely silly reasons: fucking Chain Challenge Book 2 Chapter 12. Motherfucker’s speed and Forseti just annihilated me *every time*. Again, I’m poor at strategy, so fuck, I knocked my head against the wall trying to beat the two maps he appeared in. I realize he was a quick boi in FE4, but fuck, that speed *inverse desperation!?* He just slaughtered all my EP units! God, I hate him as much as I hate the Reins.

* And I guess that’s my last one, I still despite that Reinhardt. I have some good checks for his original form, but of course they gave him the laziest looking alt with another stupid weapon. Man, fuck him. Just looking at that alt makes me mad. I’ve refused to ever 5* my Rein out of spite. It makes things harder, but I wouldn’t ever ask a F2P guide-maker for a non-Rein guide, because that was my choice, and I stand by it."

"[According to the state's FAQ on the matter](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Paid_Sick_Leave.htm):

&gt;*Do I have the right to cash out my unused sick days, like I can with vacation and paid time off?*    

&gt;No, not **unless your employer's policy provides for a payout**. If you leave your job and get rehired by the same employer within 12 months, you can reclaim (restore) what you had accrued in paid sick leave, provided it was not paid out pursuant to a paid time off policy at termination.

So if there were a company policy, probably in an employee handbook, indicating it's supposed to be paid out, then you would be owed your unused sick time. It can't hurt to call and ask the manager if you don't know -- but my guess would be that corporate fast food chains would not have this type of policy."

&amp;#x200B;

Kadri, Malkin and Bergeron are Center-only eligible (I think). So it might be worth while to have a few guys that have multiple position eligibility. For me personally I strive to have one or two C only guys, with two-three C/LW or C/RW combos and in a really ideal draft, to also have a LW/RW eligible player. In my experience with Yahoo fantasy, it helps with setting up daily lineups to get maximum points if your league is a daily league. If your fantasy league is a weekly league, player eligibility matters a little less, you just want to get the best guy possible in your lineup for the week.

When they started the night-time firebombing campaign they went much lower, and casualties rose.  Some missions had five percent losses, others had few or none.  Five percent's not good, but it was a lot better than European range.  Japanese cities didn't have good anti-aircraft defenses, nor did they have night fighters.

The other cool thing about a B-29 is that it floated rather well after ditching.  So if you managed to make it halfway home and ditch well, you had a good chance of being picked up. "

"There's nothing wrong with quitting a show early. In fact if you're as far as you are, you're WAY passed the ignorant stage.

But you're right before the most recent episode. If you drop it now you're not being ignorant.

""This show did not impress me enough for me to stay engaged with it"" is completely valid criticism, and it isn't out of ignorance. It'd be ignorant to criticize any episodes you HAVEN'T seen, but if you watched a bunch of episodes and decided to drop it? That's your right to criticize. You've seen it.

"Minus bark, and adjusting for diameter at breast height (4.5 ft), that tree is closer to 65-66” DBH rather than 74”. And you need to be taking multiple measurements across that stump in order to get an accurate measurement. The flares are large, inflating the size. 

**I’m a plant appraisal committee chair for a state chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture so I’ll tell you the steps to follow:**

1) seek legal representation who is familiar with tree law

2) have a professional survey done to get exact property lines and tree ownership

3) seek out a plant appraiser who is competent and can work with plants that are missing. These are the hardest plants to appraise because of the evaluation we need to complete. It’s unlikely that their are other like species in its size range to use as a placeholder. 

4) make sure the appraiser is up to date on appraisal processes. We just had the 10th Edition of the CTLA Guide for Plant Appraisal released in the last month or so so it’s imperative that they know how to apply it. 

5) seek out the plant debris if it hasn’t been destroyed. This material is crucial and helps give a fair value. 

6) figure out the property value. Plants and landscaping only make up 10-30% of a property’s value. The more trees you have and the less it contributes to amenities the less valuable it will be. Values need to be reasonable in relation to property value. Larger trees naturally inflate value so the appraiser needs to be competent and proficient. 

7) if you’ve checked off steps 1-6 then have a plant appraisal done. 

Word of warning: do not go into this looking for a payday. MI has treble damages for wrongful tree cutting but that’s entirely up to the judge. I’ve worked cases where 40 trees between 12-24” were removed and the total value was $3,000. I’ve worked cases where a single tree could net $10-12,000. "

"Yeah, i'm utterly against this idea for that reason. It makes no sense for the fleet sent out to have any knowledge whatsoever of who paid for them to be sent out. There is no reason for it to be in the logs, for any of the officers or crew to know about it.

People have to remember the raider fleets are not autonomous, they are part of a larger collective. Rival empires don't communicate with the admiral of a raiding fleet for a job, they go through channels set up by the raiders high command, who take a job. They then design a mission and appoint a fleet. There is no reason anyone outside of the high command would have knowledge of where they money came from. 

These are an interstellar-capable organisation of marauders, not a bunch of hick thugs some minor lord hired on the outskirts of skyrim to come after you with a note in their pocket. If this were implemented, I'd be looking for mods to disable it for sheer immersion breaking,

However, from a game-play perspective it is a fantastic idea, so I suggest a compromise.

Instead of gaining information from destroyed fleets, when you destroy the raiders home bases, you can gain the logs of every raid that originated from that system. Who it was against, who paid for it, and how much damage it caused.

With this information you can then

- Use it as a causus beli if you were the raiding target 
- demand reparations/compensation from the raid purchaser, if you were the raiding target
- release the information as public, causing a large diplomatic penalty against the empire that paid for the raid within each 3rd party empire, depending on the 3rd party empires ethics.

and for the logs that have nothing to do with your empire

- offer the information to the targeted empire either as a gift, or for payment, so they can do the above
- bribe the purchasing empire for a payment, threatening to offer the information to the targeted if they refuse. 
- release the entire logs publicly, resulting in a huge one-time diplomatic penalty based on the number of raids an empire paid for, and giving all raid targets causus beli. This should really shake the political make-up of the game, potentially galaxy-war starting, federation breaking. Especially it's all logs from the start of the game. Empire A may have raided B 80 years ago and now be in a federation, but this could break that federation apart. It'll feel like real Bismarkian politicing to go through with, and the player will need to have a good sense of the diplomacy on the galactic stage to be able to predict the effects of this option.

I think this works a lot better as it 

- makes more sense
- pools all the information together, allowing for interesting information brokering-style game play. 

Add to this with the inevitable diplomacy &amp; intrigue DLC

- Spies in another empire can give you information about their raiding targets, allowing you warning (and proof!) if they raid you, or anyone else. You can then sell this information on. 
- Spies in the marauding empire, while difficult to get established, can pass on information about all raids that marauder undertakes, giving you warning if they raid you, and allowing you to pass on/sell the information to targeted empires. 

If information on who paid for a raid offers a causis beli, a chance at reparations, and diplomatic influence it becomes a valuable commodity that empires will pay for.

"This is just an armchair observation, so take it with a pinch of salt.  I just think that life looks different when it's 9,000 BC and you're paddling a canoe. Even if this theory turns out to be garbage, I'm happy that a few more people have seen a map of the Tamanrasett river. Just because.

Anyway...

The standard theory on the Richat structure requires it to be close to sea level in the past. It further requires a large corner of Africa (bigger than Libya and Asia combined) to be surrounded by water. But I don't think that either is necessary. Because islands are in the eye of the beholder. I call this the ""coast hugger"" theory. 

**Ancient boats**

Imagine you are a Greek in 9,000 BC. You just defeated some invading Atlanteans. You decide to check out their land for yourself. Long journeys were certainly possible in 9,000 BC: neolithic traders brought valuable shells from Afghanistan almost to Britain, so a journey of a few thousand miles is OK. But this is Greece, 9,000 BC: your boats are very small and simple. You can only paddle up rivers or hug the coastline. But if Atlantis is based at the Richat Structure, then hugging the coastline is all you need. So you set off.

**No land on the horizon**

First you hug the north African coast until the pillars of Hercules. You then continue down along the coast, always within sight of land. Now here's the first point: in your boat, your eyes are never more than 2 metres above sea level. So your horizon is only 5 km away. If there is land more than 5km away, and it doesn't have mountainous coasts, you simply will not see it! Back in Greece you have generations of experience to draw on, but far from home? You have zero idea what is more than 5km away. Remember that, it's important. 

**The Tamanrasett river**

The next important fact is that the Richat Structure is SOUTH of the Tamanrasett river. That's the river that flowed west from the Sahara in the wet period, and finally dried up around 3000 BC. [Full details.](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9751) The Tamanrasett river was BIG. The first clue to its existence was a big groove in the sea bed: it used to empty out so much water at its mouth that it created a great big under sea canyon! We don't know if it was as big as the Amazon, but it was in that league. So think of the mouth of the Amazon - maybe a little smaller, but not by much.

The fastest rote from Athens to the Richat Structure (before 3,000 BC) was to follow the coast until you reach the mouth of the Tamanrasett, then travel up it until you find a suitable tributary. No doubt some modest stream goes all the way to the Richat, and since your boat is small you could paddle all the way. (I suspect the Atlantean boats were small as well: after all, the Greeks defeated them. But that's another topic.) So, finally, to my point.

To get to the Richat Structure from Athens, you must cross the mouth of the Tamanrasett at some point. The mouth is probably 50km wide or so, yet your horizon is only 5km away. it feels like you are crossing open sea.

**It looks like an island**

When you crossed the river mouth you would be OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND. This would be true even if you went upriver a few km first (depending on the tide I suppose. But the big groove in the sea bed suggests that the fresh water was under the salt water) And you would be crossing in salt water. Then you see land again. From your point of view you are reaching a different island. 

**The graphic**

Once on the other side of the river mouth (covering 30 km or so!) you would select the mouth of a river, and continue. You would believie this river to be on the other island. This may not be intuitive, so I made a graphic (attached). Since we don't yet know what the Tamnarasett mouth looked like, I simply flipped the mouth of the Amazon 180 degrees. (That's explained in the faint text on the graphic.)

To summarise: to a neolithic canoeist, whose horizon was 5km away, it looks exactly like you have found a group of islands, and are crossing to the largest of them, then entering one of its rivers. 

So that's why he comes back saying ""you find a bunch of islands, and this one is by far the biggest."" Q.E.D.

**""But...""**

This would not be the only time that part of a continent was mistakenly thought to be a separate island. In the 1700s several maps showed California to be an island. 

If they explored at length then they would see the truth. But this was a long journey, to dangerous enemy lands. Our Athenian friend came to visit Atlantis, not to sight-see. He knew enough to get there then get back. That was all he needed.

Besides, this visitor comes from Greece, a land of islands all crammed together. This is exactly what he was expecting.

**Mud**

And there's more!

I mentioned that the Tamanrasett eventually dried up. So by 3,000 BC any visitors to the group of islands would just find sediment. They would be unable to travel to those islands, or to Atlantis, or any further along the ocean (which always meant coast hugging). Which was exactly as Plato said.

**Sinking into the sea**

At some point in the drying out, the Richat structure would be abandoned. Some event would be the final straw. Perhaps a minor earthquake, and it wasn't worth repairing the buildings. Many years later the news would get back to Egypt. They would see this as the gods bringing judgement at last. And if anybody did try to visit Atlantis again, the mud would stop them. The combination of an earthquake and the mud would be enough to start a rumour: Atlantis must have sunk into the sea! 

**Etc.**

I could go on and on. I think everything Plato said could be explained in a minimalist way, using minimal 9,000 BC technology and experiences. But I have written enough. I cannot claim to be an expert, and I am no doubt wrong on many things. But I do think it is worth mentioning the mouth of the Tamanrasett, and how to a neolithic visitor it might easily look like a group of islands with one gigantic island on the other side.

**tl;dr**

When you paddle a small canoe, crossing a gigantic river mouth you lose sight of land. It feels like you are heading out to sea and finding new islands. (If you don't make the journey very often.)"

"If we look at Kong: Skull Island, which was released in March, Trailer 1 was in July (8 months out), and trailer 2 was in November (4 months out). Trailer 3 was just a month before release, usually synonymous with TV spots and doesn't reveal much new.

Using that same general formula for KOTM, which comes out on the last day of May, Trailer 1 was July (10 months out), trailer 2 might be December or January (5 months out), and trailer 3 + TV spots will probably be in April (1-2 months out).

Marvel posted something on Facebook saying to expect an Avengers 4 trailer in December, so like you said, I would definitely expect trailer 2 for KOTM to come a few weeks after that."

"Nope absolutely not. I'll use one key example that is pertinent to my life as an ex-Muslim: religious satire. People mistakenly think that if you mock Islam for example, that that is the same as mocking Muslims. It is viewed as Islamophobic, 'punching down' and even racist. 
Firstly, no idea is above satirisation and criticism. Islam is a set of ideas not a group of people. 
Secondly, if you view Muslims as a vulnerable group of people in Western society, that doesn't mean you give the ideas those people hold, a free pass too. I've lived my whole life around Muslims and seen firsthand the undue power of religion, leading to exploitation and abuse. Imagine the kind of power Islam has in Muslim-majority countries and you get an inkling of just how powerful and corrupt religion can be.

"Culture is dominated by whiteness, that includes physical attraction, but it's only a barrier to a certain extent. I'm actually half white/Mexican but lived in China for a number of years, but wherever I lived my race/accent/lunch was usually noticed for the wrong reasons, so I hope we're on a similar wavelength here. I've also had a couple of friends with literally the same anxiety as you. Here goes:

* The 'James Dean look' is the same apex-masculunity bullshit in the same vain as Redpill's Chad. Statistically it ticks all the boxes that a white-dominated culture thinks is 'attractive', but an online survey doesn't say much beyond people's prejudices. You very well may pass as comfortable, but as someone who has anxiety, you have anxiety lmao. Therapy would help, and I hope I can nudge you in the right direction to being comfortable with your identity.
   * There's a documented history of white-America emasculating Asian culture. Don't have something to prove (don't compensate for other people's racism) but be a capable person. Not to gender it, but if you can be a ""man's man"" and dress well, cook, keep being reasonably-fit, have interesting hobbies, and top that off with some charisma, you're *way* ahead of the curve. All those things are great for meeting people too. That is the only thing you might need to change: *what you're capable of,* ***not*** *who you are.* *""He's always up to something interesting."" ""Have you eaten his food?"" ""Let's invite him as well!""* People will find that infinitely more respectable and attractable than an old photo of an edgy rich kid on a motorcycle.
   * If you're darker skinned and worried with how people notice you (Asian or whomever you're concerned about), particularly potential SOs, don't consider someone if your skin is a barrier to entry. Most people will have a subconscious response to it, but that's privilege for you. Until puberty I had quite dark skin and felt like something was wrong with me when a certain demographic would be really rude or reject me, but it was often the culture. The haircut didn't help.
   * Accept that people swipe with prejudice or get off dating sites. Not just along lines of race, but it's *you get what you get* for the vast majority of people. These apps are a numbers game and a lot of people you're competing with are further helped by the elo system because they're white, tall, and are well presented. A lot of people in the pick-up subs put so much work into perfect photos reflecting a perfect lifestyle to look interesting instead of actually spending that time being an interesting person. Get some great candid photos doing cool shit. Guarantee you'll get matches if you have good pictures and portray yourself and your interests well, but unfortunately you have to accept that it's a rigged game."

"Abortion is an entirely different argument. However, no matter what side of that argument you are on it is by no definition genocide. As far as I can tell the only reason you bring it up is to deflect the moral corner you have backed yourself into concerning WW2.

War is bad, genocide is worse, and moral responsibility is relative. If the only answer to genocide is war then war can be both bad and the morally responsible response. 

Attempting to blame the Second World War on American empire building is off base.  If we were discussing the First World War you might have an outside argument though you would still be on shaky ground. The greater cause of both wars was Nationalism. "

I'm pretty sure the appeal is Paul actually thinks she is racist just like him right right right?? The fact of the matter is why and when Paul took her completely out of the picture was a stream some big black guy was randomly hanging around them at a mall and everytime paul would turn around she would catch black dude and caroline Hugged up and even had a play fight on stream but you could tell it was semi real where the black dude was acting like he was taking her and caroline being like most girls wanted to see what Paul would do and this beta pussy mofo actually says fuck it dood you can have her?? So from that point forward this whole fiasco started? Why?? Simply put Paul is a beta cuck who is not capable of defending his woman or fighting for her which honestly even if the black guy could fight caroline would have rather seen Paul get his ass beat than to do what he dont? If you are just willing to shed blood for a chik that's what they love its not even so much if you win? Anyways incase your a new fag that is where all this 1st grade bullshit came from and its very elementary it's like I'm going to tell her I cant openly be with her cause then I will have to get off my beta pussy ass and defend her at times so instread I tell her it makes my job soooooo hard having to hear soooooo many kids talking about how much they dont want to see you so just stay back behind the scenes and just hide Haha Sam is more alpha than Paul and Hannah is 10 times more hot than caroline

You'll probably find a few nurses you click with just like you do in school. You don't necessarily have to fraternize outside of work. It's not really a job requirement like it may seem. As far as being on the job, nursing, especially day shift, tends to take a lot out of the introvert (I am also introverted) because you have to be on constantly.

Add to that the a child is a lifelong commitment, and it's a heck of a lot more work than raising a dog or a cat. You don't have to teach a dog or cat morals, or math, or help them when they experience their first heart break, or they develop some crippling mental disorder.

"Regular season stats only.  This is not me sharing my opinion of the team, merely an attempt to explain why casual fans don't notice as much.

From 2016 to now you have won 21 games, with a mean margin of victory of 7.14 points.  Over that time period you have won by more than 14 only two times (21 &amp; 22).  Excluding those as outliers, your mean margin of victory is 5.63 points.  Your median margin of victory is 4 points, and your modal margin of victory is 3 points, occurring 28.57% of the time.

From 2016 to now you have lost 15 games, with a mean margin of defeat of 11.13 points.  You have lost by more than 10 only three times (21, 23, &amp; 43).  Excluding those as outliers, your mean margin of defeat is 6.67 points.  Your median margin of defeat is 7 points, and your modal margin of defeat is 7 points, occurring 26.67% of the time.

Even when you manipulate the data favorably, the defeats appear more convincing than the victories.  So for the casual observer looking at the scores instead of worrying about the standings, when they see you win it's commonly by 3 or less and when they see you lose it's commonly by 7.  You also have much more convincing losses than victories, so if they remember a specific Titans result it's probably a bad one.

You're further hurt by the fact that everybody has been viewing the AFCS as a weak division (and with good reason) so people expect you to get wins against your division opponents.  Over the past 4 seasons (not including this season) the total number of wins for all the teams in each division is:

1. AFCE - 138
2. AFCW - 135
3. NFCN - 133
4. NFCW - 130
5. NFCE - 129.5
6. NFCS - 128.5
7. AFCN - 124
8. AFCS - 108

As you can see the difference between 1-7 is greater than the difference between 7-8.  All of these things put together make the Titans seem like a relatively unimpressive team even if they're one of the better teams in the league."

#Section 0: Palms and Bonsais


Atomic Bonsai = AB, Wild Wild West = WWW, Rock the House = RtH, Lemon Demon = LD, The Hanging Tree = THT, Stuck in the Middle = SitM, Atom Tan = AT, Scar Tissue = ST 


Buffalo matches RtH’s SPD; Mute matches it and has two mobility based skills, and AB fully outspeeds it. As a result, it’s wholly possible that they have the agility to make Swapping difficult.


AB’s B DUR keeps up with RtH’s B POW.



Judges have confirmed that if RtH’s size is significantly different from its target, it will not be able to bodyswap. With R2M8 as precedent, AB changing the sizes of Users also affects their Stands’.


Likewise, Buffalo also has AGI and Climbing 4 and Projectiles 5. The latter justifies his ability to aim with WWW far more than Destiny’s Restauranter 5, due to Projectiles 5’s specificity.


There is a good amount of people around which could be used to block line of sight or be used as cover.


Interesting to note, even though it seems like Destiny and Damon are in the better starting position, we are actually not in too bad of a position for being able to cover each other while Damon and Destiny cannot protect each other as well since they are farther apart, and are in a better position to rush either one and run from the other.


Given AB’s ability to multiply matter, assume that AB will keep Mute’s (and Buffalo’s, if he is nearby) inventories topped off. Similarly, AB can inflate objects to feed oases, speeding up fruit creation.


To quote R2M4, “[a] sponge has the exact water capacity of one LD.” After careful measurement, the average kitchen sponge has a capacity of 1/3 of a Cup, given that these are “suspiciously absorbent kitchen sponges,” it seems reasonable to raise this to a full Cup. With all six tentacles holding onto sponges and that “the transfer rate from water to other liquids is 1:1,” LD has a max capacity of 7 Cups or 1656 mL, maybe lower.



Any items held by or stuck a person would NOT follow after Swapping. Items worn or in their pockets (clothing, most inventory) would follow. Moreover, swapping a User will teleport the Stand, but swapping a humanoid Stand will pull the Stand as close to Damon’s position as its range allows.


For the sake of the strat, North refers to ‘up’ on the map, since that was an issue in Destiny’s last match.


#Section 1:[Savior of the Dreaming Dead](https://youtu.be/Y0PIafh0ssQ)



*“Haha, get it? It’s a tropical pun--” “Got tree.”*



Buffalo will immediately shoot WWW at the fountain behind Destiny. This will create an oasis that covers the entire fountain, the sand absorbing all of the water therein. The tree will sprout at an angle instantaneously, aiming to launch THT out and away from Destiny, flying south-westwards towards Mute. Due to the nature of the oasis, Buffalo is able to control the angle of how the tree grows, and with Projectiles 5, this tech is very well within his ability. This can be tried multiple times if Destiny tries to block the shots, see contingencies below. Immediately after the tree goes flying, Buffalo will open fire on Destiny, forcing him to choose between using Lemon Demon to protect the tree or himself. His poor END means that a few shots from WWW may put him down. If Destiny grabs THT before they can, the tree/shots will be aimed to knock it out of his hands towards where Mute can get it momentarily. 


Buffalo will begin running south, while keeping pressure up on Destiny and [pin](https://goo.gl/bGMJxw) LD. Buffalo will make shots at Destiny (aiming for vulnerable or crippling areas and tissue such as the eyes or his legs) and/or in front of him to create sandy terrain that is hard to traverse over and slows Destiny down. This is to occupy him and LD to block/dodge, cripple his movement, and/or have the sand eat his equipment. The sand will also be effective for eating any normal liquid LD tries to spill out. Trees from these oases will grow as close to Destiny as possible, and at a backwards angle to knock him backwards with C POW, away from the player team or to block his path. With his modest speed and these obstacles in his way, Destiny will be hard-pressed to close the gap.

 
Additionally, Buffalo will also be keeping track of RtH’s position at any given moment in-case he is approaching or trying to run away. If Damon or RtH is heading for him, Buffalo will run from or shoot at/near them depending on how close they are, as well as how close Mute and AB are. If RtH gets close enough to be able to quickly position swap him, Buffalo will go prone and roll to put Damon into a prone state with heavier gravity if he decides to position swap. Buffalo can also shoot the ground beside him, latching onto the tree as it grows sideways for some burst mobility and potential cover. This maneuver can also net Buffalo palm leaves and an Atom Tan for later use to use against Damon/RtH if needed by throwing it over them so it will hit them and not him in closer range. Mute will already have been harrassing Damon and occupying Damon if he has chosen to use RtH to target Buffalo. If Destiny isn’t an imminent threat, Buffalo can provide supporting fire against Damon and RTH.


Meanwhile, Mute will be heading south towards Damon, while/after catching the flying THT. Using AB to help deal with RtH and her 4 Escape and AGI to help her dodge while weaving past the few people that are there. While on her skateboard, Mute will be using a few different tactics for fighting Damon as they rush for him. AB outspeeds RtH and will dodge punches to get to Damon/RtH, trying to shrink them as much as she can without endangering herself, in order to negate RtH’s ability to Swap.


RtH will be tracked of for if/when he tries to position swap with the random civilians nearby. If it escapes out of Mute/AB’s immediate range towards Destiny, Buffalo will fire at Damon to do more damage to him. The oases that are already there would have also dissuaded/confused the civilians there to keep away from that area and by extension Destiny. Finally, AB can also inflate/deflate the space around Damon/RtH to throw off their positioning, giving SR an opportunity to escape.


**If Destiny tries to block WWW shots,** this pits WWW’s C POW bullets against LD’s pitiful E DUR. Trying to block shots from WWW would leave Destiny in for a few good, solid hits. 
		

**What if LD tries to render WWW useless,** If LD tries to spray at Buffalo, it risks hitting Damon as well given its D PRE and Buffalo’s movement. Moreover, Buffalo’s 5 Projectiles means he can quickly get and maintain pressure on Destiny, leaving it difficult for a clear shot to be made without getting hit, or allowing him a good understanding of Destiny’s arc to move for a counter. There is also a potential cover with the people walking around and benches as Buffalo’s moving back.  


**If LD rushes to Buffalo,** the latter will shoot WWW at the defenseless Destiny, hitting him with C POW and/or creating an oasis to sprout a tree to hit Destiny and launch him back. If LD tries to melee Buffalo/his gun, its B DUR means that it will take a bit to be destroyed and Buffalo can use it to bat at LD. 



**If LD rushes to Mute,** it might seem problematic at first, considering Mute will be focusing on Damon during the opener. But this leaves Destiny defenseless, letting Buffalo target him or LD, if at any point he sees Mute in danger of LD. Mute can stall for a few seconds by using her thrusters to hold it at bay.


**What if Destiny and Damon manage to swap places?** This probably won’t be able to happen, considering Buffalo is keeping Destiny occupied while Mute is rushing down Damon and working to shrink him to render RTH’s ability useless for the rest of the match. But in the worst-case scenario where this does occur, then Buffalo is to handle Damon while Mute faces off against Destiny. In short, we’ll fall back for a second to re-prioritize our attacks on them. 


**What if Damon tries to position swap with civilians?** Considering the NPCS are walking past uninterested, and considering RTH’s C Precision and having to align itself with moving targets, this slight opening is all Mute and Atomic Bonsai needs to rush/shrink Damon while he’s trying to swap.


**What to do if Destiny and Damon try an oil/lighter tactic?** Considering our opening plays, bombarding the two with bullets/rushdown that renders Damon’s swapping ineffective, and considering we’re stripping Destiny of the fountain, it’s very unlikely this play can be achieved, let alone be effective, because any oil that spreads on the ground is going to get absorbed by Buffalo’s oases."

"For a very, very long time I would have conversations with my ex (she was also the closest friend I ever had) in my head. For a long time I couldn't understand why I struggled so much with letting her go, It felt like an addiction. Then I learned more about BPD and it all started clicking more. I impulsively went out with many people afterwards, but never had the same connect as I did with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to apologize for all the stress I put her through for so long. All the emotional demands she had to deal with. Eventually it all got so overwhelming to the point I would just stuff it down with opiate abuse. Over the next two years I eventually stopped thinking about it until I received a text. It was her. She apologized for leaving and said she had been wondering for the longest time how I was holding up. She dreaded the idea that she may have caused me to go down a spiral. She missed me and said that I was the closest friend she had ever had.

&amp;#x200B;

I really can't explain what that message did for me. Years of beating myself up for hurting people finally felt foolish. I was just being hard on myself. I apologized to her for everything. I kept the BPD to myself, but told her that she whether she had stayed or left I still would have inevitably broken. We still casually keep in contact. Simple, honest text messages or calls. We've both finally moved on and can now communicate without all the baggage our past brought. It's honestly the healthiest relationship I have. I'm incredibly thankful. "
"If you like hoplite, you may like auro and enyo as well! Auro has a more in depth and interesting combat system, but much shorter runs. It doesn't really have progression, but it does have a ranking system, and the difficulty level depends on it. You need to not see the ranking system as a form of progression though, but more as a way to give you the difficulty that suits you best. It may be a bit getting used to, but it is great! Auro does cost money though. 

Enyo is inspired by both hoplite and auro, and somewhere in between both, and doesn't have a ranking system. It's also free with aditional modes you can unlock by paying for the premium version.

"That is not accurate. A common law marriage will be recognized if the jurisdiction the person resides in recognizes common law marriage. See [https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM010208.html](https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM010208.html)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**9 FAM 102.8-1(F)**  **Common Law Marriage**  
&gt;  
&gt;*(CT:VISA-367;   05-26-2017)*  
&gt;  
&gt;In the absence of a marriage certificate, an official verification, or a legal brief verifying full marital rights, a common law marriage or cohabitation is considered to be a “valid marriage” for purposes of visa adjudication only if:  
&gt;  
&gt;(1)  Common law marriage is recognized in the place that it is claimed is was created as being fully equivalent in every respect to a traditional legal marriage; and  
&gt;  
&gt;(2)  It bestows all of the same legal rights and duties possessed by partners in a lawfully contracted marriage:  
&gt;  
&gt;(a)  The relationship can only be terminated by divorce or death;  
&gt;  
&gt;(b)  There is a potential right to alimony;  
&gt;  
&gt;(c)  There is a right to intestate distribution of an estate; and  
&gt;  
&gt;(d)  There is a right of custody, if there are children.

  
I would say though, just living together for a long period is usually not sufficient to establish common law marriage in must jurisdictions I know. "
In that case I'd recommend using a shared Google spreadsheet. You can set all the boxes to be 1:1 squares to stand in for paper battle maps. Each character/creature/item/terrain obstacle can be assigned a color and it's a simple way to track movement and position. Also it doesn't take up a lot of internet bandwidth so you won't have to worry too much about lagging.

"I think the idea that Kavanaugh can't be an impartial judge, based solely on Thursday's testimony, is ludicrous. 

His impartiality is demonstrated through the 1,500 cases he adjudicated and the over 300 judicial opinions he authored. After months of scrutiny, nobody has pointed out a single case or opinion that demonstrates he is unable to be an impartial judge. 

If a senator challenged him about a former opinion or former case, and he acted the way he did Thursday, then there would be legitimate concerns about his judicial temperament. 

But, what we saw Thursday had nothing to do with judicial impartiality and temperament. It was the temperament of a guy whose family is being threatened and who is enduring a vicious, partisan smear campaign. He was right to call it out as such. 

Judges should be impartial when adjudicating a case. That doesn't mean that they have to passively take a beating when they are being treated as a punching bag. "

"I definitely employ some degree of quality control when it comes to stuff I'll actually formally add to my collection (catalog, put in poly sleeves, shelve). Sometimes I'll just have someone bring me a whole box or two of records, saying ""Hey, I heard you collect records, and I thought you might be interested in some of these, but you have to take them all."" If they're too trashed and are something I like, then they go in the garage for eventual repurposing (decorative projects, etc.). If they're not something I'm interested in at all, they get donated. I won't buy anything in store that's too trashed, unless it's something compelling (I bought a first pressing of Magical Mystery Tour for a buck a few years back, complete inner booklet and all; it had a very noticeable bowl warp but actually ended up playing surprisingly well).

At this point, I'm being extra selective about the LPs I buy, as they take up a lot of space. I don't have a ton of vacant shelving left, and I don't really want to add more. I have about 1500+ LPs/10""s. I also have a fair amount of records I've never gotten around to listening to, but I picked them up at some point because it was a fantastic price that I couldn't pass up, basically the same thing as OP and the bargain bins. Lots of brand-new stuff that I got for 75% off or more. So the backlog is a factor, too. I may sell off some of it eventually.  


My advice would basically be, make sure you legitimately want it, make sure it's in playable condition, make sure you plan to enjoy it eventually. If you look at a record and think, ""Is this just going to end up sitting on my shelf"" and the answer is even close to ""yes,"" save your money for something else you want later on."

That’s not a judgment on you, we don’t know each other, but it’s good to start by remembering that, if he does, it’s his choice and you can’t change that.

Beyond that, I’d say let him know you like it when he responds back. This is different than being clingy, and certainly not something you’re going to order him to do. Let him know you like knowing he’ll get back to you when you text, and if it feels right let him know *gently* why you like that. Stress you like the way you communicate, and you want him to feel he can be open with you.

Focus on the positive instead of expressing it as a fear, though if he asks you directly if you had a bad experience definitely be honest. Basically, the best thing you can do is let him know communication’s a big part of what you like in your relationships, and you hope he appreciates that, too."

"I'm playing on Storyteller mode at the moment, just because I heard the game could be really punishing to a first-timer. I've been having fun exploring, but I think I'm going to start slowly ramping up the difficulty now that I'm starting to get a hang of the mechanics. The main selling point for me, other than nostalgia for the tabletop campaign, was the kingdom-building side of things and the ability to impact the world around me with my choices. I didn't want to worry too much about being punished by the gameplay side of things, but I'm in Act 2 now and it actually is easy enough that I think I'm going to try a little bit harder.

I've actually played the tabletop version of Kingmaker before, but CRPGs involve a completely different skillset imo. The fact that it's real-time combat rather than turn-based makes it a lot harder to get positioning right for area-of-effect spells and stuff, and I find it easier to build a character effectively when you're just focusing on your own character rather than building an entire team (because I get too impatient to read oops)."

I have one and yes it is 1/2x28.
"I'm not a big fan of one night stands mostly because the sex is rarely that good.  It is thrilling to know that you can make someone you met so hot that they just want to take you home and fuck you, though.

So with that to frame the story, here it is in brief.  I was 26, traveling in Boston for work, and took the weekend after my work trip to check out the city.  I wander into a coffee shop and get a latte and relax for a bit, flipping through whatever random newspaper I found by the door (this was before smart phones).  It was pretty dead so the barista starts chatting with me.  She was a smoking hot blonde, curvy like I like them, and we start flirting back and forth.  Now normally I don't bother women at work, but I figure that since she started it, I was on solid ground.

She finds out I'm leaving the next day and writes her address on a napkin and casually slips it into my shirt pocket while giving me total sexy eyes, then whispers ""9pm, be there"".

I show up, we have some wine, then fuck like half the night.  She was a great lay, totally into it, loved receiving oral, rode my dick like a total champ, gave me ass play with her finger while I was cumming and everything.

Then I left for my flight at 6am and never saw her again."
I sincerely hope that the women in America are taking note.
I hope this brings in a few more fans!

"Sorry, but ""protecting the victim's identity"" does not excuse Feinstein's decision to conceal even the very fact that these allegations of this kind had been made. These facts are manifestly relevant to an ongoing processes.  Making the existence of these allegations known sooner, rather than stonewalling till her hand was forced by Ryan Grim's reporting, would have encouraged other women to come forward sooner. I'm frankly disgusted that the notion of ""victim's rights"" are being thrown around in this nonsensical manner to excuse Feinstein's behavior. Shielding the victim's identity does not excuse DiFi from performing her duty to fight the Republican nominee.

"&gt;bridges, median dividers, and other obstructions

Most of all of the freeways are pretty rural with a few miles between overcrossings. The median barriers weren't included in the original design (iirc). The ones in use now can be quickly and easily removed should the need arise.

The ""hundred miles or so"" thing is more ""there's at least one, but probably 30 or 40, suitable places to turn a section of this freeway into a runway and install a supply chain bypass and temporary building within 100 miles of here.""

It's easy, if not tedious as modern aircraft ar a lot more sensitive to debris just laying around on the ground. A ""suitable"" section of freeway still has a lot of work before you can land anything other than a C130 Hercules or a CH-47 Chinook on it."

Some questions worth asking:

* Would this wizard be willing to ally with evil people to take down this government?

* If the wizard had to decide between the life of his friends and the fate of the kingdom , which would be choose? What about between his friends and his lichdom? What about between the fate of the kingdom and his lichdom?

* Does your wizard engage in other necromancy? Whose corpses does he raise, under what circumstances, and how does he use them?"

Are you sure you have no local camera repairmen? I found my camera guy in my city just on Yelp; it's a small mom and pop shop that's been around forever, no website, but they had excellent reviews. Often a reputable repairman will give you an estimate for the repair for a small quote fee (which goes toward the cost of repair), whereas mailing it in is kind of like--you're stuck with whatever bill they tell you. I wish I had more advice to offer; perhaps some of the more tech-oriented folks can jump in. Either way, good luck!!"

"That both GC and QT have a habit of only remembering trans men exist when it's convenient for an aside point at the moment, tbh. I'm also disappointed how easy it is for 'feminists' to ignore how infantilizing and misogynistic ROGD is in assuming young trans men (AFAB people) are too impressionable to resist throwing out their entire identity for a passing 'social contagion' fad, while AMAB people are rarely questioned to be that naive or incompetent about their own bodies. I'm also disappointed that a group so saturated with lesbian/bi women don't think to draw any connections to the fact that less than a decade ago people were making similar claims related to the 'shocking rise' of visible bisexual and gay women and how they must be doing it for attention/social approval. It seems like a lot of GC posters are willing to completely ignore same old arguments about AFAB people being incapable of making informed decisions about their own bodies and reproductive systems when those arguments happen to feed anti-trans sentiments.

"The idea that you should choose to 'advance your field' just because you happen to be good at it is utterly absurd. If you don't enjoy doing something, there's zero gain in devoting your life to it. 

I'm guessing you have never attempted academic research before. Firstly, it's not enough to just be a natural genius. A lot of researchers need plenty of other skills, including people skills, writing skills, time-management skills, etc to be a full-time researcher. Nobody will fund your research if you can't prove you can do those things. Secondly, if you don't have a huge passion for the research you're doing, then you can't succeed. No matter how good you are at maths (in this scenario, specifically number theory), you can't make progress if you aren't willing to spend every working day reading and writing papers, thinking about problems, attending conferences, etc.

Andrew Wiles is one of the greatest number theory geniuses. He was determined to solve Fermat's Last Theorem since he was 10 years old, and spent almost every available hour of 6 years of his life dedicated to solving it. He couldn't have done that if wasn't incredibly dedicated and passionate about his field."

"The first thing is go through your spices. Do you really use all of them? (For instance I use poultry seasoning instead of all the respective herbs.). Anything that is used rarely can go in the main pantry.

Next, double your space. Pick out the spices you use most and put them on the inside of the door. You can buy spice holders that use the original bottle, or get a sheet of metal and use magnetic tins (they were very popular a few years ago. By using the door you make your favorite spices easily accessible, and they’re not cluttering up the front row of the shelf. 

For bottles and large canisters I like to use a lazy Susan, and you can find small ones on the Internet. You lose some space but everything is easy to grab and it keeps you from overstuffing the cabinet. 

I prefer the pull out spice racks but I’m not sure offhand if there are any that narrow. Take a look at makeup organizers, you can usually find narrow plastic “steps” for fingernail polish, but they work equally well for spices. "

Well,
1) If it affects ME, I think I should be allowed an opinion. besides, how about you argue the facts on their own merits, and not just shut down a discussion because you don't have a response. Don't just try to shut me down because you're a bigot.

2) We're all HUMAN, perhaps if we began to think of the things we have in COMMON, not the DIFFERENCES, we'd get along better. Dividing people along racial/gender/whatever lines never ends well. Just ask all the amputees from the Hutu-Tutsi conflict. (Apologise if I sounded like a hippie here...)

"Eating less definitely makes a huge difference. 

I think some people are also turned off by meat alternatives (veggie burgers, tofu, tempeh). I actually don’t even like meat alternatives and would much rather have the real thing. So if I crave a burger I’ll eat one. But I’d say 95% of the time I’m eating vegan. I eat lentils and beans for my protein. I just switched out my normal recipes. I used to make chili all the time with beef but now I use beans and lentils in it. I love pizza but I’ll make it without cheese and meat. I use beans and sweet potatoes in enchiladas. I used to do a lot of chicken Indian dishes but now I use chick peas instead.

Edit:
I think it’s also important to note that this transition for me has been over 3 years. It was little by little. The best thing you can do is start slow. This will help you adjust your taste profile and prevent frustration when cooking. "

"&gt; you cant compare the two teams because csgo was a lot different 3 years ago than it is now.

You play at the level of your competition. In 2014-2015 we had Fnatic, LDLC, Envy, NiP, Virtus Pro, TSM, etc. All dominant teams, and one of the most truly competitive era of CSGO.

Fnatic played the teams they were dealt, and won time and time again. Pronax's Fnatic can absolutely be compared to Xizt's Fnatic, and it's tilted heavily in favor of Pronax. Look at it this way, the one major they play with Xizt is the one major Fnatic finally leaves in group stages. Not something to be proud of.

This is like how people try to deny GeT_RiGhT's talent just because the scene was newer. He played his opponent's, and landed himself Top 1 for two years in a row. He deserved it, regardless of his competition.

"This almost exactly, except for the hole in the wall. The signs were really there from the beginning of the relationship though. He is a mentally unstable person who deals with depression and anxiety. It was an ongoing battle the entire 9 years. There was never a time he wasn’t dealing with it because he never tried to make it better by switching meds or seeing a therapist or anything. I had to help him get jobs cause he never had motivation to do it. Then he would just up and quit jobs randomly and for no good reason (paranoia). We had 2 kids to support and it was very frustrating. He never helped with the kids. We hardly were intimate because he annoyed and frustrated me so I was just turned off constantly. He would threaten to kill himself all the time. When he quit his 50k a year job to go to school and barely work, we had to live with his parents and it just went to hell. It was already headed there but that just was the icing on the cake. I stayed for a while longer but I was emotionally done. He began drinking every day almost all day, gained over 100lbs, never worked. I was so stressed out. He was at least going to school but I didn’t want to deal with that same situation for 4 more years while he finished. Been separated for 2 months now and I’m so much happier. I do miss him occasionally just cause we were together so long but I know there’s someone else out there that will be an actual partner with me."
I wouldn't consider Mysterio a C list villain. More like a mid B list or low B list at worst. Take it this way prior to the mcu more people would know who mysterio is than those who even knew thanos existed. Mainly due to the popularity of the Spider-Man cartoons and him being featured in pretty much all of them. Mysterio is to spider-man what the riddler is to batman. Not his most iconic villain but definitely not a fodder villain that he has an easy time dealing with.

"Still waiting for your ""harsh truths"". You haven't mentioned any yet. Looks like just another rationalization for why your foreveralone situation is not your doing. 

People are reacting negatively to the things you say because you keep harping over and over on the same things while ignoring everything people tell you. Of course that will make people frustrated and angry with you over time. Particularly when you try to pass yourself off as a authority on a subject that you are completely ignorant of.

Replaced the 2700 with the X and removed the cooler. The Ryzen 2700X does not need overclocking, so a cooler is not *really* needed. Ofc you can add one if you feel like it. 

While you can get a B350 board and have the 2XXX ryzen work out of the box, it's not worth risking it in order to save less than 5 pounds. So I put the equivalent B450 board.

That RAM is the cheapest 3000 RAM in the UK - also low profile and matches the board.

I replaced the 1060 with the 580. Same performance in general (i'd argue even better) but cheaper and freesync support.

The lite-on drive was cheaper. It's not like you're going to use it often but anyway :P.

Wireless adapter is better that what you've selected and is worth that little extra (has intel chipset not realtek crap)."

#Section 2: Wrecking [Havoc](https://youtu.be/Wq0SjupReyA)


*“I’m in the mood for Mexican, you want anything?” “Food.”*


Having escaped the initial set up, Buffalo and Mute continue southward. Buffalo will keep kiting to delay HoH, creating more oases and trees in their paths, and firing at stores/water sources (like the restroom and restaurant drink dispensers) that Destiny tries/may try to get at to block off or destroy them, or firing at RtH/Damon to put him out for good if possible.  If needed, AB can also help harass RtH as they try to get out of his 20m range. Mute will use AB to help with mobility, expanding space behind them to create distance. 

If her board is still available, she can temporarily shrink Buffalo and carry him, as she skateboards away, AB expanding space behind her and shrinking space in front of her to rocket her away and regrowing Buffalo if need be. Alternatively, Buffalo can ‘spring’ them forwards by spawning trees beneath them, AB expanding space to cushion their fall. If RTH looks like it’s in position to swap with shrunken Buffalo, Mute will quickly grow him back.

As they travel away, Buffalo will create oases in front of them to grow SitM and AT, AB retrieving and bringing them to him through shrinking space. The fruits themselves will also be shrunk, causing them to fly faster and be harder to block. Our priority is still to defeat Damon as soon and safely as possible, so Buffalo will target him with these fruits: the SiTMs’ sticky, B DUR adhesive being more than enough to restrain his diminutive body for a considerable period of time before finishing him off with an AT or WWW shot. Damon will be prioritized, but the same strategy can also be used against Destiny afterwards. Additionally, AB will grow the leaves so to work as B DUR cloaks, giving SR some defense which Mute can easily repair or replace.


Once it’s safe to do so, AB will get food from trash cans to give to Buffalo. Given the entitlement and low patience of the civilians, they may waste food or leave scraps they don’t finish that can be grown to considerable size by AB for Buffalo to eat. In fact, the civilians might even leave their used disposable bowls and drinks on the table once they finish eating. Alternatively AB can sneakily take some from an unaware person that is busy eating. The food will most likely be from the Dairy Queen/Orange Julius and Pretzel place nearby and Buffalo will eat it. Something similar can be done to the restaurants in the SE corner, Fusion 212 and the Japanese Steak/Sushi Place. AB will take some food and/or silverware off the trays of the people that leave it there when finished or from the trash bins inside. It goes without saying but the past three paragraphs occur in motion and within the same time frame.


Buffalo can also create Oases out of walls, causing them to crumble and letting SR clip through walls and cut corners. These tactics may be used to shake HoH’s trail or sneak into restaurants to grab food and/or silverware.

	
Once at the SE corner, Buffalo will then make a tree, climb onto the roof and check for signs of Destiny or Damon. From this vantage point he should be able to cover the parking lot and south part of the mall and locate Destiny if he is around. After gathering a good number of fruit for them each to carry, the two will make their way from the SE corner of the mall, up through the parking lot, using the cares and trees in the lot as cover, and back into the top middle entrance of the mall near where the Starbucks (360) is. If they meet Destiny in the parking lot or he has continued chasing them, Buffalo can snipe at him from his vantage point and throw ATs at him, AB can also toss the miniature ATs in its possession to take out Destiny.   	


**If Destiny and/or Damon catches up,** AB will inflate space between then as Buffalo catapults them away with a tree.  


**If Damon attempts to run away** Buffalo will restrain him with SitM, and promptly put him down with a WWW shot or an AT.


**If HoH is ever in possession of THT,** Mute will grow a bread crumb, taping it to an SitM with Buffalo’s tape, which will all be held together with Buffalo’s rope. This contraption will be fired at THT. The SitM will break upon contact, sticking the artifact to the crumb. SR will pulls on the rope as AB shrinks it, yanking it from the grasp of whoever may hold it. This strategy can be repeated as necessary, or AB can shrink space to pull it into its grasp.


#Section 3: [Aggrievocation](https://youtu.be/JB3kKp7jRag)


At this point we should have enough supplies to deal with Destiny. Now every once and awhile Buffalo will climb to the roof to gain a vantage point and Mute will search through the various store windows that are around for Destiny. Buffalo will also take out every water supply visible to him as soon as possible such as the Koi Ponds, Restrooms, and bar the doors to Restaurants with oases. The duo will head westward and AB will still help Buffalo sample whatever food it can get from table scraps to trash cans before the final confrontation. The available foods will very likely be Pizza, Mexican food, and Italian food from the plaza slightly to the north; Kettle Korn from the Kiosk; and if they go all the way to the NW corner, there is beef jerky, sandwiches, french pastries, pizza, and pretzels. The only eateries left untouched would be the three in the North East corner that they will head back to if they have not found/confronted Destiny yet.



Ideally they will face Destiny from range and can throw ATs and SitMs at him if Damon is already down. If not, their offensive efforts will be split between HoH, prioritizing Damon. AB and Buffalo will both bombard HoH with fruit, with Buffalo on a vantage point, eroding their cover with WWW and shooting him. If HoH uses a method of long ranged attack, we have high ground and cover that can help mitigate that. There are also buildings that can be ducked into for cover. Buffalo can even use WWW to eat through a roof he is on and duck inside a building for cover. Mute will also expand extra cover out of pebbles and other objects if needed.


Mute and Buffalo can also keep distance by firing Buffalo’s slingshot with various things that can be picked up in the vicinity--rubble, forks, SitMs, ATs, and STs. However, before firing, Mute will attach inflation orbs on the ammo, so the projectiles gradually grow as they fly over to the targets. Pelting HoH with projectiles that grow will wear the both of them down over time, even if LD is used to deflect. Mute can also massively elongate forks and knives to impale either enemy from long range. 


Alternatively, Mute can also attach shrink orbs to Buffalo’s fruits and fire them, particularly onto ATs/SitMs to make them imperceivable while in flight, but just as dangerous. ST’s are confirmed to grow and shrink in radius depending on size, so laying out traps in doorways, the street, under HoH’s feet, and in general areas we would expect him to make contact with will be laid out with these traps, along with oases and their impeding sand and trees.


If HoH is closer, SitMs and ATs will be used to quickly deal with their movement and Stands. Both of them will be fairly cautious with Buffalo traveling along the roofs and Mute with AB to defend herself. If Buffalo is out of position, he still has Mini-ATs to deal with Destiny and will duck for/make cover as needed. 


If Destiny keeps camping, we can wait all day in the NW corner of the mall with a vantage point of both to the south and to the east with a growing food and ammo supply and AB on the roofs. 


It is possible that Destiny might wait inside a restaurant or next to a fountain/pond for the water supply or at the Mall Office in order to look at the security cameras. We will pay more attention looking for Destiny in these building and take out the water sources we can see. We can potentially even trap him inside with oases or collapse the building on him. We will check the Mall Office and break down the walls with WWW to look for him and take him out from the roof. 


If Destiny creates any sort of deadly gas or vapor invisible to the naked eye, we will be able to tell to the extent by the lack of/unconscious civilians in that area. We will use Buffalo’s pelt and Mute’s scarf to help keep from inhaling the fumes. From there, it’s a simple game of shooting down at him or Damon with WWW and fruits.

Mute will keep her distance as much as possible, as usual, expanding and shrinking space and skateboarding around to keep the HoH at arm’s length."

"So you're going to ignore the rapist owing a debt to the family? Remember that women were not treated as social equals in the bronze-age middle east (continuing issues being a separate conversation). What he wanted was as little consideration as what she wanted, which is pretty consistent with cultures in which arranged marriages are the norm and saving face is paramount.

These cultural artifacts continued all the way into American culture - see ""shotgun wedding"". The idea of a person trying to turn around and do the right thing, including asking forgiveness of the woman and her family is built into that whole process.

Deuteronomy's verses on ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" referred to pre-existing monetization of injuries. You see the same thing today. My uncle avoided it, but a coworker when he worked at the lumber mill in Alaska lost his thumb and as they brought him to the helicopter to go to the hospital they joked, ""that's thirty-thousand right there!"" The amount referred to the settlement they expected him to get."

"Involves me.

In HS I had French with my best friend (He is black, I'm White). 

I cut class almost every day. My grandmother spoke French and I had a better-that-first-year-HS-French grasp on the language, though I didn't and don't speak even close to fluently.

Anyways the teacher said that 70% of the grade was the final and I was confident in my ability to ace it, based on the work that was being presented in class.

Meanwhile, my best friend, who I tutored (unofficially of course) occasionally, busted his ass. Every day in class, trying his best to understand the language. He genuinely wanted to learn, too, but really was focused on getting good grades.

Finals come. I ace it, as I expected. My best friend barely passes, but does pass. 

Report Cards come... I got a B+ in the class that I attended maybe 15% of and turned in ZERO assignments, in class or homework, while my best friend got a C- while he worked tirelessly to learn, studied, did every assignment and turned in all his homework.

Seemed totally unfair to me then and still seems unfair to me now. All that effort only to get a low grade. "

"As i read the papers a chill went down my spine. I thought of the papers as some sort of rambling due to his old age, but they still made me feel uneasy. 

There was a set of instructions attached to the paper. The instructions where for some kind of telescope but most of it was missing, i contacted my other colleagues and after a long discussion we settled on building the telescope.

The materials seemed strange and much of the device seemed pointless, but we followed his instructions to the letter. When we were finished we guessed it could see up too nine million light years. Sam went first, he looked into the telescope and started bleeding. His hands and eyes where red with blood, and after three days he bleed to death.

I was up next. I looked into the scope and saw a man, only the man had demonic features such as wings and horns. Finally i noticed his eyes, you could make out every detail of his eyes. The creatures head shifted towards me and looked straight at me. The next thing i knew i was in a puddle of blood. Only it was not mine, it was the creatures blood deep inside of me."

"It's pervasive element common to a lot of fiction in that most technical people are omnidisciplinary experts in their field. A ""scientist"" in fiction might be an expert in temporal mechanics as well as aeromotive engineering. A ""chemist"" might be able to give a lecture on exoplanetary biochemistry one day then help a forensics team analyze the remnants of an azoazide azide device the next.

The reason it's done is for the expedience of the story. Having a new character for every specialty as would be the case in real life would bog down the story and overload it with characters. As with most things the important thing to remember is not to take everything at face value. Any expert in fiction is likely serving as a composite character representing a whole team of experts. "

"&gt; FOX news was pumping out birther movement shit in 2008 when McCain ran against Obama.

Have you no sense of scale? Right wing media accused the president of forging a birth certificate.

Left wing media was surreptitiously colluding with a presidential candidate to try to swing the election. This was confirmed in the Podesta emails; they weren't just sympathetic and hoping she would win the way that Fox was with Trump, they were secretly working together with the Hillary campaign to put out the narrative the DNC wanted. They were feeding debate questions to Hillary in advance. They were coaching town hall responses. We have proof of *all* of this.

"There are a lot of problems with the Republican Party, but it should be kept in mind that it wasn't formed specifically around racism, sexism, and general idiocy.

However, he knew more about gun control laws in America than I did. Whereas most of the people I heard from before him had relatively simplistic perspectives on the issue, he actually had excellent arguments about which gun control laws were ineffective and which ones weren't necessary."

"It’s definitely hard to stay quiet on social media and in real life when a situation presents itself.  I was still a libfem almost two years ago, but I started peaking in the aftermath of the first Women’s March (I will wear my pussy hat loud and proud, TYVM).  I’m still not totally sure I’m a radfem, but I’m grateful for the GC community here.  

Thankfully my few trans and TRA friends are mostly social media friendships anymore, so I’m just careful about what I post.  Nothing GC or anti-trans, and I don’t share pro-trans stuff either.  It helps that I’m straight and don’t personally follow too much LGBT+ stuff anyway.  Occasionally I’ll share things that are generically liberal that might mention bathroom bills among other fights for equality just to throw them off.  I did have one recent private interaction that I posted about on here that I dodged with a “sorry, feel free to ignore.”  Tumblr is a toxic wasteland that I avoid.  

I do have to be careful about what I say in the context of my job in a public school (boss is a very vocal progressive).  We actually had to watch the Katie Couric piece on transkids two years ago in a meeting.  Thankfully that was the last I’ve heard of it, and we’re back to mostly focusing on racial equity and trauma-informed teaching which are both worthy and reasonable issues to focus on.  My students are in preschool, so they haven’t formed their identities too much beyond sex and race.

I have been able to discuss my GC stance a little bit with my husband.  He’s been very supportive of my need to attend the Women’s Marches and witnessed the trans takeover that I saw.  He’s also had run ins with TIFs in the LGBT+ community for years (he’s a self-identified ally who was involved to voice support for his lesbian grandma).  He’s not a perfect feminist ally (he has issues with #MeToo, of course; he knows my stance given my history), but at least we can have relative peace at home, and I don’t have to bottle up my feelings.  I don’t discuss GC in person with other people.  For the most part it doesn’t come up in the context of my close friend group since we’re all white, straight, and “cis”."

AMZN has a price to book ratio of about 28.  Their assests are worth 1/28th of their market cap.  AMZN also has a P/E of about 160.  This is used to compare price and the amount of revenue coming in.  Note that the SPX average is usually about 25.  AMZN has a large p/e because the market is heavily pricing in future growth."

"Apparently you know nothing of world history...otherwise you wouldn’t question me about why I do not consider them “fellow countryman”. In simple terms....they were a civilization that held a land that other...more powerful people desired. They were ordered to assimilate or leave. When they protested....they were eliminated....end of story....Essentially what the Romans, Muhammad, Napoleon, Hitler and countless others have done....I am not saying it was right or wrong....just facts....And....we will just have to agree to disagree on America’s foreign policy goals. You have stated your views....I....on the other hand believe that the United States has always tried to install a Democracy whenever given the chance...unfortunately it usually fails because these “civilizations” are not yet ready for a democracy and seem to prefer being ruled by the few.

When Heaven Canceller warns how dangerous it is and he can't save a dead person, it's probably time to rethink what you're doing. 

I wonder if Last Order has Accelerator's number set as ""Accelerator"". Touma seems unaware who he is calling.

Despite Accelerator being weaker, he is still strong enough to lift a building and slam it into another building.

Thomas looks to be running windows 7. Thomas is the 4th director to die, the other 3 were killed by Vento.

"Well first of all, Ranked gameplay should require various pre-requisites to make matchmaking a more fair and balanced experience for all... such as:

A.) Player Account Level: (MAX), currently this is (30).

B.) At least one Arcana Page with Total Arcana Lvl for that page being (MAX), currently this is (90).

C.) Ranked tiers only allow players to use heroes they own with (Seasoned) proficiency or above.


This would make Ranked gameplay much more fair and would encourage players to play their heroes as optimally as possible. Standard gameplay would be more about learning new heroes, trying out different builds, and for casual matches.

Ranked would be serious, competitive, and the pre-requisites would lessen the amount of trolling that happens in ranked play."

"This actually reminds me of those entry gate thingies, whatever they're called...

At my local supermarket, one of them was pushed closed one time. Normally they open when you get near, but because this one was swung open in the *wrong direction*, it *closed* when I walked through, and it hit my leg. The way I hit it also was basically directly edge-on, meaning it didn't budge to either side. I just got rammed in the leg with a chrome pole at the speed of a brisk pace. Not awful or anything, especially since it was very much rounded, but still painful.

So, the moral of the story is... Supermarkets are dangerous? I dunno lol"

"Jeremy grunts to Winston, and they open the back of the car. One by one, crates of moonshine are removed. Once the unlicensed, high alcohol content haul is out they look to Loc. Jeremy is the one to talk.

They shove Loc out, hand him a loaded revolver, and hopped back in the vehicle to turn it around. They then take out materials that had been stashed in the car to make some makeshift camouflage. It in no way would stand up to scrutiny, but it could but a couple moments.

For a few minutes nothing happens, but then a cop walks by. Seeing Loc out in the open with the crates, he comes up to talk. Winston gestures forward to Loc while the cop talks, indicating to move the policeman further into the alley.

"Prosperity in the EU? That's rewriting history somewhat. 10 years after the recession, 3 of the 4 largest eurozone economies still had unemployment above 10%. Even at the height of the recession unemployment never reached 10% in this country. The EU was too late implementing QE, that's why the eurozone went on to have a 2nd recession, including 4 of the 5 largest economies. The US and UK implemented it early and avoided a 2nd recession. 

Then they had the eurozone debt crisis where Greece nearly started another recession by threatening to default. And they seem to have moved backwards on a US trade deal, which was one of the main reasons the EU was created in the first place.

I was following the international markets closely at the height of the recession and eurozone crisis and it's absolute fantasy to portray the EU as economically competent. They were a global laughing stock for most of the last decade. Now they've lost one of their most important members and have a hole in their budget. Within a few years you'll be hearing all about the northern eurozone inflation crisis, set a reminder if you don't believe me."

"i think the main issue with games like WoW and FFXIV is that your progression doesn't feel hindered to make way for payed ""convenience"" options. I could very easily drop money to get gil in ffxiv and buy a full set of crafted gear to start out the patch. Or I could not and do just fine, I imagine it's the same for WoW.

In BDO for example, you have to purchase pets, inventory slots, inventory weight to even begin playing the game at a reasonable rate.(Fuck off people who say durrrr but you can play just fine without that shit.) Along with that silver in BDO is THE end all be all. You need silver for everything so things that mitigate silver costs and things that help you farm more efficiently are much more important. In WoW and FFXIV your progression is very static, you can only do so much content a week before your capped and need to wait for next week. In BDO your only limit is how much time you're willing to put in and how efficiently you farm.

Would BDO be a more fun and better game if pets were bought from an npc for silver(not this auction house sniping stuff) and you didn't have such limited space/weight? I don't think there's anyone who would argue against these things. They are awful practices that saddest part is they design a fairly fun game, but then choose this business model. Some people like it some don't, but to me they can go fuck themselves it's just excessive.

In my opinion as an ffxiv player the gear and items don't bother me so much as cash shop exclusives, I hate having stuff that you can only get with real money I pay a fucking sub and buy your full priced game every 2 years for godsake. I will get my gear set just by doing my weekly raids."

"I am not really a fan of TTH on Amazoness, because the deck already run other traps. But you should run whatever works for you. If TTH proves to be bricky on your drck, I would recommend you to replace it by a different trap (like another Canadia, Widespread Ruin, Floodgate, Wall of Disruption, etc.)

As someone else already said, I also recommend you to replace Fighting Spirit by Willpower. It's searchable by princess too, and you can get it if you already drawed Onslaught. When you use Endless Trap Hell, it's generally a good idea to have as much traps as possible.

For reference, here's the Amazoness deck that I use: https://i.imgur.com/VkgGwoQ.png

It's worth noting that I have Amazoness Scouts in order to protect me from destruction effects, like TTH, Donpa, Yubel; it can be useful but it's not strictly necessary. Another uncommon Amazoness that may help is Amazoness Spy, it can be easily special summoned so it can perform a similar role than the currently semi-limited Baby Tiger. On the top of that, Spy can also retrieve an Amazoness from the grave if destroyed by battle, which you can special summon right away if you have Onslaught. I would use Spy on a Holy Guard build, since you have more freedom there to attack stuff with weaker monsters.

Those are just suggestions of alternatives for the deck, they are not mandatory. Amazoness decks can have a couple of variants, each of which can be good on their own ways."

"&gt; I mean what would be the middle ground. Allow any unaccompanied minor into the US? That would just incentive parents to do that? Especially when you include chain migration. 

The promise of chain migration is essentially why there is such a large current influx.  We should probably stop that.  

As a general rule, I'm all for taking in as many young children as we can handle.  Children raised here will have no integration issues.  I'd rather work out some sort of formalized system, rather than this ad-hoc nonsense through INS.  Some sort of government academy might work, as odd as that sounds.  But it'd have to compromise by saying ""no chain migration"" in order to prevent the perverse incentive that parents have now to send their children.

I remember a few years ago, there were a bunch of these assholes who actually protested at a bus of guatemalan *children* who were being transported to a facility that could take care of them.  They protested at the *children.*   That is crazy.   It's not the kids' fault.  "

And it should be the whole package - from the opening montage through the closing credits. Graphics, music, camera crew, announcers, producer, director, the whole works is that franchise's TV crew.

That’s not as efficient as a single integrated monolith but it did maintain the crucial relationship between track and train and it better reflected costs than the original  railways directives rules.

"**SR 3/3**

#Section 4: [THIS Contingency!](https://youtu.be/ekWbliUNqfM)


**Buffalo goes down:** If in immediate danger of being retired herself, Mute will run and shrink herself down when out of sight and go with a stealth plan to take out and evade being retired. If not she can continue to take out whoever her target is while running away. She will then grab a sharp object from one of the nearby stores, such as a fork, knife, or screwdriver, expanding it at B SPD to stab her enemies. If needed, a blunt weapon can be made instead. She will go for opportunistic hit and run tactics while they try to find her and occasionally shrink down for stealth purposes.  


**Mute goes down:** Buffalo will set up on the roofs or run to the parking lots on either side for cover. He can also duck into stores and go out the other wall by using oases. The match from then on becomes essentially a battle of attrition and keepaway, with Buffalo sniping at them from afar and travelling along rooftops and other terrain only he can traverse.


**If Damon doesn’t get retired in the beginning:** We will focus him and his stand and stock more up on ATs to use. We will also take to traveling more along the roofs so if he ever wants to position swap, he will have to deal with added gravity on the roof. 


**If we can’t get away in the beginning,** we can still fight them as is with WWW to delay their offense and falling back ASAP.


**If Damon somehow swaps with us at any point,** Mute will likely be swapped while on her skateboard if it does happen, so now Damon will have to quickly get off with heavier gravity or end up falling off. Buffalo can shoot things from a prone position and force Damon into one if he position swaps him like that. SR’s high AGI will help them deal with the disorientation and by keeping track of Damon’s position that can help with knowing where they end up.

**If HoH attempts to change clothes/ hair style,** we will be watching out for their stands the most and can use that extra time for set up. Destiny’s afro will take him longer to change effectively.

You are welcome like you said because of the number of students it may be difficult to book an appointment with the lecturers but they will always respond to the questions in your email - it could take even longer due to lower staff morale and they may not be as energetic when giving feedback. \[They could say your answer is in page 57 and move on to the next email\]. 

Another possibility: Since their ranking has dropped there may be less international applicants applying for Computer Science so it's possible that student numbers as well tutorial class sizes decreases. The lecturers themselves have more time to answer your question. 

As for AUT their lecturers place greater importance in answering student emails because they have a more friendly culture that enourages their lecturers to actively engage with their students as much as possible. They inceased from the top 600 to top 350 in two years so they probably have overwhelming staff morale. I think AUT has always had a good staff morale ever since they were granted university status. \[Though this is probably not true for the Arts and Humanities department because they cut 40 jobs this year which scared their Arts/Humanities staff into thinking they don't have good job security and may give half an ass to answer student conerns regarding that paper\]  

Every organisation has it's flaws and everything is subject to change. AUT's flaw is that it's teaching material has never been too good, but they have really caring lecturers to make up the differences. I personally don't think AUT can reach any higer than top 350 they are more likely to stay at that rank or even drop a little. UoA will not drop any further and their computer science is in the top 250 while AUT is not even in the list. AUT might be better for learning experience but UoA might be better for your career as it places more importance on theory \[it is because of this their computer science is in top 250\] and you can always pick up practical skills on your own.

"Cuando tenía 8-9 años estaba toda la onda esta de voces anónimas y en la clase estabamos todos colgados con los espiritus, fantasmas, etc. De pocas cosas que me acuerdo es una vez que me quedé esperando a mi viejo hasta tarde en la escuela y estabamos nomás el portero y yo. El portero me pidió que cierre la puerta del patio que estaba lejos de cualquier persona y cuando la estaba cerrando sentí que alguién me tocó la espalda, me giré pensando que era mi viejo pero no había nadie. Después otra vez estabamos jodiendo con unos amigos haciendo algo parecido al juego de la copa y no me acuerdo como fue que terminé mirando un cuadro de una virgen y recuerdo no poder sacar la mirada del ese cuadro, clavada la vista, tremendo cagazo me agarré.
Cabe destacar que era un edificio muy antiguo que a veces cuando estaba oscuro era hasta tétrico."

I feel for you sweetie. My ex-mother-in-law threatened to have me declared an unfit mother simply because she hated the fact that I was with her son. She hated me from the minute she met me simply because she felt like I was taking her little boy away from her according to her. She did the same kind of stuff to me. She came to the hospital while they were inducing my labor and they had pulled the curtains around my bed and they told her do not come through the curtain we are doing procedure because they were in the middle of giving me pitocin and she tried to come through the curtain anyway and so they had to repeat it. This bitch waited all of about 10 seconds before she came through the curtain anyway and said I'm the grandmother. When they asked her to leave or she would be escorted out by security she acted shocked and couldn't understand what the big deal was. She spent my entire labor talking about how she wanted to go to the bar because it was Wednesday night and that was her usual night for going to the bar and I found out that she was trying to give my mother who was coaching me through the entire 21 hour labor Xanax to calm her nerves. This dumb bitch was dumb enough to do that right in front of doctors and nurses and could have been arrested. When my mom went in my bathroom to change out the wash cloth that was on my forehead she said she walked in there to find this bitch fixing her make-up instead of trying to help me. She was probably trying to land her gold-digging ass a doctor. Now my son is 12 and she claims that my mother did not try to help me on that in fact my mother was not even there. I said bitch are you just so doped up on pills you don't remember or are you going into Dementia or something? I said my mother was there the entire time but you're the one who left and went home to go to sleep because you were so pilled out on Xanax you couldn't even stay awake and when your son tried to call you to tell you that I was starting to push you said you would be there but ended up falling back to sleep. My mom asked him where is your mother and so he called her again and she said oh I'm sorry I fell asleep and then acted pissy because she got woken up. I have so many stories I could write a book on her psycho ass. She came to the hospital after I had him and walked in and he was holding our baby and she said can I hold him and when he said no because I had not held him yet she acted pissy because he wouldn't let her hold him. He said it is very important that he Bond with me because I was his mother and she acted like that was unimportant and acted wounded because he refused to let her hold him before me. Like I said this bitch is crazy.

"Karazhan and SSC as holy priest because it was my first introduction to raiding and just really fun in general. 

Raiding ICC as shadow priest and finally killing the Lich King was also really cool and it felt like I was really pulling the most out of my class.

All-time favourite is probably Karazhan just because it was my first raid and I really enjoyed BC where everyone sucked at the game and information wasn't as widely available as today (Atleast to me). Everything was still mysterious back then. Also the non-split hero/normal mode was really nice. Many people didn't even see things beyond Karazhan so it felt really cool to finally reach the point with your character where you could do these things. Progression was meaningfull because it allowed you to see things you otherwise wouldn't. On the flipsite no one said ""I pay a subscription each month I should be able to see Black Temple""."

"I do a range of hip stretches. I think the key thing is consistency and time under the stretch. Treat it like a workout, do these stretches every 2-3 days and hold each stretch for a minimum of 90 seconds. For me, if it feels good, I hold for 3 minutes per stretch. That way the muscle you're stretching actually does what you want it do to and will begin to lengthen and become more flexible. But you must allow plenty of time for the muscle to recover.

"Seasonals, like alternative characters. 

For example, if you roll for Legendary Tiki, you'll also have a chance to get Micaiah, which is fine as she has a chance to appear as a pity breaker on a regular banner OR appear on a ""theme"" banner that appears later on.

However, Seasonal characters only appears on the seasonal banners. The other blue unit is Spring Catria. This is Catria in a spring costume, meaning she'll only appear again on a banner during the spring time rerun, and will not pity break you. 

In the long term you want to merge characters to make them ""+10"" so they can be the most useful to you. 

Of course if you don't care about +10, then the Legendary heroes banners are all pretty stellar to roll on."

"You’re welcome Missy. 

I agree she appears deceptive. I also agree she appears to be a survivor of trauma. Ford has gone through something, we just don’t know what it was. For all we know, it could have been incest. Given her family’s DS background, it is anyone’s guess as to what she has endured. She may have had to survive similar abuse to Nicole Kidman. 

My guess is she is being used by handlers with an agenda. She may even believe some of what she is reporting. She doesn’t believe it all however. That much is clear. 

I watched some of a video on YT discussing her nonverbals. I have to say I disagree with much of what was stated by the person analyzing Ford during her testimony. Ford’s nonverbals tell a definite story but not as the YT video states. 

As for someone who might look to others to provide her with answers, someone being handled, someone heavily medicated, someone in deep legal doo-doo, or someone who is mentally incompetent. "
"Since you haven’t heard about it, I don’t think you’ve seen the backlash Ford has been getting online. It’s tremendous. My entire town is up in arms about this subject; there’s a reason there never is any accusations in my town and it’s because no one, or very few people like myself, would believe them or at least give the benefit of the doubt. I’ve heard of girls being turned away from police, here, too. 

Look up the #WhyIDidntReport trending thing. I think that helped open my eyes a little more. 

When people go through traumatic things, they don’t always process it logically or understand what was happening and what they should do next. We shouldn’t criticize victims because we think they didn’t do the 100% right thing before, during, or after, or what we think we would’ve done in the situation (which is irrelevant, since most people don’t know how they’re really going to react until it happens to them). 

If you have any questions feel free to ask. :)

"For traits, armor is pretty easy and steady throughout different metas - Divines, Infused, Sturdy for tanks, and Impenetrable for PvP. Training isn't bad to know as long as some character on your account is actively leveling. Then probably Reinforced and Well-Fitted. 

Weapon traits are a bit more volatile - I'm not sure what's currently the meta-est, but Infused, Decisive (somewhat more for tanks?), Charged, Nirnhoned (expensive!), Sharpened, and Precise have all had their heydays. Training also isn't bad to know here either. That leaves Powered and Defending as the remainder which you rarely see recommended. 

If you've got Jewelry Crafting, I believe the winners here are Bloodthirsty, Swift, and Infused, which are all relatively pricey since it's still fairly new. 

As for the system... the best way to level it is to Deconstruct *everything* you pick up (that you aren't going to use). Actually making stuff doesn't get you a ton of crafting XP. You can also do Daily writs that give a fair chunk (after being certified by crafters in the Fighter and Mage's Guild of your Alliance's starting city - possibly in Vivec and Alinor too, though I'm not sure). 

[Here's an in-depth write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/3yrszn/workshop_wednesday_give_crafting_tips_offer/cyg8a94/) about the system itself; the gist is to deconstruct *everything* you pick up that you don't intend to use, and start researching traits ASAP as the number of traits known controls what sets you can craft.

Doing that without one of humanities most basic inventions is an incredible achievement.

Cool. As. Fuck), and b) actual human beings.

"Charge as much as you possibly can for rides.  Add a few extra ride sequences to your flat rides which increases prestige/rating which increases how much you can charge.  With 2 sequences, you can charge $15 for the Ferris wheel.  For flat rides and coasters, you can charge anywhere between $15-$30.  Definitely take advantage of tracked rides, they print money.    
Make sure to get your queue and ride scenery at its max too if you can.  That increases their prestige and your park rating which = more guests spending more money on them.  You can also typically charge $3-$5 more for stalls with extras.  Just experiment with the pricing of things.  If they complain, lower them and if not raise them.  

If you need a surge in cash, close down all your rides (not your park) and your guests will storm your stalls and then leave.  Once they're nearly cleared out, open all your rides again and you'll get a bunch of new guests with full cash.  "

"I'll put forth a contrary view. 

Where I live in the US it's possible to be a consistent consumer, and spend a bit to support lefty news orgs/etc, if you have a middle-class income. I've been all over the income spectrum and it takes a minimum of about $15-$20 an hour here to really be consistent about all your consumption habits and avoid the worst actors in our system. Most people make far less than that and it isn't really possible to be a hundred percent consistent if you do, let alone if you have a health problem or any dependents. The margins are just too thin to allow a meaningful change in consumption at most people's income. 

When it comes to transportation, in most places here using public transit alone is impossible for 90% of people outside of city centers in large metropolises, and it takes dedication to use a motorcycle/bicycle/walk etc rather than use a car. Et al. 

While things vary across the country, I think leftist people who are below the comfortable middle-class in Europe (and Scandinavia in particular) have an easier time remaining consistent in their consumption habits than Americans. 

Now, if you do absolutely *everything* possible to maximize efficiency- tracking your daily calorie needs and buying just enough fair trade produce, living next to your job, walking five miles to or from a bus stop every day, et al- you probably could live consistently on $10 an hour. But I think imposing that level of monasticism on people is beyond impractical. If you can manage it, great, but it shouldn't be demanded from every leftist as some kind of test- that's what the right loves to throw at us to discredit valid points the left makes. "

"Okay “kid” lol. I’m fine with them earning as much as possible. But you see, there’s this stipulation called a “salary cap” and when a team like the Steelers or Texans get stuck paying $15M to a player who is underperforming, that really hurts their ability to compete. 

If you want players making eight figure salaries fully guaranteed, maybe campaign to raise the salary cap by a factor of ten. Then I’d be fine with Bell’s handling of the situation. But as it stands, I’m a Steelers fan, not a Bell fan. If Bell goes out and puts up 800 rushing yards two years in a row, I don’t want him on the team anymore and I don’t want us cutting him $15M checks. Sorry, but he isn’t **earning** that money at that point. Why does he deserve it if he isn’t earning it?

If mike evans comes out and demands a renegotiation because OBJ got a bigger contract, youd be okay with that?  Hes played great, on pace for his best year yet, should he be maximizing his value? Maybe JPP says he deserves more because hes averaging a sack a game but hes being paid based on getting 8-9 sacks. Leveon is the outlier because hes being abused with the franchise tag.  The guys who have contracts and want new contracts... that bothers me.  Theyll have an opprtunity to change things at the next collective bargaining agreement."

"The Dark Knight Rises was a movie that had substantial hype and following for four years and was billed as the conclusion of the Nolan Trilogy. The Dark Knight was massively successful critically and commercially and was even up for a number of academy awards.

Comparing the two is hilariously fallacious and biased. A trailer trending means little to nothing as many weren't even sure this was coming out. Venom, for example, was trending but had low initial guidance and Fant4stic was trending as well and ended up being a complete bomb."

"Then make it a mid-budget horror game. I think we're finally moving past the ""every game must be $60"" phase that plagued a lot of the industry. In fact, the primary complain people had with Alien: Isolation is that it was too bloated - in an attempt to ward off ""game is great but too short, wait for a sale"" comments, the devs bloated the game with like 40% more length than it needed.

Make an Alien: Isolation sequel at half the length and charge $40 and bam, you've got a winner. They already have the AI and graphical assets (which honestly still look FANTASTIC and don't need to be updated). It won't push CoD numbers, but not every game needs to.

"I used to send my child to an independent school before we switched to government schooling. My wife and I were members of the not-for-profit association which was the legal entity of the school. So we saw the annual accountant-certified financial reports.

The situation is, the non-government school sector, which educates more than one and a quarter million students across Australia, is mostly dependent upon government funding to remain a going concern. Regardless of whatever moral account anyone wants to make of it, that is the reality.

If the government were to stop funding non-government schools tomorrow, where would you educate the more than 1.25 million students who would be without a school within a year? You'd have to build literally thousands of new schools within a single year to handle that capacity.

Or...you could continue to fund the already-existing schools which educate them.

That's the choice the government makes. It's less costly to continue to fund existing schools than it is to put almost a third of existing schools out of business and build new ones to replace them."

"It is possible to do human drafting at your own pace, but devs refuse to take a cue from other games.

Eternal, a different card game, stores your draft pick in their servers, and when someone else plays draft, they get your pack! They choose a card and the pack goes back to the server until someone else does draft, make 2 picks, and they will get your pack after their 2nd pick! Now you have fully human drafting system that does not require you to make a pick within a set time limit. The servers simply store all the packs with picks made by human players at varying stages of all drafts. And all players can take all the time in the world with their selection because there is already a huge library of draft packs to be assigned to new players even if you never finish your draft. There's always one available for someone.

The first and third packs will be selected by the same person before they pass their packs to the server before the server gives them to you. The second and fourth packs are chosen by a different individual. The system is perfect for what I need in draft."

"I went today with my wife. Been gaming for years but this was our first convention. I'll put my brief review here to join your excellent one if you don't mind!

Firstly, the venue was splendid. Alexandra Palace (known affectionately as Ally Pally) in London just oozes Victorian charm but with plenty of modern amenities to make you comfortable - including more eateries than you can shake an artisanal baguette at. The high ceilings of the Great Hall with the immense organ (heh) at the end added a grand aesthetic to the game playing experience. Being reasonably central in London it's great for public transport, but we chose to come by car and use the free parking onsite. I do hope the convention is at the same place next year.

There were basically four areas of the convention. The 'main event' was in the Great Hall, where dozens of publishers, designers and retailers had set up their stalls and demo tables and let you play and buy their wares. Some stalls were straight up retail affairs, but the majority had tables for you to try before you buy. In a few large areas patrolled by the Asomodee Army (as we came to call them) there wasn't even any pressure to buy, as they weren't there selling directly. Seriously I don't think I realised how big Asomodee are until seeing them in action. I don't mean that in a negative way, everyone who spoke to us and taught us games were super friendly.

The Great Hall was... Well, great! The prices were slightly dearer than online but without shipping of course so not much in it. Much more valuable was the ability to playtest titles, which we spent most of our time doing. One thing I would say is there seemed to be a large number of stalls selling terrain and other stuff for miniatures games. I don't know if that's normal for cons (as I say, first one) but they didn't seem busy at all. Whereas the more board gamey ones were always busy, even though the convention itself was fairly quiet overall. I understand it was busier on the Saturday.

As for the other areas of the convention, we didn't go in them very much. There was a huge hall filled with empty tables where you could play your new acquisitions or borrow from a rather meagre looking games library. Inside this hall there was an area for seminars. We didn't want to commit to a whole hour-long talk, or appear rude by leaving halfway through one, so we avoided them. Looks like we weren't alone; they were sadly quite poorly attended from what we could see. Those who were sitting there looked like they were really getting into them though. The final area was a smaller hall for miniatures games, RPGs and competitive tournaments. None of these are our thing so I'll reserve judgement. I would say there was a HUGE table for some sort of war game with hundreds of units and intricate pieces of scenery which certainly looked impressive!

Onto the games! We LOVED Space Base, but bizarrely it wasn't on sale at the convention. I thought maybe it had sold out by Sunday but another guy I spoke to said it wasn't there on Saturday either. There's a lesson, find out what games Asomodee are bringing from their catalogue of thousands and let the retailers know! But yeah, really enjoyed that one. It made us think of Splendor, with its three rows of cards to buy and its engine building feel, but with dice play that sort of gives you a Catan vibe (roll dice, get stuff, watch for other people's dice rolls to get stuff too) and plenty of unique mechanics which all added up to a game we enjoyed far more than the ones I've mentioned and I'm keen to play again. Ended up ordering it online on our way home.

Then Patchwork Express. I've heard of Patchwork of course but never had the chance to play it. Not sure I'll bother now because of how much we liked the Express version! We were taught it by another enthusiastic chap (who, as it later transpired, got a few rules wrong) and then played it twice all in about half an hour. Yet despite the quick playtime, it was a deeply engaging and tense experience. With the minimal set up / tear down time we thought it was absolutely perfect for a weeknight after getting the kids to bed and you just want to sneak in a board game quickie. We bought it on the spot.

I'm afraid I didn't get on with Keyforge as much as the OP. We only played once, with a deck each of course. For those that don't know, it's a bit like Magic but the decks are semi-randomly generated and instead of trying to kill the other player you're trying to accumulate amber to make keys. I usually like these kind of games and thought I'd really dig it, but in reality I just had hand of hand of cards that were either unplayable or mediocre at best. My wife had the same. It became an exercise in making the most out of rubbish hands of cards, trying to get rid of as many as possible in the hope that drawing again up to your hand limit will bring you a killer play... Which never quite happened. Maybe we were just terrible at it. Maybe we got an unlucky deck match up. Maybe my expectations were too high. I don't know. The best thing about playing Keyforge for me was learning that I will save a few pounds in Q4 this year because it's not for me.

Luxor was a very enjoyable way to spend 45 minutes or so. OP did a great write up which I agree with so I won't say much else, other than it wasn't quite special enough to warrant a purchase for us. Still a good game, but with limited shelf space (and funds) that's just not enough for us these days.

We lost horribly at The Mind. I don't know if anyone's played Racko but it made us think of a cooperative version of that. Playing it once was a fun and interesting experience but I don't see much replay value there, other than playing it with different groups. We also thought that with the majority of the game consisting of cards just marked 1-100 it would be the easiest game ever to do a print and play.

Last game we played was Happy Salmon with total strangers. It is not possible to play that game without a big stupid grin on your face. Instant purchase.

Wow, I've gone on way longer than I had planned to. Sorry about that. My final thoughts are that it was a really well-run convention that was a lot of fun and I really hope they do it again next year (back at Ally Pally!) Thank you organisers if you're reading!"

"&gt; Your formatting looks off.

Does it? How so? Hmm, I do see I wrote it wrong tho. I've corrected it. I changed `pointerToScalerPointer ~~&gt; pointerToScaler` which wasn't what I meant, to `pointerToScalerPointer ~&gt; pointerToScaler~` which points that variable to the reference (rather than what the reference points to).

&gt; ""how"" the pointer?

Corrected. I left of the word ""behaves"" at the end. 

I still don't see a way to do transparent references to references in Perl 6. You can certainly put references into array or some other explicit container, but then its no longer transparent. In Perl 6, how can you point variable `b` to variable `c`, and then point variable `a` to variable `b` such that if you change what `b` points to, it changes what value c is pointing to as well. I don't think you can do this with either assignment or binding - containers can't contain containers transparently. How would you do this in Perl 6?:

```
insertInto = fn array value:
  array.=ins[1] ; appends value to the array

var array1 = {}
var array2 = {}
var arrayForOdds ~&gt; array1
var arrayForEvens ~&gt; array2
var arrayToInteractWith ~&gt; arrayForOdds~
 
insertInto[arrayToInteractWith 1]
wout[array1] ; prints {1}
wout[array2] ; prints an empty list {}

arrayForOdds ~&gt; array1

insertInto[arrayToInteractWith 3]
wout[array1] ; prints {1}
wout[array2] ; prints {3}
```

This is as close as I got in Perl:

```
sub insertInto(@array, $value) {
    @array.append: $value;
};

my @array1 = ();
my @array2 = ();
my $arrayForOdds := @array1;
my $arrayForEvens := @array2;
my $arrayToInteractWith := $arrayForOdds;

insertInto(@array1, 1);
say @array1;  # prints [1]
say @array2;  # prints []

$arrayForOdds := @array2;
insertInto(@array1, 3);
say @array1;  # prints [1 3]
say @array2;  # prints []
```

The difference is that `arrayToInteractWith ~&gt; arrayForOdds~` means that `arrayToInteractWith` points to the pointer `arrayForOdds`. So that when what `arrayForOdds` changes, `arrayToInteractWith` also changes what array it will transparently reference.

Regarding the other, I don't see them saying that's how every woman should be, unless that's how you take all cultural conversation. They don't say it at all. And the fact that you said ""stay at home mom"" and ""married in her 20s"" means you get cancer right away suggests there's a popular tendency for the exact opposite, that to suggest traditionalism in any sort of way is literally morally wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal opinion on feminism is that it means women get to have free choice, but I feel like there's a lot of push back to a woman who would choose any of those things. You can't deny that on both sides, it's a matter of suggesting ""women should be like x"". If the author is saying that's how all women should be, then popular culture does suggest that women should be like the left girl, minus the obviously pejorative nature of the description.

And of all things that damn slippery slope argument, as if it will somehow lead to Republicans becoming worse than they already are. Newsflash, they already use every slimey underhanded tactic, this will not change that one bit, not a single iota. The only argument you are presenting is to stop fighting, to put your guns down and surrender, to just give up and fucking die and give the opposition everything they want because doing anything else apparently appears to you to be a crime against humanity.

Carol is a badass, don't get me wrong, but a lot of her actual growth happened between time jumps. And No Sanctuary was cool, but a huge leap in believability. 

Not to mention the way Madison and Luciana in particular have been treated this season."

"BOOM!!

Haha, that’s hilarious. It’s pretty close to how things went down fir my PC. The dwarf was a merchant but when he saw my PC start stealing from nobles he revealed his shop was actually a front for the thieves guild who were trying to make things better for the poor folk.

When my PC left the town he was separated from the dwarf. They were supposed to meet up after a while but when he didn’t show my PC had to find out what happened. He later learns the dwarf was captured by the nobles before he could leave, so my PC temporarily left the party to do a solo mission to rescue him.

During that time I had brief one-on-one sessions with the DM to determine what was happening with my Rogue’s mission. I created a Bard PC to join the party during this time, who was also one of my favourite PCs."

"BRS explained that when they created the Battle Royale mode that it would be impossible to keep the steampunk style art (framerate issues). 

We actually dont know how far the story mode is developed. It could be nearly done, but BRS switched gears a while back from creating story mode content and TDM content to Battle Royale content. Why did they do this? Because at the time it was a brilliant business decision. Remember that during the CJ funding stage last fall (2017) Fortnite issued a statement that they would not release Fortnite on Switch. This was a great opportunity to switch focus to Battle Royal (which clearly hadn't been worked on at the time of funding) and capture the Switch battle royale fans. 

Where the team failed to execute was in hiring the 10 developers right away to accomplish the monumental task of a BR game. This mistake could have had two causes. 1 - the brothers underestimated the task at hand or 2 - Not enough funding to hire the 10 developers that early in the process. I'd like to know which reason it was, but I probably never will."

"I don't know, you kind of get close with Haytham who's more of a Colonial James Bond, at least in the early parts of the game before you see how ruthless and cynical he's become. Edward also has some elements but I think he's a bit too rogue-ish in the beginning and it's only near the end do you begin to see his more charming and patient side. And then there's Jacob who can be pretty damn fun at times.

I think the series has fallen into a trap of only two character types, either the serious, business type (like Altair, Connor or Evie) and the fun, playboy types (like Ezio, Edward and Jacob). I feel Bayek is a mix between the two but still falls on the side of serious considering his character and that he's got a parent mindset.

"It’s only a disadvantage because of how bad the matchmaking is. If they’re going to make a competitive game mode available to teams of all sizes they have an obligation to attempt to balance that experience. 

Like I said I’d be fine restricting it to full teams too, or even coming out and saying outright that it’s an “at your own risk” situation, but they’ve never framed it that way. Instead they’ve explicitly stated their matchmaking is meant to take team size into consideration and balance for that advantage, so it’s at least partly on Bungie and not on the player by their own admission.

"In high school, I played at a national ranked school in a small town in the south. Our entire region was absolute trash. We'd beat every team by about 50-70 points. In order to be competitive nationally, we'd also schedule out of state powerhouses (St. Thomas Aquinas, Hoover, Miami schools). 



Starters would go out for the first drive of the second half and then we'd ride the bench the rest of the game. This allowed entire squads of freshmen to get into the game in the later 4th quarter. 


However, when playoffs would arrive, it was always a slag at first. We were really well conditioned, but there is nothing that compares to playing four full quarters of actually hard fought football.

"Why is intention more important then the action and the negative result? Predatory behavior isn't always dangerous it's exploitation of a known weakness in someone else. He likes her and she's not receptive to a romantic relationship but is receptive to having his attention every single day. She doesn't have trouble dealing with her emotions, she talks to him everyday for hours. They are two young people talking for hours everyday probably about their lives and things they enjoy talking about. That's an emotional exchange that she is comfortable having. She talks every day with a young man who is not accessible to her and vice versa. Having another conversation about .... I have no idea what your proposing other then him saying again that he likes her and her saying again that she's whatever excuse does absolutely nothing for anyone in this situation. The suggestion that not communicating would hurt her doesn't make sense either. She knows that she's only got his attention because of his desire for her and she's using that to milk him for a daily positive affirmation of her self worth. How come she's not on the phone for hours with girls from school everyday or other friends from school? Why doesn't she pour all this energy into another close friendship or a romantic relationship? Because it's a win win for her. She gets the emotional ego lift of having someone desire her and shower her with positive attention without being vulnerable in an actual romantic relationship. It's like having a fan or like I said before, like having a pet. They are not on the same emotional level. There is a huge power imbalance and it's not healthy for anyone involved."

"It may not have been a rejection by their adoptive family.  My sister in law lived in a group home for a while as a teenager because her behaviour was simply more than my mother in law could cope with.  It was a last straw after trying everything else she could think of.  Chipley may have ended up in the group home for similar reasons.  He'd clearly already had a difficult or unstable start to life and few, if any, kids are going to just instantly fit in and settle into a new life after adoption.  His adoptive parents may have underestimated his needs or been unable to manage his behaviour and thought a group home may have been able to help.  It doesn't mean they didn't want him anymore."

"Hey there!

I really appreciate you taking the time to offer up those suggestions! While I'm definitely no stranger to being on the road, I've never attempted a road trip at this caliber. The longest were a week long at most, just a few states over, but planning an essentially a year long journey is a different animal!

I'll keep the tips in mind, and some are definitely a good affirmation to some of the things I'm doing to prepare. 

Picking up a Jeep was deliberate as it's rugged and offers all the utility I need. I'll have a sleeping bag, tent, and air mattress in tow, and I also plan on adding a rack to the rear that can hold equipment like a 5 gallon jerry can for fuel. I'll be rigging up plenty of lights as well in case I get stranded at night and to make myself visible from space if needed ;). I hope to limit night driving if I can help it. Full size spare tire is standard as well so that's comforting. I'll also have a fairly comprehensive tool box with me - I wrench on my cars and motorcycles so knowing my way mechanically around a vehicle is helpful.

I know you cant prepare for everything, so I'm really glad you pointed out some sticky situations you fell into so I am equipped to avoid them! Cheers mate! "

"Thanks for the question!  The stability triangle (pyramid) is just something that one learns and takes for granted.

&amp;#x200B;

After some digging around this is what I found:

&amp;#x200B;

The forklift has three points of suspension.  The forklift is connected to the front two wheels and the rear pivot point.  This differs from a car where the weight is connected to all four wheels.  A car has a stability square as a result and a forklift has a stability triangle even though it has four wheels.  Considering the weights involved even when the forklift is unloaded those rear wheels really can't do much to stop the forklift from toppling over should the center of gravity leave the triangle.  Forklifts are \*heavy\* and the counterweights can be thousands of pounds easy.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't find any real documentation but I suspect that the extreme weight of that counterweight also contributes to the narrow end of the triangle in the rear.  It's center of gravity is most of the weight of the forklift and should its center of gravity shift it would have a far greater impact on the whole system.  I can't find hard documentation though.

&amp;#x200B;

The tipping point can be behind the wheels with the wheels acting just like a fulcrum.  If the center of gravity passes the front line of the triangle the forklift will tip forward on the wheels.  This can happen when the load is higher up on the pyramid but at normal operating heights the broad end of the triangle is the front axle (close enough).

&amp;#x200B;

When the load is lifted the center of gravity is also shifted upwards.  The lateral position of the center of gravity remains unchanged.  As the load height increases the cross section of the pyramid becomes smaller and smaller.  You could have a situation where the center of gravity is just fine when the load is low and then as the triangle decreases in size it passes outside said shrinking stability triangle and the forklift tips forward or if the load is moving or unbalanced the center of gravity passing over the other sides and the forklift topples over.  That's why you lift the load as little as possible when travelling.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopes this helps a little."

"This is partially true, but in the case of the Catholic Church, there is more to it. People join the Priesthood, generally, when they are about 13 years old. So that means complete abstinence from the age of 13 on, the very beginning of sexual discovery for most young people.
What happens when sexuality is suppressed completely from the very moment that you first start experiencing those feelings?
This is just my opinion, but I find it very coincidental that so many victims of clerical abuse are males around the age at which the abusers themselves entered the seminary. Having your own sexuality suppressed like that from such a crucial age must cause all kinds of warped thinking and issues.
EDIT: As per my comment replies, I am specifically talking about joining the Catholic Church in Ireland (Where I live) back in the 50's and 60's. Things are, I'm sure different now.

"Regardless of fake or not, I know people who get really pissed over people blocking crosswalks.

It just seems petty to really be that upset about it. It’s really not that big of a inconvenience to walk around in front of the car. 

This is especially true in cases where some people DO need to pull a bit passed the crosswalk to even see if it’s safe to turn. I myself have to this very often in places where I live because of a Bush, large tree, or what have you. 
Sure perhaps the car didn’t have that issue here and in those cases where it’s clear that the driver doesn’t NEED to pull that car forward to see if it’s safe I still feel even if they did block a crosswalk it really isn’t that big of a inconvenience. It’s not like those couple of feet are a safe zone protecting you from any and all vehicles. 

I feel all too often, even if a lot of people own a motor vehicle tend to forget to put themselves behind the wheel of another person’s car figuratively speaking. If they did we’d have less road rage and less people being petty over blocked cross walks.

"It is totally irrelevant. You would expect that if a class was ""bottom of the shit pit"" as you so eloquently put it, they would struggle killing basic mobs in the first place, therefore if you made them any worse (as you are suggesting levelling does) it would make that basic grind even harder and therefore more noticeable.

Since you want to misuse terse metaphors to attempt to make your point, imagine adding 10% more rungs to a ladder with 100 rungs, or 10% more rungs to a ladder with 10 rungs. Enhancement shaman climb 100 rungs to kill a mob, and if you add 10% they have another 10 rungs to climb. Your warlock takes 10 rungs to kill a mob, and if you add 10% it's only one more rung.

It's a ridiculous metaphor, and about as useful as the shit pit you mentioned earlier. None of it discounts the fact that the guy who is actually playing an enhancement shaman finds it easier to kill mobs at 119 than he did at 110, which anecdotally refutes your whining about how much harder the content gets as you level."

"Eh, considering the people in the south are just waiting for the government to try and the military loves their guns too and also heavily comes from the southern states it is really possible.

At least until the overall attitude towards guns really changes in the south.

Also keep in mind only about 10% of the population fought in the first civil war. It doesn't take many.

&gt;2.1 million — Number of Northerners mobilized to fight for the Union army

[https://www.history.com/news/civil-war-deadlier-than-previously-thought](https://www.history.com/news/civil-war-deadlier-than-previously-thought)

&gt;And consider that the American population in 1860 was about 31 million people, about one-tenth the size it is today. If the war were fought today, the number of deaths would total 6.2 million.”

I think you underestimate how many people love guns and distrust the government. At least right now. It is changing slowly.

"Your plan is very ambitious, but perhaps overly so.

More importantly, at such a low caloric intake, you need more protein to prevent muscle loss. R/psmf may have some useful information for you. 

I did 500-1100 calories daily for months and stuck to it. It meant supplements and lots of protein powder. It was also pretty miserable. Most people do not succeed at ultralow caloric intake and then they feel like failures. I recommend starting with a 30% caloric deficit and adjusting from there. Good luck!"

"Some people are just disasters when it comes to cooking. I don't know why, but my roommate in college was hopeless. She would try, but the only thing she ever managed successfully was boxed mac and cheese. It's hard for me to fathom, since I was making Mac and cheese from the earliest age my parents would let me operate the stove alone, and I've only vaguely followed recipes for years now and everyone I could for complements my meals. But there are other things they're good at that I suck at.

Maybe Lindsay is just one of those people who can't cook no matter how hard they try."

Yukine will turn into ayakashi after knowing god's greatest secret, and Yato will have to slay him.

Yato will die and reincarnate. Kofuku and Daikoku will raise him.

Hiyori will go visit little Yato every once in a while.

And yeah..
That would be the worst possible ending.

The best ending I could think of is Yukine remembering his past life and thinking 
Oh well, I'm with a better family now.
He doesn't turn into ayakashi.
Yato managed to kill father and doesn't die.
Amaterasu will grant Yato a wish and he wishes that he becomes human to live with hiyori a normal life.
But what would Yukine's fate be in that case?"

You can get better components for your $$ if you buy used but they can also be worn or in bad shape and end up costing you more in the long run.  

I’d recommend buying something around $700 and find out if mountain biking is your thing or not.  If you go too cheap then it may not be as fun of a ride and it could scare you out of biking.  You can always resell it if it isn’t for you and your risk is losing a few hundred dollars.  Good luck!"

And now I'm back home thinking, obsessing over the little things that annoy me in life and how my friend group pretty much split up the first day if school for no reason and I still have gifts for all of them sitting on my shelf that I can't give them anymore. And im jealous of them cos E is part of the cool group now and goes out drinking and partying, S has her other friends and D slid into another group so easily and I'm just kinda left wandering tryna fit in. They were my first real group if friends that helped me (tho they didn't know they were) with my social anxiety and depression.

 Also, I can't talk to my parents about my problems bcos the only thing important to them is my grades so at home I'm stuck studying 2 hours a night 10 months before exams. 

My other best friend has his own problems that I help him with as much as I can but I have to deal with the stress of helping him. I know that sounds bad and he's my best friend and I love him but he doesn't know I have problems too or if he does he doesn't believe they are as important as his.

And I can't sleep. I'm getting an average 5hrs sleep a night now. I try to sleep but I just can't and I don't know why. 

And I wanna cut myself again. I know its not good for me but it helps me relieve stress but I don't have a knife or razor and I just end up feeling stressed an worried all the time.

"I feel like you have no option but to let her go.  I say this for two reasons.

1) Your nanny did in fact steal the money and therefore should be fired. 

2) You ask your nanny about the missing money and she denies taking it.  At this point, if your nanny is innocent, you've probably offended her, and tainted the relationship.  Additionally, if the nanny denies taking the money, do you think you could believe her?  Or do you think you and your spouse would have a hard time fully trusting her?

I guess to me it sounds like the trust has been ruined.  And that you and your wife will never be fully comfortable with this nanny again.  That said, trapping her with a hidden cam, or lying that you have proof, sounds like a horrible idea.  Especially because you don't know that she took it.  

Sorry you've found yourself in this position.  That really sucks."
"This is ridiculous.  I'm getting frustrated just reading these ridiculous comments.

Original premise:  You are not allowed to break into someone's home without probable cause, shoot them, and then say it was OK because it TURNS OUT they are a criminal.  In other words, you cannot justify a crime retroactively.

Your premise:  If you have probable cause you are allowed to break into someone's home.  If there is a reasonable threat of harm or death, lethal force is then allowed.  This is IMMATERIAL to the conversation at hand.  

You're literally ignoring the original premise and inserting conditions *that did not exist*.  You're taking one conversation and turning it into a *different* conversation.  You ignored the situation that was being discussed and created a *new* situation.  I don't know how many times it has to be explained.

And the worst part is, you're taking people's responses as a disagreement to your premise when in reality they are rejecting your premise as immaterial to the discussion.  

You are correct in your stated facts, but are completely deaf to the context of the current discussion."

My point was the gene pool isn't pure as it is, and as time goes on, it's going to get less and less pure. There isn't a way to purify the gene pool, only dilution. Unless interbreeding comes into effect, which I think can be agreed is much more detrimental than interracial breeding.

"Its more than scary, health issues like that can be psychologically devastating. The sobering reality of life-altering illness and many medical treatments can make people desperate or worse - blindly hopeful. 

Lets face it, there are plenty of drugs and legitimate medical treatments out there with side effects ranging from worrisome to horrifying. And the overall healthcare system in the US is truly garbage. You wait weeks for an appointment and hours in the waiting room for a doctor to seemingly only half-listen to your symptoms for 5 minutes before making his diagnosis and pushing you out the door with a prescription and getting the next patient in. That's if you have decent insurance or can afford thousands in medical bills. 

I know that's a pessimistic way of looking at things, but that's how things felt going through a major health scare for me. I'd never fall for alternative medicine bullshit, but being in that situation, it wasn't hard to see how people can turn away from medical treatments and seek or be lured into bullshit in their vulnerable state.

"I disagree with this on a fundamental level. The world is not so simple that we can break it down into a binary yes or no answer. Let’s say there is a man accused of breaking and entering into a restaurant or something. Let’s say he is an employee who is taking stock in the basement. The lawyer asks him “were you there at the time the crime was committed?” It is absolutely stupid that we don’t allow them to say “yes, because I work there- as can be told be backed up by the official work schedule”. Yes he gets “his turn” later, but it makes him look significantly worse till he gets to the point and there is the chance that given he doesn’t have a lawyer that he would forget to address that accusation. 


I’m not saying this applies here, I’m saying your implication that not wanting to say yes or no means you are hiding something is very often wrong and actually one of the most annoying things about a court case"

I have one kid and like being a mom so much I am pregnant with my second now. I would not consider my first kid's birth at all ""traumatic"" and there was no ""agony"". During labor, I had an epidural, and I would definitely recommend asking for an epidural early on to keep the pain under control. My honest opinion is that it is kind of stupid to attempt birth without an epidural, just like I wouldn't have surgery without anesthesia. Sure, you CAN survive surgery without anesthesia, but why do it if you have a choice?

After birth, my vag was a little sore, but it was not that bad. I did not even take the pain medication they offered me because it didn't seem necessary.

Sure, there is bleeding after birth, but if you can cope with having a period, you can cope with that. It's really not a big deal, and it doesn't last forever. It starts off heavy and then slowly gets lighter.

I didn't have any problems with postpartum depression. Newborns do require a lot of care, but my husband and I were able to work out a system where we took shifts. One of us would stay up with the baby while the other slept, so we both were able to get rest. It gets easier as the kid gets older.

I'm not saying you have to have a bio kid, but it's not always going to be a dramatic or horrible experience. If it was really THAT bad, you wouldn't see so many people having multiple kids. Being pregnant is not my favorite thing, but I am having another kid because it's worth it to me. I am not at all scared of labor this time, since the first one was really not bad at all."

"The other responses telling you to give the ""I want to talk to your manager"" schpiel are simply incorrect. Telling someone you have a gun is not the same thing as brandishing. It may be *debatable* in court but this argument would need to be made by an attorney. The cops are not going to procure a search warrant to investigate the legality of a handgun that no one has seen and may or may not exist in New York, New York. 

To answer your actual question, yes you should get an attorney to mediate further communications.

Please stop trying to act tough in front of your wife with your ""Listen mother fucker"" attitude and brandishing (not in the legal sense) of a weapon yourself. This is absolutely the worst thing you can do. If you end up in a legal battle, this stuff can easily be exaggerated to make the claim that you were trying to intimidate him and he had no choice but to stand up for himself and inform you that he was carrying. And you are going to have a tough time proving that he entered your home with a gun in the past considering you didn't know it yourself until now.

Your Linguistics background will certainly set you apart and it will be a bonus for when you apply. And lots of people from non-business backgrounds apply for MBAs. But yeah, some of the biggest things you get out of an MBA are a strong network, lifelong connections (chos!), and the opportunity to (eventually) transition into a six-figure salary...it’s what a lot of people bank on. Me personally, I’m applying for an MBA because it’s always something I’ve had at the back of my mind.

If you are set on doing an MBA though, I’d suggest researching schools and seeing which one works best for you. In Asia, NUS/SMT are ranked competitively. Singapore also has INSEAD which is actually from France. 

If you’re particularly driven, you can look at the fancy US schools like Wharton, Booth, Harvard, Kellog, Anderson (UCLA I think), Yale, and others, which are harder to get into (and the average GMAT score required to stay competitive is much higher). Canadian schools like Ivey, Rotman, Schulich, Queens, Desautel, and Sauder are also decent options and the first few I mentioned are pretty high up there in global rankings. 

One thing with MBAs is you will need work experience. Doesn’t have to be managerial though! Most schools have a 2yr minimum, but the average is 4-6 years for most people getting their MBAs. PM me if you want to talk about it as I’m going through the process myself. :)"

"I tried both until I settled for the Air II so I might be biased. The only thing the Solo has over the Air in my experience is the heat up time. In terms of ""strength"" I didn't notice much of a difference between the two.

I feel like both device perform better with long and slow draw. Technically, the Solo heater should keep up with your draw better than the Air, but I never noticed the Air really lacking power to keep up with the draw.

In the end, initial heat up time doesn't matter much to me with a session vape. If I want to get lifted quickly, I'll use another vape because they're both kind of a sipper anyway. If you'd prefer a vape that packs a punch, I'd look for a different vape.

I'm not saying I don't like them or that they're bad in any way. You'll get where you want to go with either no questions asked. I still use my Air often. I'm just wondering if strength is a big factor for you (maybe even the main factor?) then you could be happier with a different vape."

"I don't have direct experience w/ VMX. But i mean, generally speaking all of that should work.

It really comes down to what you want your traffic to do. In the simplest terms, if youre fine with site A to B traffic going directly over the AutoVPN tunnel then thats OK.

But if you, for any reason, want traffic going from A to B to first flow through the AWS VPN before getting to B, you'll have issues. This type of scenario is typically easy to do on something like ASA, you can just tell the traffic where you want it to go. 

On MX, you'll have to get weird with your dashboard. For some larger organizations, thats not an option. "

"Anyone considering OLED should fully inform themselves. Don't just listen to these sales pitches. OLED is, or can be, a good product but two things are rarely mentioned about it, by the main pushers of this product. The first one being the ABL function. A function that cannot be disabled, that comes with every OLED TV, which basically ""handicaps"" the product by limiting the max brightness quite severely. This function exists mainly to slow product degradation which, to be fair, is something LED TVs suffer from as well, but are even more prominent with OLED.

The second one being overall brightness levels of OLED TVs which are sub-par at best, which means bright room viewing is, or can be, an unpleasant experience for most people.

Those are the 2 main issues to consider. There's also of course the infamous ""burn-in"" risk, which is way overblown but still something to keep in mind since all OLEDs do get minor image retention at times, which might be annoying to some folks. Then there's the issue of LG's customer service, which is absolutely shameful and that's putting it mildly.

To summarize, inform yourself thoroughly before jumping on the OLED bandwagon. 

*This post was by no means meant to unfairly malign OLED. I own a C7, my brother has a Sony OLED. It's a good product but it does have downsides, and I personally prefer to game on my 1500 nit FALD TV, which is perfectly watchable even when the sun is shining directly in my living room, or when all of the lights are on at night.*"

"The comparison to ethical theories was my own creation, no surprise you never heard that.  Did you have thoughts on the merits of the comparisons?

Next, I am not retelling the propaganda of fascism.  I posted the definition of it by the man who invented it, reading Mussolini’s thesis on fascism is no different than reading Marx’s manifesto or Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations”, it is important to define go to primary documents in order to study it.

My saying that I can see the theoretical appeal of fascism *is not me being fooled into advocating it*!  I can also see the theoretical appeal of Communism which has had an *exponentially greater cost to human life* and created far greater suffering for many more years than fascism.

Identifying and understanding *what* about an extreme ideology appeals and seduces otherwise rational people into following them *is absolutely critical to fighting the resurgence of them*!  How can one defend against it if they cannot even understand what would make someone support it!?

You have to be objective and go beyond “this is evil so I refuse to consider it” if you wish to understand these things.

Oh, and resoundingly no, I am not a fascist.  I am a (philosophical) libertarian with pragmatically centrist political views which makes me about as diametrically opposed in ideology to fascism as a person can be.

I want to say it was Chomsky who proposed a very illuminating explanation of the counter-intuitive appeal of fascism to the dispossessed and exploited (paraphrasing):

“While communism and socialism promise to the proletariat in his struggles equity, security and the comfort of relief from their exploitation, fascism offers them struggle, hardship, and even death.  The reason so many find the latter more appealing is that it also abstracts the world into simple and easily defined order and purpose for them and removes the need for the individual to worry or attempt to derive meaning, all that is required to “understand” the world is unquestioning adherence to the party’s dogma; a reduction of the world to a virtuous struggle for triumph over their imagined enemies.”"

"In addition to what ArsikVek said, consequences don't have to be static. When you treat a consequence, you rename it to show that it is in the process of being healed. A \[Broken Arm\] severe consequence could turn into \[Arm In A Sling\] while it gets better, or even \[Massive Favor Owed to the Temple\], if your arm was magically healed by priests.

The nature of the consequence can change; the only important thing is that it sticks around for a while as something to compel and cause trouble. Every time you compel it, it reminds everyone of something that happened in the game, and reinforces that the world is real and believable."

"I started out in the graphic design world working for clients then private firms. Here’s the thing...

You like to be creative, but a graphic designer is generally trying to “create” someone else’s vision. This can be difficult to make it as enjoyable as it would be with raw creativity.

Here’s an alternative to consider.

I went from graphic design to marketing &amp; sales.

I now create my own products, including the design and marketing for my products and sell them online using all kinds of great avenues, blogging, social media, YouTube, and affiliate influencer traffic &amp; email marketing,

When you are working as a graphic designer you are trading time for dollars.

So $10/hr at 8 hrs = $80 for example 
You hit a ceiling because there are so many hours in your day you can be paid for.

Contrast this to something you create and sell.

My products are digital “how-to” guides and courses on topics I know about.

Maybe yours is a T-shirt that you designed and want to share with the world (sell the sht out of).

Doesn’t matter what the product is... just think “product” vs time. “Units” vs minutes.

The reason is while time is limited, “units of product” can be sold and scaled infinitely.

While there are only 24 hrs a day you can get paid $10/hr for...

You can sell 24 T-shirt’s or copies of an ebook within an hour, even minutes. With the right “marketing” and setup you can sell 100+ units of a $20 product a day, every day.

My personal record is 100 units sold in 60 seconds at live time and 6,000 total units on single product, I’ve have 100+ different products over the years.

You can scale units infinitely as long as you have the process in place and you pour fuel on the fire when it’s started.

In your specific position with experience in blogging... you could use blogging as a platform to sell your products and use as the key traffic source for your business.

When you can drive traffic, this is huge and especially if you have a blog where you can build a story around the product (stories are what sell products)

Take your skill set and use it to start “selling” stuff, there is nobody out there to limit the number of anything you sell... why not make it — millions 😱😉

You'll have more luck using uptilt more since its a lot harder to punish, where as with dair it can be reacted to (but has the upside of leading into kill moves). A psuedo fix for dair is to immediately uptilt (or sometimes downtilt depending on the situation), as dair as shorter landing lag than it appears, allowing you to catch unsuspecting foes. You can do this too on shield due to peoples response to dair being to shield, but they usually unshield too early and get caught by that aforementioned quick uptilt.

* Take in mind they are not designed to cut something thicker than 3mm plastic rods (and even then, if you do that repeatedly you'd worn them off quickly)."

He wants you to believe that he's happy. Why won't you believe that he's happy there's never been to a happier person than him.

Most likely due to his extremely large and stable brain.
"Even Plato and Aristotle considered interest contrary to the nature of things.

*""Lending money at interest gives us the opportunity to exploit the passions or necessities of other men by compelling them to submit to ruinous conditions; men are robbed and left destitute under the pretext of charity.""*

Scripture says ""the borrower is slave to the lender"".

By being in debt, one is by definition not free, rather one is continually paying off debt, most of which is accruing with interest. So usually one is simply paying off interest and not even nearing the principal; this is the shell game of compounding interest.  The more debt one has, the less freedom one has.

Our country has moved so far away from an agrarian system (even within the past 100 years) and private ownership of things to a banking-debt-based system that we have a hard time conceiving how much trouble we are in.   We think we own our things, but we do not 'own' what we have because we are forever paying it off for years and years and years.  It is still owned by the lenders.

When you do not own what you have, you are forced to comply with what the lenders tell you to comply with.  ""Lending money at interest gives us the opportunity to exploit the passions or necessities of other men by compelling them to submit to ruinous conditions; men are robbed and left destitute under the pretext of charity.""

This contributes to other grievous situations whereby people resort to immoral things to pay off their debts, or attempt to."

"My belly deflated instantly. Like about two hours after birth me and my SO where poking in the big whole in my belly. It was super deflated even. I think about a week after it was normal again. It seemed my organs needed some time to get back to their proper place. There was a bit more skin and it all felt a bit saggy, but I fitted into my clothes the next day (even better then before, since my belly was now a hole).

My boobs, I didn't even recognize them. I think about 4 days after giving birth they where so swollen from the milk that every move I made ment leaking milk. I had to pee in a bucket upstairs and had my SO hand me the baby to not turn our house into a milk pool. I only pumped for 3 months, so I've not produced milk for at east 11 months and they are still a lot bigger then before (and they where big before). Also saggy.

Honestly, 10 days pp I had no energy or interest going to a wedding. My son wasn't even allowed to go outside yet and with the difficulty breastfeeding I had to both try to breastfeed and pump. Leaving me about 10 to 20 minutes of ""free"" time inbetween every sleep-diaper-eat-pump-cuddle-sleep-clean pump cycle. I think I would have been fine physically. But emotionally I wasn't capable and since I was breastfeeding, I wasn't able to be apart from the baby long enough to get myself into a dress, have a wedding and out of the dress again. I really hope you won't run into the troubles I did and will be able to go to this wedding."

"I guess, what kind of c&amp;c are you looking for?  This is a very poorly painted model. To your credit you seem to have adequate brush control and there's some flair with the blood spatter, but if I had to rate it I'd say it's sub-tabletop quality.  

Please understand, I'm not saying this to be cruel. Everybody starts somewhere and this looks similar to most people's first attempt.  But I guess I'm not certain what kind of feedback you're looking for.  To summarize what's wrong with it:

1) The paint looks very thick and chunky.  You need to use a palette and thin with water or medium.

2) There's no depth to any of the colors.  Painting something say... green is more involved than just covering it with green paint.  You need to simulate a sense of light and shadow that isn't naturally present on an object that size.  This is most commonly done through techniques such as shading, edge highlighting, or drybrushing.  There are more advanced techniques, but those are the three you should learn first.  

I'd suggest finding a painting tutorial you like on YouTube and following every step exactly.  Doing someone else's color by number can be boring, but having someone walk you through the basic techniques will advance you so much quicker than trying to figure it out via trial and error.  If You know what you want to paint and want a recommendation, let me know."

Look in the center but focus on both sides at the same time. It's trippy.
"Let me begin by saying this dude shouldn't, in my opinion, be appointed to the SCOTUS -- and I'm not american.  Now, in fairness, prescriptively judging the man retro-actively without considering the context of when what happened, happened, is kind of not really giving him any options.  When he was a teenager, it was neither commonplace, expected, nor gainful in any sense to do what you're suggesting (unless, of course, you're a person of character who *also* happens to value public opinion).  So no, him lying right now isn't illogical; regardless of moral consideration, it's his only real play that maintains control of the situation by not leaving it up to the public court of opinion.

And again, in fairness, if he did what you're suggesting back when it happened, he likely wouldn't have gone down the path he did go down, simply because our society doesn't *actually* forgive guilty parties.  It either forgets, or accepts them as is for the lesser evil that they are -- but it very rarely actually forgives.

Ultimately, I don't think fairness in consideration is relevant though because he did what he did, and that should make this a foregone conclusion.  You can't become a SCOTUS when you're legally and/or morally of ambiguous status.  Sucks for him, but it is also exactly and entirely his fault, regardless of ""how unfair people might be"" in judging him.

"Hi, I wrote a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9bklwp/z/e53v498) about castle functions and more specifically how, despite popular misconceptions, they really aren't designed to function as sites of popular refuge.

With that in mind, it's somewhat of a wild goose chase to try and correlate castles with population figures. Rather, correlate the role of the castle with the terrain and the political context. Castles proliferate rapidly in England in the wake of the Norman Conquest precisely because they stand apart from the general population: they provide an effective means for a relatively small and unstable Norman elite to project power across a largely hostile population. A further wave of castle proliferation occurs during The Anarchy of the twelfth century as the political instability and lapses in royal authority encourage nobles to build castles both for protection and to increase their own power. Indeed much of the early part of Henry II's reign sees the forced dismantling of 'unauthorised' castles which would have allowed nobles to challenge royal authority.

In more lowland and central areas of England, castles would be relatively spread out, and many villages and even towns might not have a nearby castle at all. Castles were clustered much more heavily in The Marches, the border areas with Wales and Scotland. Here, more trusted nobles were granted much more contiguous stretches of land to ensure both a more effective defence and more opportunity for expansion. In this context, castles would be built far more densely than might otherwise be suggested by the local population densities in order to properly extend control over strategically important areas and to encourage colonisation of these regions."

Meanwhile FEH has characters with art like Sophia's and Olivia's with questionable anatomy or minimal effort, and absolutely zero background art.

"the answer to this question is yes but for a different reason than most people suggest: This investigation - ordered by trump into his nominee - is really just an extended background investigation by the white house into their nominee. In other words, it's as if Trump woke up one morning and said I think I'd like some more research into a specific area of our nominee's background.

The Senate can ask the FBI to look into federal crimes, for example, but it has no authority to control what the white house does in its own background investigation of its own nominee.

"hi i’ll address this as best i can since this is raised semi frequently

i am really lucky to be born and raised in melbourne where wearing this is not the norm by any means but i’d never get beaten up, arrested or given money because someone’s mistaken me for a homeless person (actually where the fuck yall living where homeless people look like this? i’m moving there)

in general i tend to find large urbanised areas/cities, especially fairly multicultural ones, are full of people wearing “adventurous” / not necessarily “ordinary” clothing and multicultural hubs more so - but e.g japan is as ethnically homogenous as it gets and a fit like this would be very very common in e.g shibuya or inner tokyo

i know it might literally be unsafe for some commenters (you said you’re from israel which is worlds away culturally and geographically) to wear something like this and i understand that but the regurgitated criticism of “haha u wear this out??” isn’t very helpful. the answer is yes and whether that’s because of an entirely different social environment or because i’m tripping on acid whenever i pick my outfits it doesn’t matter, i’d rather people comment on why they think the proportions are off or colour blocking could be better than debate about how publicly wearable this is

lastly as a disclaimer - when i post to this sub, i don’t bother posting fits i wear on a daily basis that everyone’s seen some variant of before and while i have nothing against “lowkey” or more norm-core stuff, if i’m going to contribute to this subreddit i feel like i’d prefer to put up something out of the ordinary. i wear jeans and chucks all the time but don’t particularly see the point in posting that here"

"&gt; How do you think there got to be a Roman Empire anyway?

Romans expanded because that is what romans do, they only became christian after they had already conquered most of the territory. Some people think the reason the roman empire fell is because christianity made them weak (turning the other cheek, love thy enemies, etc)

&gt;Christians learned it from watching Muslims

I mean they kind of did

The Christian Roman still fought wars, but they were much less expansive than before. Most wars were against the Sassanian Persians and were likely much more of run of the mill great power feuds than anything motivated by trying to expand a religion. Historically the first war which was at least in part motivated to help the spread of Christianity was Charlemagne's wars against the pagan Saxons. The Saxons had been partially under his rule, but had rebelled a lot so it was thought that christianizing them would make them more loyal subjects. Charlemange was the grandson of Charles Martel, who was one of the first Christian ruler to repel the Islamic onslaught against Christian Europe at the Battle of Tours in 732

&gt;Your xenophobia is not special. Everyone thinks theirs is the reality-based hatred. Fuck off on out of the West until you learn to live with other kinds of humans instead of blaming 1 in 5 humans for the actions of their respective theocratic fucknuts.

I'm an atheist. I don't really object to living with muslims, but pretending like every single religion is exactly the same is dumb. There is no point in continuously criticizing Christianity (its dead already, you can stop beating it) when there is clearly one religion much more than others which is in need of critique. Our ability to co-exist with muslims relies on our ability to recognize that how we deal with it must be adapted to the nature of the religion."

"**Transport triggered architecture**

In computer architecture, a transport triggered architecture (TTA) is a kind of processor design in which programs directly control the internal transport buses of a processor. Computation happens as a side effect of data transports: writing data into a triggering port of a functional unit triggers the functional unit to start a computation. This is similar to what happens in a systolic array. Due to its modular structure, TTA is an ideal processor template for application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIP) with customized datapath but without the inflexibility and design cost of fixed function hardware accelerators.

"A loop, where the number of iterations is dependent on the MAX_CAPACITY of your truck, seems like it would fill the truck until full while ignoring additional user inputs.

{  
//Fill truck with user inputs here...

numInputs++;

}

Or:

for(numInputs = 1; numInputs &lt;= MAX_CAPACITY; numInputs++)

You can fill the remainder of the truck(array?) with placeholder values if the user enters less than the max capacity of the truck. This is of course assuming the truck is a static size.

"Belief in anything is a weak ternary; either you believe, you disbelieve, or you take no position. The ternary is weak because even those categories have degrees. Technically only a ""strong atheist"" takes the second position, but most self proclaimed atheists, weak or strong, would say they're more inclined to believe that god doesn't exist. The third position is the most logically defensible, and as a result many atheists claim it. Calling yourself an ""apatheist"" is a way to distinguish yourselves from them; you don't take a position, you don't have an inclination, your lack of position isn't based on rigorous philosophy, and quite frankly you don't give a fuck. It's a sensible distinction to make!"

"Regardless of what gameplay style you pick, I'd recommend an engine that makes it as easy as possible for you to add new characters. That way, once you have an initial roster set up, the work to expand upon it is minimal.

As for the gameplay style... honestly, while I liked the complexity of Heritage to the Future, something like FighterZ would be cool to see with JoJo characters. Polish aside, the simple-ish controls and the number of special/super moves per character should make the fighters easier to design. And the assists will let certain characters make more direct references to their appearances in the series (Yasuho, Josuke, etc)."

"(text from article)

I’m about as sick of writing about African gangs in Melbourne as Whaleoil readers probably are of reading about them, but surely nowhere near as frustrated as Melbourne crime beat reporters who must have the phrase of African appearance set as autocorrect phrases by now.

But this is where I grew up. I still have family and friends there and despite the steady denials of lying authorities and cosy elites in Melbourne’s well-heeled suburbs, it just keeps happening.

I can only imagine what the people of suburbs like Tarneit are feeling when rubbish like this happens on a daily basis. 

&gt; A Melbourne woman has been bashed in her home by machete-wielding youths of African appearance, and the city’s top cop said the force has an issue tackling repeat offenders.
&gt; 
&gt; The 34-year-old woman, of Tarneit in Melbourne’s west, drove into her garage last Friday and was followed into her home by four youths. They ransacked her house and stole her car.
&gt; 
&gt; She was punched in the face when they demanded car keys. One of the youths was wielding a machete, police said.
&gt; 
&gt; The attack is the latest violent incident linked to young African-Australians in Melbourne, and is near a park that became a hotbed for youth crime earlier this year. 

The continual soft-pedalling by police certainly can’t be any comfort. 

&gt; Victoria Police chief commissioner Graham Ashton yesterday said investigators from Operation Wayward, set up to track youth offenders in the city’s west, were struggling to tackle repeat offenders.
&gt; 
&gt; “We’re absolutely seeing the same offenders repeat offending, so we’ll absolutely nail them,” he said. “We are continuing to arrest the same people again and again so when they’re out, there is this kind of core group. The community is working with them and we do things to get them off offending but they’re pretty resilient — they like to reoffend.”
&gt; 
&gt; Tarneit and other suburbs in Melbourne’s west have been targeted by Operation Wayward, set up in May to target 64 young offenders with a police officer assigned to each youth. Police also have increased night patrols in the area. 



Hmm. We keep being told this type of crime doesn’t even exist (after all, rich celebrities, politicians and judges don’t feel at all worried about dining out at their hoity-toity restaurants), but that’s an awful lot of police resources being allocated to something that supposedly isn’t there. 

&gt; “These offenders (in Tarneit on Friday) are African-Australian offenders … these operations have been focusing on a range of different but definitely African-Australian kids,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “We’ve been managing these issues in Tarneit and surrounding areas … between the two operations, more than 700 arrests in the past 14 months.
&gt; 
&gt; The operation had been successful in reducing offending in the area. 

Try telling that to the besieged residents. 

&gt; Luke Mitchell ran the area’s Ecoville Residents Association but left Tarneit because of safety concerns. He said the issue of crime still had not been tackled properly although the park had been “reclaimed”.
&gt; 
&gt; “The problem didn’t go away for the neighbouring areas … we haven’t seen any problems in Ecoville … We’ve cleared the trees out … we’ve boarded up the community kitchen …
&gt; 
&gt; “The issue hasn’t gone away; it’s just moved away,” he said.
&gt; 

Locals have had to adopt a scorched-earth policy to try and deal with these criminals. This is insane.

Of course, the great and good of the media-political elite, not to mention Melbourne’s African community itself, whine about “racism”, but: 

&gt; Himashu Soni, who lives opposite Ecoville with his wife and new baby, said the park was “disgusting…You can see the damage — no seats on the benches — but it’s not somewhere I want my child to play.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Soni’s neighbour Tanvi Gumber, who lives in the street with her five-month-old, also said it was not safe for children. 
&gt; 

The longer police, politicians and the media live in denial of this, the uglier things will get. Vigilante groups are already forming but naturally, the left will clutch their pearls and gibber about “racism!”, as soon as the first thug gets his comeuppance.

The left love to jabber about imaginary Scandinavian utopias. Well, they’re well on the way to turning Melbourne into the Sweden of the antipodes. Just not in the way that they imagine."

"Pre-patch was 8.0, which was 1 patch ago, not two. But that aside...

&gt;Then you should know that other triple-A game devs actually listen to feedback. You don't need to study game development to witness what happened to the beta feedback before the release of the expansion. You don't need to study at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment to criticize Blizzard for ignoring feedback when its relevant. Their game director is a lawyer for fuck's sake.

And so does Blizzard. Them not responding to feedback or implementing it when you, a customer, think they should doesn't mean they're not listening. And no, you don't need to be a student at a prestigious college to criticise (never said you had to be, so random point is random?), but you did tell me that I should 'research game development' before I comment further, something I have done, and needed to correct you on. As for Ion? His past as a lawyer is irrelevent. He's been working on WoW for over 10 years. It's not like he's some novice with no background in game design. Most jobs consider you qualified if you have 3-5 years of experience.

&gt;I don't expect instant changes. I expect a lot more from Devs that work for a company like Blizzard. The standard here is higher than, for example, Devs that work for Digital Extremes on Warframe. I am sure you know why I expect more from Blizzard especially since you graduated at the top of your glass from Academy of Interactive Entertainment.

And I expect more too, and I'll be honest, they've dropped the ball more than once. Something Lore pointed out in his posts in that linked thread. Discussions should have been had earlier and some of these changes should have been made earlier. I'm not going to sit here and pretend that the game is perfect and that the complainers are blowing smoke out of their ass, but at the same time, because I understand how game development works, I know that it's not quite as simple as pressing a button to make changes. Additionally, since we're all human, we all make mistakes. Blizzard's developers are no exception to that."

"People have mentioned some touristy stuff to do but here's some authentic Hamilton experiences (from a resident):

* Walks: Taitua Arboretum is really nice. The River walkways are also pretty good but there's lots of other good ones like Wairere Falls, Hakarimata Stairs, Lake Ngaroto that are a bit further away. You can also hire a bike to ride the river trails.

* Gourmet in the Gardens - food trucks with live music Sunday afternoons. 4pm at the Hamilton gardens. 

* Also, the Hamilton gardens themselves are pretty good too

* Have a couple of beers at Good George before wandering down to FMG stadium to watch the championship leading Waikato rugby team in the Mitre 10 Cup. Alternatively, cricket season is coming soon so beers, then wander down to Seddon Park to watch national T20 champions The Northern Knights. 

* Watch the Bridge to Bridge water ski classic in November from the park by Grantham St, or one of the bridges along the river. 

* The Waikato Museum. I know.... it's a museum but it's a pretty good museum IMO. Also Hamilton zoo is pretty good too. 

* The HSBC World Rugby 7s series is on in January and also Fatboy Slim is playing at Claudlands arena on the same weekend. 

* If you're looking for a decent watering hole - Wonderhorse, or a decent restaurant - Chim Choo Ree or Gothenburg.

* Takeaways - the regional treasure that is Wong's Kitchen. Get the fried chicken.  

* Ice Cream - Duck Island. 

* Huntly Speedway. Ok, it's a 40 minute drive but it's worth it, if you're into that kind of thing. "

"&gt; that doesn’t mean she doesn’t know her husband isn’t full of shit

She knows that the people accusing her husband are now ruthless monsters who don't care about the well being of others. Do you really think she's going to believe some former party-animal over the man she's lived with for over a decade?

&gt;his drinking habits

Last I checked, Kavanaugh was upfront about his 'habits' to the point where the right's even memeing about his ""still like beer"" line. Hell, there's even [a shirt](https://www.donaldjtrump.shop/products/still-like-beer-judge-kavanaugh-premium-t-shirt) for it. You have nothing, so you're desperately trying to paint him as an acoholic for no good reason other than he sometimes drinks beer, which, a married wife would know about.

&gt;Even if she doesn’t believe Dr. Ford she probably knows her husband was lying about those things.

He is invariably the choice MLB and ESPN make when they show a clip. He has just enough homer in him to make it exciting but he's got deep respect for the game at large."

"No spread ammo doesn't stun but if you unlocked impact mantle you can use it to have it stun if you shoot the head. Every other attack by any weapon also gets stun with impact mantle but yea.

In solo impact mantle spread shot combo is pretty decent against a lot of monsters. in multiplayer they get resistance to stun only and not other statuses so it doesn't work too well. It will still amplify sticky ammo stun a lot though.

I think you have the best gun for spread in base game. I thought it was anja but the reload and recoil are insane on it so all the upgrades go to fixing that."

Team fixes 3 generators, two survivors die and the other two look for the closed hatch so they can AFK near it until one of them dies and the other one gets a free escape.

It's just the seizure threshold. I mean like 300mg and higher carries a fair amount of increased seizure risk is all.

"I’ve posted this before, but I think it fits here:

Me and my sister were both on this student council thing in high school. The council as a whole did this fundraiser every year for charity, and each member was expected to raise $100. We were told explicitly that we shouldn't go door to door; the charity already had people doing that. Plus ya know it was a student council, gotta get creative and all that.

So, naturally, I decide to just go door to door, because I was lazy. My sister opted not to join me, because we ""weren't supposed to"". So I go out on my own, and very quickly I made over $200!

Weeks go by, and the event gets closer and closer, and my sister doesn't even so much as brainstorm possible things she could do to raise the money. A few days before the event, she asks me for half of my money! Of course I said no, either do it yourself in the limited amount of time you have left, or pay for it yourself.

Then my mom _takes my sister's side_ and tells me I should just give her the 100 dollars so she doesn't have to pay!

You'd think a mother would turn that into a teaching moment - you don't do the work, then you face the consequences. My sister did zero work, and I'm the one that gets punished!! I know it wasn't exactly my money, but still, she had no right to feel entitled to it.

(I'm totally of the opinion that my sister knew exactly what she was doing as soon as I came home with 200 dollars but I digress).

So the next year I got smart, and still only went door to door but I only went out to get 100 dollars. The last person to give me money gave me like 20 bucks so I ended up with like 115.

My sister, again, did nothing to raise any money. Then had the audacity to ask me for the 15 dollars I had extra!! I told her to shove it this time and she had to pay the full 100 dollars.

She would have been on the force at that time, and as someone who knows a few officers in that area, that was a scary time.

""All lives matter"" or ""blue lives matter"" isn't necessarily a racist sentiment when one of your family members was a target during something like that.

"I don't really have a recipe formost of what I cook, I have ingredients and modify as I go. I will give explain it the best I can. I started by seasoning a pound off turkey burger with chili, garlic, and onion powder and made it into a big patty. I smoked it with hickory at about 250 until it reached 160. Then I crumbled the turkey in cast iron pot, and added two cans of drained kidney beans, one large can of crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, about 1T of minced garlic, two green onions chopped, and chili powder to taste. The grill method was indirect heat at 300 (added a couple of hickory chunks to charcoal) while the bread cooked.

"I would like to point out tough just how MUCH energy we are talking here. Say we take the example of Ceres, with a radius of r=475km and a mass of m=9.4e20kg and spin it so it has an artificial gravity of a=3m/s^2 (~0.3g) at its surface, pointing outward. 
The angular velocity required for this is given by omega = sqrt(a/r) = 0.0025 rad/s, or 1.44 rotations per hour.
With this we can get the energy E=0.5*I*omega^2, with being the momentum of inertia of the respective object (let's assume a sold sphere with I=0.4*m*r^2). Plug all this in results in a energy of E=5.6*10^23 Joule, which is equivalent to 6200 Tons of mass directly converted to energy, or (according to Wolfram Aplha) energy released by the [Chicxulub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater) meteor impact.

Now whether or not this is theoretically achievable for humanity aside, I feel like a civilization capable of providing such a large amounts of energy for what amounts to a luxury (after all you don't NEED gravity to live on Ceres) would be a lot more advanced than humanity portraied in the Expanse. 

But math aside, if I remember correctly the authors were aware of this fact, but decided including spun-up asteroids would improve the story, which trumps realism in my book."

"While high my memory was active, but it felt very far removed. Like some part of my brain knew that if I walked off the balcony that I'd get to the ground faster. But my legs walked down the stairs. A part of me remembered to avoid death. My brain connected dehydration with a weed high. Thus, I drank a ton of water. But I didn't remember having acquired this knowledge. My brain knew answers to questions (my name, my birth date) when I had no recollection of having acquired this information. My mind said ""I don't know"" but the right words always came out my mouth.

And it was like time was repeating itself and my brain was working very hard to figure out why I was feeling abnormal. Somehow my brain knew to drink water, check my heart rate, put on pants, and to check myself into the ER. My resting heart rate was at 114 and somehow my brain knew that was ""not right"" but I have no memory of where this knowledge came from or why it was important. I felt as if I had no memory of past events but at the same time my brain knew and took control ensuring every action was in my best interest. I knew to avoid certain people but at the same time I couldn't tell you why except for ""it's not right."" I did things like lock the front door before leaving for the ER and calling for a designated driver, but the entire time my mind was questioning why I did that or how I knew to do that."

I have 5 defenders at least all the time behind the ball and 2 guys up front for possible counters. 

Lucas and Carrasco are nightmare to deal with

Can recommend 3-4-3 with side midfielders set to come back on D and CMs set to stay back, balanced attack, worked in 10 squad battle games for me, 9 of those were wins, 4 of them on ultimate, wish I tried it earlier so I could reach even higher rank"

"&gt;You probably do have the understanding necessary to see that scientology and antivaxxers are kooks, despite your low opinion of your reasoning abilities ;) What you clearly don't have, and what this discussion has hammered in over and over, is any clue what the entire debate about Mann's reconstruction has been about. I'm suggesting that you take a step back and reflect on why you've taken up this hardline position on an issue you've given such little thought to or put in such little effort to understand.

At some stage refusing to pore over the schematics of every free-energy device that crosses your desk becomes a time-saving measure. There is nothing hardline position about it. It is is the only sane position on offer.

Again: There is no possible context in which that chart is acceptable. None. I don't know, and I don't particularly care, what he *thought* he was doing. Placing two series like that next to each to illustrate anything on a single chart for whatever  reason is meaningless.

The only way it could be vaguely acceptable is if the relationship between measurements was airtight. And even then it's a stretch. But it isn't. So that's the end of the story.

&gt;There is absolutely nothing wrong with the way the chart was produced. The very person you are citing as a source that chart was produced wrongly himself says there is nothing wrong with the way the chart was produced.

If someone explains to you that device that you have failed to understand working of is a free energy device, but insists that free-energy devices are okay just this once it is perfectly acceptable to accept his analysis of the workings and reject the notion of it working.

&gt;Nope! I made a claim that I am happy to provide supporting evidence for if you wish to challenge it. You made a claim and are now steadfastly refusing to substantiate it.

So, let's run this again. You claim that CO2 control climate by some mechanism, but before you substantiate the claim I must substantiate the claim that CO2 does not control the climate? 

That's not how this works.

The claim that inflections in ΔCO2 follows inflections in ΔTemp is observational. It does not require further substantiation and it falsifies the AGW hypothesis outright.

&gt;You made a scientific claim that I will consider to be false until you substantiate it. Thanks for settling that up so concisely.

So you now think that inflections in ΔCO2 precedes inflection in ΔTemp?

The problem is that your theory violates logic. I cannot substantiate logic to you (or at least that is a different discussion)."

So I figured, how can I be certain a chair will be built well enough to hold my weight and not break down over just a year or two? There were two answers to my question: spend well over a grand on a well-designed and well-constructed brand-name chair... Or buy a chair meant for very heavy people. I wasn't light, but at 200lbs, I was half the weight that the 'big and tall' chairs were made for, and they were made with strong, hearty construction to be able to put up with being sat on by 400lb people all day every day.

My bet paid off - my big butt chair has held up marvelously over the years! If anyone wants it, I could probably dig the brand and model out of my old email."

All I'm saying is that XLM would certainly have them once it becomes big enough. And if it does *and* survives I would be happy to concede that it is as secure as Bitcoin.

"99 damage at ~3 meters or closer to a 2 armor attacker, with steep drop off outside that range (down to 20 at ~22m), which pretty much means 1 headshot or 2 bodyshots will down an opponent at close range.

It's pretty strong at point blank for a semi-auto weapon, but is, like every other pistol, crap outside ~10m or so, has like 0 terrain penetration, and cannot spray (duh).

Also, the Luison guarantees DBNO and cannot kill unless the target is already down.

"**Chicxulub crater**

The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 10 to 15 kilometres (6.2 to 9.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs.

"And what part of ""women who only care about looks aren't the type of woman you should be worried about"" did you miss? You've had bad experiences, okay cool. Go out into the street. Look around. You see people walking about. About half or more will have had bad dating experiences. That doesn't stop them from continuing to date. Many of them will be married with kids now. Not all of them will be attractive. You might find some of them ugly by your own standards. But there they are, happily involved with other people.  

You're so focused on what you deem to be your hideous looks that you can't see the forest for the trees. If you have BDD then your looks are an obsession. I get it. I'm on this subreddit for a reason too. I have that same obsession, just in a different way than you do. But that's just it. Your own perception is flawed. That's what BDD does. 

I guarantee you, you go to any other group of people, askmen, askreddit, twoxchromosomes, dating or whatever it is, they will tell you exactly what I have told you.  

This isn't a looks problem, this is a perception problem. You perceive looks to be the be all and end all. That's obvious from your post and comment. Women are hypergamous? Ingrained in their genetics? Besides that being incredibly close minded, how do you explain average and ugly people (not just men) dating and having kids and families? I'm a balding very average to below average looking pale dude. I have terrible genetics, not limited to a bad back, bad eyesight (which I fixed with laser surgery), Irish skin and so on (it's a massive list). For me to be here, my Dad needed to have found a partner. I know I'm not the best looking person around. But my value isn't based off how I look, but rather my quality as a person. 

I recently turned 28. It took me until my early 20s to realise that people don't give a shit about the things that I cared about such as my hairline, that was a big one for me. Once I accepted me for who I was, I quickly found myself in relationships and making friends quicker than I normally would. People aren't dating me for how I look, and if they were then I wouldn't be dating them. I know my strengths and I know everything that I have to offer as a partner. The quality of my partner as a person is far more important to me than how they look. I wouldn't date a supermodel if she was an asshole or treated others with contempt. But if she was kind, warm, funny and considerate? Then her looks would just be a great bonus on top of what is already a great partner. 

But that's me. You need to find your own worth. I can't help you with that. I'm not dismissing your insecurities. I'm dismissing your attitude towards looks in general. Until you get over the idea of looks being the only thing that matter, you'll never accept yourself. If you can't accept yourself, then how can you expect anybody else to accept you? "

"Looking like something doesn't make you that thing. Also what the fuck is that example with your dog? Little bit different catching your dog eating litter than it is finding out if someone is guilty of sexual assault. One is possibly criminal, but fuck legal definitions in cases like this, I guess. (also fuck regular definitions too because guilty in that case still means they deserve blame for a given wrongdoing)

Usually you'd investigate sexual assault and stuff to find the truth but nah, let's just judge every person by if they 'look guilty like when a dog does something wrong.'

"I come from a very poor family but ended up befriending a lot of people in upper class families for some reason. When it came time to apply to colleges I ended up going to a local community college that was close to home in case of emergencies. A friend of mine got into a local university and lived in the same town. 
We were talking one night about how college was going and the topic switched to how we were paying for everything. I applied for every kind of financial aid possible, applied to every scholarship I could find, and ended up only qualifying for low interest loans. Since this was my only option I took it. My friend who's family could have easily paid for his entire college tuition ended up getting all kinds of financial aid and scholarships. 
I am going to be finishing a bachelor's in chemistry soon but still will have 60,000+ in loans while he ended up paying nothing. The thing that really pissed me off was him telling me I should have applied for financial aid or applied for some scholarships. "

We’ve moved out now without buying the house because I hated being yet another burden on them given everything that was and is going on. My (adoptive) dad also lost his dad to cancer and his brother died suddenly and unexpectedly in 2016 after a complication with a heart condition.

"GUESS WHAT'S OUT TODAY! Third Flatiron's Fall 2018 anthology, featuring my short story ""Winter War""! It's packed with 24 new stories that run the genres from deep sci-fi to creeping horror to whimsical urban fantasy (that's me!), plus reprints, poems, jokes, and everything that makes a collection worth it.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GYDBKS8

It's free for Kindle Unlimited subscribers, but only $10.49 in paperback, which works out to less than 50 cents a story--and believe me, these are excellent uses of your pocket change.

Here's the synopsis for my entry: ""At Hyde Park's Christmas Fair, three tribes of *sidhe* battle for the heart of a young girl. Their weapons of choice? Scents, memories, and the world's greatest fudge, in Samuel Chapman's whimsical ""Winter War""."""

I have to make 37.5m gp/h in order for training fishing to be break even with TH. To some that's absurdly out of their reach, but to an also large group of people that's nothing.

If you go by other rates from people then it'd only cost about half that for 200m fishing, 4.5b. Still sounds like a lot but that makes it from 37.5m gp/h to only 18.75m gp/h which is even in more peoples reach. "

"Those stats are probably from people recently born in Serbia when it was not Yugoslavian. Statistics Sweden didn't track the separate countries before they existed de jure. In total there are more people from Yugoslavia (65 877) than Turkey (48 299) in Sweden, and probably a lot more if we also count second generation immigrants with Yugoslavian parents.

Shobre Swedish has several words which has (at least supposedly) Yugoslavian origin: bolane - friend; ajde - hey/hurry; majmun - monkey; kurva - whore; parra - money. Are they correct?

I think it's well established that ""bre"" is some form of ex-Yugoslavian, but it could either be just an interjection as you say or some non-Serbian variation where it has a different meaning. I find it odd that most Swedish sources say it's Serbo-Croatian and that it means ""bro"". It's that I don't believe you, but it's part of a very common phrase and people should know better.

"&gt; I thought the FDIC is the insured limit. If the bank goes tits up, you are only insured up to 250k.

This is correct. If you have $300k in a checking account at Wells Fargo, you can access it all immediately, but if Wells Fargo goes bust, then you're only getting $250k from the deposit insurance. If you take $50k of that and put it in an account at Bank of America, and then *both* Wells Fargo and Bank of America go bust, you'll get your full $300k back ($250k for WF and $50k for BoA).

Some investment brokerages offer checking accounts that distribute the funds across different banks to ensure that large balances are fully insured. So you could have $2M in a checking account like that and it would all be covered by FDIC because it would be split across 8+ different banks."

"The Sovereign Class is one of my all-time favorite designs and in my eyes a true successor to the Excelsior Class.

The problem i see though is that it is large and thus expensive to build and operate. And with the new designs Starfleet seems to move a bit away from the generalist designs (not to mention that they still have a lot of those around in the Excelsiors, Nebulas and Galaxies) and more to specialized designs like the Defiant, Intrepid, Nova, Sabre, Norway and Prometheus-Class.

The Sovereign on the other side is impressive, large and good for show of force or diplomacy missions where a certain attitude might prove useful, but the roles it could take can also and most likely better be done with smaller vessels, although you might need more than one to fill the gap.

I realy did regret that they didnt use the design more official shows because i did grow quite fond of it. But the reason why we do not see more of them could also simply be that the class was never intended to be large and/or loses during the Dominion War took their part to prevent their adoption as a general class.

Keep in mind that Flagship-Classes like the Galaxy and Consitution saw relativ small initial production. From the Flagship-Classes i think only the Excelsior saw extensive use, and when the Excelsior-Class was choosen for the Enterprise-B the class was no longer new and in its 2nd itteration with the modifications done to the original design.

It might be very well be that Starfleet currently does not see the need to build more of the Sovereign Class, but that might very well change at some point when the need arises. Also, the success of the Enterprise-E might be contributing to the decision to maybe restart production with the adjustments made during her shakedown cruise and career.

I think that the Sovereign Class, being a large, very complex design might just have had the problems described in Bridge Commander and in the end just needed time to correct them until full production would start.

Keep in mind that at the time Voyager got constructed, Starfleet had seemingly restarted building Galaxy Class ships (Utopia Planitia Scene in Voyager). This could be because Starfleet is rather slow to adopt new designs even when finished and plan the production ahead for a relativ long time until there is a need and to give time to correct flaws and problems with the first batch of ships.

Also, the Dominion War might have contributed to delay the adoption of the Sovereign Class because such large vessels take additional time to build and thus building smaller classes to fill the gaps under wartime construction conditions might be more usefull.

Not to mention that we actually do not officialy know what happens after Nemesis. We just got Hints and Non-Canon (Star Trek Online / the Books) sources as to how the story goes on and it could be very well that Starfleet is rolling out the Sovereign Class now, when they replaced the gaps of smaller ships from the Dominion War."

When I first discovered that subreddit, I was initially opposed just because birth is so normalized by our culture that we don’t even question it, but the more suffering I saw in the world, the more I realized how irresponsible it was to bring new people into it.

If you continue to be interested, I recommend this great video series that I found on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkQbKJ7z-Oa9T4dC1aNEULuHTXEn9dV2i"

"Regarding the first link, this passage stood out:

&gt;Every academic measure shows that a large percentage of American high school graduates lack the reading, writing and math skills to pass introductory college courses, and despite reliable data warning that these students are unlikely to succeed in college, hundreds of thousands of them are permitted to enroll in college each year, only for them to inevitably to fail out. The practice of admitting students who are not capable of doing college-level work causes a great deal of misery and an enormous waste of time, public resources and the students’ money.

That is the heart of the problem. But I have also read that the intellectual gap/leap from  high school work to college work is high enough that even high school grads with good grades are sometimes unprepared. Sometimes students who coasted by in high school are in fore a rude awakening when they get to college, because the work suddenly gets harder and also the unstructured environment makes it easier to slack off. And also there is a lot of competition to get in a good grad school."

"Iajutsu as written in the core rulebook does not allow for use as a combat skill. It pertains to ""the formal dueling system"" and is used for iajutsu duels as described on p. 87. At the end of the strike phase, the combat shifts from the iajutsu duel to a normal skirmish (using kenjutsu as the combat skill), which would prevent the use of the skill.

All that said, John Wick and Shawn Carman write often about rule zero, and I think it definitely applies here. If your GM allows it, there's nothing that says you can't use iajutsu for that purpose."

"My mom told me something that really stuck with me when I was 16. I was 'hanging out with a guy' and we were 'just friends' because he was a little older and I didn't think they'd approve. She asked me one day if I liked him as a boyfriend. I said yes, thinking I was going to get lectured. She said to have him come over and meet her and dad. When I asked if she was OK with it, she said, ""Well, I don't really like the idea of you dating someone older but if I told you not to, you would just sneak around and do it anyway. I would rather meet him and have you be honest instead of forcing you to sneak around to see someone you like."" She was right, telling me not to date him would not have worked. I was already sneaking around and if she forbade it I could have gotten in a bad situation and not been able to talk to her about it because I was breaking her rules.

How many of us snuck around to do things our parents didn't approve of? How many of us have kept a relationship secret or knew someone else who did because they would get in trouble if the parents knew? I knew a few people who got in abusive relationships or got pregnant and hid it all from their parents as long as they could instead of going to them for help because they were so afraid. 

I'm not saying your daughter would definitely sneak around and do it anyway, especially if she's a good kid in general. But when teenagers think they are in love they do silly and dumb things. Maybe this would be a good approach with your husband. Ask him if he's ever done anything his parents told him not to."

"When my family lived in Saudi in the early 90s, they would have the same advertisements for beauty products as any Western department store...except the store owners would black out the majority of the face/hair with a black marker.

Edit : I can see where OP would find this plausible. I lived there and initially thought it was legit as well. Things do regularly get taken to an extreme there that borders on absurd (which, if I’m not mistaken, is the purpose of this sub)."

"I'd definitely recommend studying abroad! I went to South Korea through Stony Brook during Fall 2017, and I absolutely loved it! The food was incredible, and there's a ton of exchange students too so you probably won't feel left out, not to mention that the native students there are generally kind and speak good English. Moreover, it wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. For example, while the food here generally costs $10, the food in Korea costs $5-6 on average. Also, the dormitory only costed $550 for one whole semester, of which $100 was a pre-deposit that you get back after the semester finishes, so only $450 in total.

You can also travel to many different places with low cost and efficiency. The subway is such a blessing, you can travel almost anywhere in short time. And be prepared to drink, cause the people there love it lol (but they won't force you)

The best part though (at least for me) is that you just need a grade of C or higher in the classes you take, and you pass and it doesn't affect your stony brook gpa. So you don't exactly have to cram through class, as long as you don't fail. 

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I went to Seoul National University and I won't recommend it 100%. It is cheaper than the other universities in Korea because it is a public university and is one of the most prestigious university in Korea, but the classes were hard. Just think that a lv300 course here equals a lv100 course there. But overall it is manageable and was a great experience"

Check it out more at 
https://www.reddit.com/user/bigbootymami19/comments/8jf54a/my_sissy_curriculum/?utm_source=reddit-android

**CUCK DATE**

Have you ever wanted to be humiliated in public? Pay for a bull and a hot girls meal only to be torn down and reminded how incompetent u are? Watch as he fingers her under the table or grab her boobs? Have to pick up the bill knowing hes going to go home and fuck her?? 

My cuck dates are anywhere from 2 hours to 6 hours long. There are 2 packages 

DATE&amp;PLAY I 
Andrew and I are hungry. We go out to a nice restaurant have a couple drinks. Just a nice couple on a date right? Ha! Except my cucky at home (you) will be footing the bill. Throughout the date u recieve live video clips of me humiliating u in public. 
After the date we go back to his place where some...fun ensues.. and u also recieve live clips of that. (Note: no humiliation while I'm getting fucked. I like enjoying dick. It's about pleasing me). Afterwards I text u to tell u all about how it felt etc. 

DATE&amp;PLAY II
The above with the addition of... a hotel room that you ""pay for"". 
Instead of it being a 2-3 hour ordeal, the fun lasts into the night. I text u during the night after we head back to the hotel. Telling u what's going on... there may be a round 2. I tease u throughout the night till my closing time. 
Additionally, you can buy me lingerie or an outfit to get fucked in or pay to get my nails done a certain way so u can see what they look like wrapped around a real mans cock

"I have no real experience with r/pussypassdenied, but the other two are most certainly commonly misogynistic in their tone and message.

Let’s start with r/braincels, as they’re the one’s I’ve dealt with the most.

A fundamental part of the narrative on that post is the idea that women are unavoidably attracted to a hyper masculine man they characterise as ‘chad’, and all women will be eager to have sex with chad as much as he wants until they are ‘too loose’ (they have an erroneous idea that a lot of sex, especially with many different people, makes the vagina looser) and run down, at which point they ‘settle’ for a rich man who is generally not hyper masculine and leech his money while denying him sex. They also believe they are prevented from being a chad by aspects of their looks, frequently extremely minor things, for instance there are those who call themselves ‘wristcels’, and believe hey are discounted because their wrists aren’t thick enough. These beliefs tend to manifest in anger at women, loneliness and frequently a desire not to ‘sink’ to having sex with these ‘stacies’ (as the sexually prolific women are called).

This entire thing is wrapped in misogynistic overtones - the disgust with the idea that a woman would have multiple sexual partners, while seeing a man having multiple sexual partners as the ideal for any man - the ‘chad’ being something they are jealous they cannot be. The idea that all women are only attracted to one very specific thing, ignoring that tastes exist, as well as the idea that women cannot help themselves when presented with this hyper masculine parody - removing their agency.

r/MGTOW has a lot of the same ideas - that women are sluts unable to control their voracious sexual desires, that women are mpsimply drains on their resources, they treat women as objects in a similar way, only seeing them as useful for sexual purposes,generally not even desiring an emotional connection with a woman - going their own way."

"The advice you have gotten so far is of questionable value. If I were you, I would skip the Citi AA Plat altogether for the time being and get the CIP. Here's why:

1. If you are eligible for the CIP, that means you are below 5/24. Typical advice is to maximize the use of your 5/24 slots for the restricted Chase cards. Take a look at the [credit card recommendation flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/9hf4ex/faq_credit_card_recommendation_flowchart/) for ideas. You can always get a Citi AA Plat later.

2. If you have never had a Citi AA Plat, you don't even need the mailer. There is a [public 60k offer](https://secure.fly.aa.com/citi/footer-plathv) available.

"I would say you should stick to Player Match. That's a good, relatively stress free way to get to know your character and other characters in the game.

Player Match also gives you an environment where you can try to practice getting used to moves that you know are good, but are not using regularly.

I would only go to practice mode if you run into an opponent who is repeating a simple strategy of 1-3 moves that beats you over and over again. Go into practice then, find out the weakness of those moves (Can you punish them on block? Can you duck a high? Block or low parry a low? Sidestep them? Backdash out of them after a hit?) and then go back to player match."

"~95% of complaining about SC5's *multiplayer* ultimately comes down to the cast changes. Namco went a little Street Fighter 3 on the series; some people (me) really respected that, but most fans seemed pretty mad about it. Major criticisms of its gameplay mechanics are exaggerated by those trying to sound more rational than they would just complaining it's missing [that little girl](http://soulcalibur.wikia.com/wiki/Talim) they love so much. It wasn't perfect -- SC2 had serious problems too! -- but mechanically SC5 was an extremely solid 3D fighting game. It made bold but smart changes to the franchise, and if the cast had been nothing but fanservice choices most of those 'gameplay complaints' would have disappeared.

I'm not sure if Namco really fixed that cast issue with SC6. They re-added a bunch of 'classic' characters, but there's still plenty of obvious missing choices and the cast itself seems fairly small. More concrete problems with SC5 like the questionable netcode, general pacing issues, and controversial meter management remain in 6. So I'm guessing it's going to go the exact way you suggest, with a bunch of early hype before it mostly dies off. Cue another decade of whining SC2 fanboys.

(SC5's single player was terrible and anemic, I won't argue otherwise. All complaints about that are totally justified. And for the record I personally liked the meter management, though I went in expecting to hate it so I understand the complaints.)"

That place fills me with absolute fury every time I pass it and I honestly hope they get cited or closed down cause they even used to  beat kids with rulers and shit.

TL;DR

Bullied in school, teacher punishes me based on some rando's lie, mom pops off on em and I left, wish that kid gets super aids and that school burns down with no-one inside."

At most any other store, $300 worth of product given away for free means someone's ass is grass. Why did she say yes??

And if the answer to that is ""yes"" then please PM me the name of the store with a corporate so incompetent so I can go get free clothes next clearance day. 

Not to mention any customer that overheard what went down could be like, ""well you gave THEM the extra discount so why can't I have it??"" That sets a bad precedent for others to become troublemakers, once they see what they could get away with.

"Once again fall is upon us and with the colder weather returning, this beef stew is the perfect way to warm yourself up. The options for this are truly endless, but I like this served over some cauliflower rice for an excellent meal. This also makes a ton, so it will make many lunches (and honestly, gets even better after a day or to). 

Also note – radishes when cooked in this way do NOT taste like radishes, but more like potatoes. They are a really stellar addition to this dish.

**INGREDIENTS**

* 2 tbps avocado oil
* 1 medium onion (diced)
* 1 lb shitake mushrooms
* 15 radishes (halved)
* 3 carrots (chopped)
* 2lb stew beef
* 1 6oz can tomato paste
* 4 cups beef stock
* 2 bay leaves
* Salt and Pepper to taste
* 1/2 tsp xanthan gum

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan (I used a dutch oven), add diced onion, some salt and cook until translucent.
1. Add garlic, and mushrooms cook until fragrant.
1. Add the cubed beef and brown on all sides.
1. Next, mix in the radishes, carrots, tomato paste, beef stock, and bay leaves.
1. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 2-4 hours until the meat is tender.
1. Sprinkle Xantham gum (option, but makes a nice thick sauce) and let cook another 15-20 minutes until thickened.

"""Everyday when I get home from work I sit down at the piano and play"". Try that thought on for yourself (or something similar that works for you). Say it. Think it. Practice it. Visualize it. Just a thought to try on. It's not as essential that that be what actually happens as it is that that's a habitual thought. That will compel the circumstance.

So that's what I do for the most part (and while the microwave is running). As soon as I come in the door I sit down and play til I get some sort of emotional resolution or satisfying musical exploration or clearly enhanced skill or repertoire from the experience of practice. I fantasize about it while I'm at my restaurant job. Also I have an acoustic in my living room and digital in my room which helps. So I can't avoid it. I play chronically. I play when I should I be should be doing other more pressing things... 

BUT more concretely you need to figure out your goals. Why are you playing? What are you aiming to learn when you sit down? Sheets? Harmony? Repertoire? Improv? What subskills in those categories are you focused on? What is your main musical focus right now? You don't need to know the answer to those questions right now but they are useful guides. The reason to play will motivate you to play and structure practice segments and set goals which can be met so you get that sense of reward. It doesn't even need to be about passion like you said. Though as I was discussing with a friend last night I have a sense of ""I feel like I'm not me if I don't play piano a bunch throughout the week"". But that's my thing not yours, maybe.

"You have to submit either all SAT scores or all ACT scores (or both), so you would have to submit the 1470 as well. I don’t believe you have to send all subject test scores. Score choice means that if you happen to have done better on one section on one version of the test and better on the other section on another test date, they’ll add together your highest math score and highest verbal score and count that as your total score. If you did better on both sections on one test, you still have to send both scores, but they won’t use score choice for you. 

I wouldn’t be worried about it though - they usually only mostly care about your highest score. They might look at your lower score, but the median for engineering is only a little over 1500, so you should be fine either way. 

Edit: To clarify, when I say you should be fine, I don’t mean that you’re guaranteed to get in, just that your test scores won’t hurt your chances. Obviously they consider other factors like grades, extracurricular activities, essays, etc."

"Awesome, thanks again! 

Definitely seems like convincing them I'm going back to the states is going to be my biggest hurdle. If I set up with my grandparents (my only family, previously my legal guardians) as my permanent address, do you think that would make a difference in that aspect? As much as I'd love to stay in Canada, I'm **not** trying to pull a fast one on anyone. I have every intention of leaving the country when they want me to. My main concern is having the paper trail for that to be convincing, because I do live a pretty unrooted lifestyle. 

It's good to know that being an author is considered skilled, but I don't have hour records or anything. I've got 30+ published books under my pen names and contracts for another 15 or so I've written this year. Sounds like I need to keep making contracts, which is totally doable. 

I filled out the Express Entry thing a little bit ago, so we'll see what that says, but I'm not holding my breath, like you said. *But* having said that, my contract work *does* overlap and *is* continuous, so that gives me a better shot? 

I'm struggling to figure out how to prove how much work I've done. Editing 4 million words a year doesn't really translate to an hourly figure. "

"And this is where you demonstrate your unfailing ability to just ignore the facts that are inconvenient to you x'D.

&gt;not even the very first one- or two-word sentences are ever perceived as having a ""foreign prosody"". That may be due to the very early acquisition of prosody.

^ The above is a meaningless statement, and your argument can't even get off the ground if you can't demonstrate otherwise.

Additionally, while you're simply trying to change the topic to distract from your inability to counter the above point, you're simply wrong about the purpose of the article. Acquisition of prosody is an important component of what it's talking about, but it mentions ""pronunciation"" which you claim is distinct from prosody numerous times:

&gt;**Initially** concentrating very much on prosody, the learner is guided through perception enhancement techniques and extensive chorus repetitions to imitate native-like **pronunciation**, to reproduce it robustly, and to hear himself succeed with this so many times that it is his own, now native-like pronunciation

&gt;That is, we should give the second language learners the chance to choose how they want to speak, **by adding near-native or even native pronunciation to their repertoire** [Sarabasa, 1997]. If we do not try that, it will be equivalent to forcing most of them to become fossilized with a stigmatizing **foreign accent** that may keep many of them from reaching a reasonable social and professional standard in their exile in countries or areas where the native tolerance is low (such as in Sweden).

^ This one is particularly damning. The author states that by not teaching native/near native accent, the speaker will be left with a foreign accent. They are not in any way stating that the ONLY component of having a native accent is native prosody you fucking dumbass.

&gt;.Furthermore, contrary to common beliefs, **among the various aspects of pronunciation the prosody** may even be the least difficult for adult L2 students to learn, given the proper chances as this method does.

&gt;**As a result of the exceptionally good pronunciation** that this method will lead to, the learners can really pursue communicative exercises (a recent fad among teachers) in pairs or small groups, when, in contrast to traditional classes, **they will not have to listen to various types of foreign accent from each other, but the target language with near-native accent**.

Are we done, or do you have any more intellectually dishonest flailing to do?"

I'm calling them beyond salvageable not because they're worthless, in fact I love the vast majority of them, but because it's highly likely IS isn't gonna do anything about them. For many of them the only way to be better in the current meta is to gain more merges, as a lot of them are stuck at +2, +3, or some TTs at +1 (Gerome and Finn always pop to mind when thinking of those poor guys).

You can @ me about this later when it happens cuz imma call it right now: When Validar is added as a GHB, he will be seen as aggressively mediocre. If he is added to the pool afterwards he will be considered decent. If not, he will be one of the lesser units in the game.

So the solution is just put the things in the pool to not only increase the overall attainability of them, but for their overall usability as well."

"Fire spells are a thing and I suppose that an adept mage could also cast them from other parts of the body, then you have firebending. Lightningbending, even easier, there's the shock spells for that.

Waterbending could work as a specific application of the telekinesis spell (not that you can move water ingame but I think it's just a question of engine limitations). Apply it on any body of flowing water and you have regular waterbending, and apply it on a body's own blood and muscles and you have neat bloodbending. Mix this with ice-casting spells and you have one hell of a waterbending mage. Actually, considering the Akaviri influences (by this I mean the importation of martial arts) I wouldn't be surprised if the Nibenese would practice some form of waterbending thingy similar to the AtLA. You'd only have to mix Akaviri !wushu with local knowledge of magic.

Hard to say, but they've got a tough race against Oogie Boogie and his plan to convert the holiday into Bug Day.

In trying to understand how a holiday that can seem so jolly could have such a grim center, Jack continues to research into Christmas until he learns that Krampus isn't the Christmas King, Santa is. Jack is still well-liked, so even without his official power, Jack is still able to organize a plan to bring Christmas to Halloween Town under the table. Things then proceed quite similarly to the official timeline, except that Oogie Boogie's defeat results in a vacancy for Pumpkin King opening again, a vacancy the newly-inspired Jack is all too eager to fill."

He's trying narrow the gap of where this player might be so from his statement and without the knowledge of the GW2 League, you can conclude the mystery player is somewhere between OR 24k and Or 34k."

Same for trying to force men into say, nursing or teaching at primary schools. 

I'm totally against the idea of women feeling left out or pushed away due to male domination, but I'm also firmly against any kind of quota or ""executive action"" to force ""equality"" in this regard. 
If merit means domination of one gender or even race, so be it. So long as everyone had an equal chance to start with.

"When in the course of a non-criminal investigation the FBI or any other investigative agency discovers criminal activity, they don't just go, 'Oh well, not part of the investigation.' The issue with the limiting to four people is that the number of avenues they can use to find hints of the rot are being curtailed. Instead of being allowed to pursue all avenues, like the fact that he has undoubtedly perjured himself, and the fishy business with ""baseball tickets"" they are being limited. 

Those articles, as far as I can tell, are not saying that they ever have or ever will ignore criminal activities outside of the initial scope of an investigation. So if in the course of the limited investigation they're doing, they find something, the narrative changes..

I could be wrong, but I'd like a definitive source that isn't just conjecture to tell me that the FBI will *ignore* criminal business like that. That's absurd."

Relationships are personal between two people. Men certainly get no support from the justice system, at least in my country, and none from their friends from what I've seen, so I don't see what system could be causing it.

If it was systemic, then you might have a point. If I as a man was partly responsible for other men beating their wives. But I can't see how I'm supporting that in any way at all"

"My biggest pet peeve with apartment deliveries are the complexes that decide to live up to their name; complex (and terribly laid out).

For example I have to deliver to F-203. Simple enough. I get there and not only are the apartments arranged in no order whatsoever, the sign that says what the apt letter is either obstructed by the shelters over the parking lots, or, for god knows what reason, a tree was planted *right in front* of the sign, making it impossible to see. Oh and on top of that, the 2 in 203 that indicates it's a 2nd floor apartment turns out it's actually on the third floor and the numbers are also not in a meaningful order. I don't know why they would do that, but they do. 

I don't know who it is getting hired to design the layouts of these places, but that idiot needs to stop getting hired for that. 

Thank you to the customers who take the time to explain where their apartment is and how to get to it, some of the layouts are confusing as all hell. "

"Put [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) on your phone. I am not joking.

Schedule tasks like ""Regular Cycle Laundry (Tuesday),"" ""Hoover the Living Area (Wednesday)"" to pop up on a weekly basis. Have a widget of your to-do list on your home screen at all times.

Establish respectfully, but clearly, that you want to have a schedule for when you do these chores, and that she should not do them. The actual time you do them isn't important, as long as you get them done that day. (Well, don't put clothes in the washing machine right before bed, but otherwise you get the idea.)

Tell your GF that you're really bad at managing things like restocking groceries etc., because your brain just doesn't work that way. But any physical labor that can be put on a weekly or bi-weekly or tri-weekly basis, you are 100% willing to do. Washing dishes, doing laundry, vacuuming, and so forth. Emphasize that you're bad at reminding yourself, and she shouldn't have to remind you, so the app will fulfill that purpose.

What you're ultimately aiming for is, you want your GF to feel that you and her both put in equal amounts of effort, and have equal amounts of free time. If she doesn't have any interests or hobbies, encourage her to develop one. 

Emphasize that there should come a point in the day where everything is either done, or can wait, and that she should relax. You should take her free time very seriously, because if she's trying to do chores during her established free time, that will only reinforce the idea of her doing more. The goal is, everything urgent should be done by a certain time."

&gt; He did not purchase a WoTC product.

It seems like you are essentially saying WotC shouldn't care or do anything about **licensed** retailer negatively impacting their products and customers because they are technically one whole step removed.

And yet I don't send my video card back to Amazon when it breaks. If I get some stale chips I don't negotiate with 7-Eleven, I call that number on the bag and they get me a free coupon. Or I email MSI who sends me RMA packaging, or whatever...

I'm not saying WotC *must* do anything, only that it ultimately *is* ""their product"" and making customers whole and happy is as simple as giving them a digital PDF copy of what they already paid for gratis.

Those people would then go on to keep buying books. If forced to repurchase already once purchased products just because the media changed instead of being transferable. They are now more likely to just buy from a competitor and you sell some of them no books. And the ones you do strong arm into spending twice aren't going to have nearly as good customer satisfaction.

A PDF costs nothing, and makes you more money in the long run. Happy customers are spending customers. It's not like geeks hold back, we already buy everything we can afford to buy. For most people replacing entire library money doesn't just appear out of thin air. And if your library is gone might as well try something new instead of just replacing what you already read.

So it's not irrational for a customer to go upstream to  be made happy. Businesses should be happy they made that much effort and don't just go to the competitors.

This seems ridiculous it even needs explained."

"The royal families of Europe are a good case study, taking place over centuries, of what happens when you concentrate inherited power in a small group who then breed amongst themselves.

The results are decidedly mixed.

If the system, for instance, selects for ruthlessness or greed then you may find that you are perpetuating a ruthless and greedy system. But to claim that this state of affairs is just or unalterable is the fallacy known as argument from nature, or Social Darwinism. 

It can't possibly be the case that social and economic systems are straightforwardly the result of genetic predispositions, since historically they have varied so much. If genetic tendencies were primary, then ""the nature of nurture"" would be biologically fixed, and not variable. It follows therefore that man-made systems are not a straightforward reflection of genetics, but are subject to alteration and refinement."

"Reusable shopping bags and reusable produce bags are the two biggies besides your food choices. 

My SO works for a grocery chain so we have a zillion reusable shopping bags and my favorites are the insulated ones for cold items and the canvas ones. I always bring at least three, one insulated, one canvas, and one plastic flimsy one for backup. 

I purchased a set of cotton produce bags from Amazon. I know, not totally zero waste from the get go, but idk how to sew and they’ve already saved so much plastic in the year I’ve had them. The downside to cotton is that it absorbs moisture from things like lettuce and broccoli.  The good thing is that they are machine washable so I wash them every few weeks when I do dish towels and all that stuff. 

The next thing is purchasing items I know come in recyclable packaging and avoiding plastic. For example, yogurt tubs aren’t recyclable in my county so I stopped buying yogurt.  But I still buy a lot of canned food because I can recycle it.  Plastic jars aren’t recyclable in my area but glass jars are so anything I used to buy in a plastic jar I’ve switched to the glass jars. I also have to make an effort to not buy snacks and other foods that just don’t come in recyclable packaging. I try to plan my meals ahead of time based on less waste, which is largely vegetarian.  Rice, beans, potatoes, and pasta are my go tos now.  Oh, and not taking the free samples. I love free samples so they’re hard to pass up but... so much waste. "

You can use an external program called PlayPass to do this really easily with wildcards.  It is a real blessing to anyone using PlayOn since they lack the ability to use wildcards for their subscriptions.  It is available via Github and the developer has even come out of hiding twice (with nearly a year between last contact both times) to add features I requested.  Pretty awesome.

Compare Foods, Food World, and Li Mings are are remarkable grocery stores for their own reasons. Compare has very cheap meat and good produce, Food World has a bit of everything from all over the world (and you can buy a hundred pound bag of dried beans if that's what you're into), and Li Ming's is a an enormous asian grocery store in an old circuit city. 

If you're into drinks then Honeygirl Meadery, Bull City Ciderworks, and Brothers Vilgalys Spirits are a bit off the beaten path (full disclosure: am owner of Bros V). Durham Distillery is also great.

BRIEF UPDATE: We are in the middle of modding our primary DayZ server, and will be making the following changes in its initial release: Improved spawn locations, Stamina fix, dynamic Zombie hords, additional gear (military gloves, etc), No Crosshair in center screen, as well as keeping an active eye out out there for other popular mods while the Dev's continue to drop content every few weeks.

We will also be creating a second server that will be a WAR EVENT server. This ""Battle Royale"" style server will be a full mod where players can only spawn into the Current Battle city (Novo, NWAF, Novaya Petrovka, Cherno, or Electro) and players spawn in fully geared ready for immediate battle as one of over a dozen combat classes (Ghillie Sniper, M4 Infantry, Shotgun Medic, Mosin &amp; pistol combo, etc. This second server will also have crosshair turned off and have a stamina fix. Down the road we may even be able to add a ""FactionZ"" choice for your gear or clothing

=UN= Modding update: We have been granted permission from BI to host the types of servers that we selected and are in the process of processing the mods as we speak. On Monday Fragnet says our Server will be modified for us and at that point we should be able to put up our new Battle Royale style server and regular DayZ Server. The city location for our Battle Royale server will begin in the massive city of Novo. Expect to see players spawning in fully geared in one of a handful of military classes.(edited)  
\* We will be working on a stamina fix on both out servers.

"Yo, I wasn't going to post this story in this thread because I know I kind of deserved what I got, but it's relevant to your comment:

I was a pretty distracted student in high school, so I tended to talk \[quietly, but it's still rude\] to my classmates during classes when the teachers were lecturing or just when we were supposed to be quietly doing work. I often got away with it, or just got told by the teacher to shut up, because I had good grades. In French class, we had an old bag for a teacher (people called her the Lebanese Nazi, she was a little nuts). She liked to have long shouting rants whenever anyone did the tiniest thing wrong, or sometimes when no one did anything wrong and she seemed to have imagined some wrongdoing. But for some reason, she liked me, and she always let me get away with talking quietly during class as long as I did my work. 

But one day, the whole class was talking (I can't remember what started it, but it was the entire classroom of 32ish students) except for me because I was finishing some work. And that day, she gave me a detention for talking. Mind boggling."
"Pretty sure the devs went in and decided at random what to add and what to remove for rules. Like they didn't implement all the rules from the BASE rules but decided ""hey, let's implement advanced classes and their abilities that require some of the base rules we've excluded.""

 Like they combined the conversation persuade/intimidate skills (which is nice in a way) but then combine trickery skills but now allow you to use them other than stealth (not even Pickpocket, that I've seen so far but not many opportunities to try) unless it's class specific.

Also, love the wonderful trap I ran into for a quest reward. Not that having a trap be part of the reward be a problem since I'm playing an evil character and choosing to consort with evil things. But WHY THE FUCK is a small chest under a tree protected by a Finger of Death spell trap? like what? I kind of feel that's just a giant ""fuck you, you piece of shit for playing the game how we allow you to and want to encourage you to play how you want so now you have to lose one of your characters (or in my case reload) because you're a terrible person."" Why did this person have to hide this box out in the open like that if he was able to afford that kind of trap? or make it even. I feel like he's a huge badass on his own."

"Yeah, no shit it's a game, I'm glad you have literally no counter point other then ""is only gaem"" which is low key admitting it's fucking stupid. Story has to follow logic and so far this story has not.

However in the absence of Blizzard divulging us with intricate lore, what we're left to fill in the blanks with is what we know, Blizzard doesn't tell us that in WoW magic fireballs kill people, so we're left to sort of assume fire will do that, just like real life logic would dictate.

Blizzard doesn't tell us in WoW casually wiping out an entire race is a daily wartime activity, so we insert what we know to fill the blank, which is that it actually is a fucking war crime. Concepts like this aren't that hard. Until you, as a storyteller explain that something is not like you know it to be, you're going to assume that it IS.

At no point in this long rambling bout of insanity did you ever say the words ""My character"" until just now, you haven't been arguing a damned thing about any sort of perceived character viewpoint or in-game story direction, you were arguing in favor of the fucking concept of it, which is the entire fucking worrying portion.

"Thank you.  That was exactly my point and why I posted what I did.  I just posted this to someone else that expounds that point.

&gt;I feel like this tape just gets blown way out of proportion as if it's some kryptonite that it clearly isn't.  Trump was talking with a close friend and bragging.  He was likely embellishing his prowess and appeal as he is wont to do.  Locker room talk is an apt description.  He's talking big and blowing smoke up his buddy's ass about how much game he has.  Does this excuse his language and what he said?  Absolutely not.  It gives it context that the average person can relate to.  Not in the actual subject matter being discussed, but just the nature of the conversation itself.  

&gt;That right there is the key that many people don't seem to get.  We can all get up on our moral high horses about how crude and vile his comments were.  That does nothing when the average person hears this along with knowing the context and thinks, ""This is like when Tom was going on about his sexual conquests,"" or, ""You know what?  That sounds like when Karen is talking about how much of a cougar she is when 'pouncing' on these young guys.""  That is what a lot of people chalk that up to.  Continuing, 2 years later, to make a huge deal out of this comment when that has proven not to work for the last 2 years is just foolishness.  No amount of, ""But NORMAL don't speak that way,"" is going to sway people.  We learned that from the ""deplorables"" comment.  All it does is simply push people in the middle to vote R out of spite.  "

"Divorce. During the divorce my mother took half the pension, half the 401k. Never worked a day in her life. Oh and also 350,000 in cash. Left my dad financially ruined. She blew through all of that in 4 years. Complained to us about how there wasn’t enough money and we were going to lose the house. She did lose it. Came out with nothing, after multiple home equity loans.

I saw all the financial paperwork years after reconnecting with my father. He was giving her $3500 a month child support (more than I make after taxes with a finance degree).

She’s been mooching off some dude until my dad can pull his pension/401 without penalties.

This is the court system people. This is even AFTER she was arrested for assault/battery throwing a wine glass at my dads face.

Not to mention, the breadwinner pays for the lawyers. That was another 120 grand he had no say in....

She also stole my car. Kept it in her name to control me even though I paid 1500 down and 250$ a month (from ages 15-18). She sold it. Left me with no car and didn’t give me a cent. After all of this cash flow, she sStill lost everything. 


And the WORST part about why this is unfair? Every fucking family friends parents asks me to call her, Like she can do no wrong, or like none of this is supposed to hurt me because it’s my mother. When I can’t get them to shut up, I show them the voice recording of her telling me she’s going to hit herself and tell the cops I did it. That usually quiets them down.

"Exactly; it happens during REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep. If you’ve ever seen someone’s eyes flutter back and forth under their eyelids while they’re sleeping, this is the time they’re most likely dreaming.  

Also, your body cannot survive without REM stage of sleep. The more sleep deprived you are, the more you will dream once you finally do get sleep. If you stay up for, say 72+ hours straight, your body will begin to force you into mini-REM episodes (which would effectively be ‘dreaming’ while you’re awake; or more commonly, mild hallucinations)."

The ""East Coast Album dealing with death"" is what he was working on before Biggie released Ready 2 Die -- Pac claimed BIG had heard it and then stole the concept, so he reworked it into Me Against The World with some additional tracks ending up on R U Still Down.

Most of One Nation has been ""released"" by Daz on the Dillinger &amp; Makaveli album he put out -- others have leaked or released on Still I Rise, Better Dayz and Until The End of Time.

Makaveli album was released pretty much the way it was meant to be.

"A magical Bow-tie. While not in use this magical +1 bow transforms into a stylish bowtie adorned with 4 magical studs/gems. The bowtie grants the user advantage to persuasion checks (feel free to add charges to this if you like). Each time the user successfully charms or persuades someone who is against their view, opinion, idea, or argument (meaning you can't just pretend to be against them) the bowtie gains power in one of its magical studs. During combat the user may activate one of these studs during their turn to double the damage of a single attack rendering the stud inert. There are only 4 studs, once they are filled any further successful persuasion checks do nothing to alter them until they're inert once more.

"&gt;  0.618 is a rounded off approximation of the Golden Ratio (also known as the Greek letter Phi). If you were to do the math and write down the digits of Phi it would be and endless string of numbers.

This tidbit was missing from /u/Jesito324's  original explanation, yes. Though still not ""eli5"" (and yes, I understand that irrational numbers are not eli5-material to begin with), it at least addresses a giant gaping hole from the first explanation. 

It's also somewhat contradictory to his statement of:

&gt; Simply put, if we want to get an approximation for the golden ratio to a certain number of decimal places then it's guaranteed that a and b will both have to be larger than if we were to try and approximate another irrational number to the same accuracy.

If pi can be approximated to 3.14, then why is using .618 for the golden ratio not 'close enough'? Aren't they the same number of significant digits? How much more accurate is 3.14 to pi than .618 is to golden?

Furthermore, I don't think the explanation he gave of what the golden ratio is ties in well to 'why it's important for plant growth'. Again, if an approximation (.618) of it is good enough for all 'real world' calculations, why are we even assuming (apparently) that plants are somehow more precise?

I mean honestly, I feel like a better explanation would have been ""it creates a perfect spiral for stacking things to maximize coverage, be it of sunlight-to-leaves or seeds-to-distribution"" would have tied the whole thing together better."

That said.  It's a lot.  \*THAT\* said... it's less than you can handle.  Based on your history, you have a partner that's ready and willing, so I'd like to bulletize these points for you:

* You'll get through it.
* It's a lot.  
* Sometimes, it's going to suck.  
* There will be stupid fights between you.
* Take stock of said stupid fights and \*\*apologize\*\*... Even if you were wrong.  This is not the sword to die on.
* Split the load, if you can.  
* It's okay to irrationally hate your partner.  It's irrational.  Take stock later, and look at it with a clean mind.
* \*\*Most Importantly\*\* There are two teams: Parents and children.  Do \*NOT\* cross team lines.
   * Fight amongst your  team in private.  Even if you disagree with the decision.  It goes a long way later.

The last (primary) point, in my home, is the most important.  Even between parents and partners, there are different parenting styles, and different experiences, based on our own upbringing.  For instance:  

I was raised in a home of three rules (having 5 siblings myself, and fairly irresponsible parents): ""Parent's should not be blindsided by other parents, teachers, or police, with bad news that you've been a part of.""  If they were, and I was the reason for the visit, I was  in trouble.  My wife had a very different parent situation and home life from me... being a ""by the books, and straight A student.""

Differences aside, we make it through... worrying about things like bills... the things you should have a vested interest in!

"So imagine you need money. One way to generate money with very little risk is to sell parts of your company (stocks), which you then sell to people. If you own 51% of stocks, you have the controlling share, and thus either you own the company, or you are on the bord of directors having majority vote."

"You're citing a bunch of stuff that's pretty irrelevant to what I'm saying. She can love hip hop, be friends with rappers, and perform at Kanye's wedding. That still gives her 0 credibility to talk about hip hop culture.

I don't have a problem with her talking about Kanye, I have a problem with her using the term ""the culture"" as if she has any say or influence over the hip hop landscape. Listening to Lil Wayne don't give you a right to claim the culture lol.

Above all she's saying this to KANYE WEST. Kanye is one of the most popular and successful people ever in hip hop. Lana can come at him as a man or a friend. But she simply does not have the right to come at him and declare anything about the culture."

"Sorry to go all philosophical on this pretty innocent comment of yours, but try to look at it objectively--you only got to see the good and improved side of JM.

JM didn't deserve to live, much as we loved him.

"I had the almost same set up except for Zam instead of IG. For my successful try Zam died right away, R2 didn't stealth and Bossk wasn't stunned or blocked. Then it was a matter of big execute damage on Chewie. I then made sure to give my Bossk taunt and utilize Frenzy (Bossk gets 100%tm when another BH uses a special). Greedo took a turn and Threatened Han. That triggered frenzy and it allowed Bossk to mass attack on Chewie almost killing him. It was then Cad Bane turn and I thought about risking the biscuit and going all in on Chewie. I decided to Stun R2 instead just toe delay the stealth again. Boba then killed Chewie and popped the Contract.

From then on it was a controlled murder spree. First Lando because I was deathly afraid of a pumped up AoE that could wipe out Cad and Greedo easily. At that point I began using AoE attacks to regain health from the Debuffs. Lando died and then I killed Han. Then it was Leia and R2 VS four full health BH who weren't happy. I ultimately reveled in a 70k Execute crit on a yellow HP R2. "

"Since you just reached tier 5, I'd suggest the following (I omitted destroyers since you said you weren't comfortable with them):

* Giulio Cesare: tier V Italian battleship, hailed as one of the best shops tier-for-tier in the game

* Warspite: tier VI British battleship, a very stereotypical battleship in most regards. Excellent turn radius allows you to dodge torpedoes with ease.

* Oktobrskaya Revolutsiya: Tier V Russian battleship. Plays differently than all other battleships due to its limited number of damage control party consumables, but great gunnery and good armor. Note that this ship can be acquired for free through the Arsenal.

* De Grasse, tier VI French cruiser. I don't own her but I heard she is enjoyable to play. Fast and rapid-fire artillery.

* Scharnhorst, tier VII German battleship. I don't like recommending ships way above a player's max tier, but Scharn is an exception. Very easy to pick up and play; a bote for inexperienced and experienced players alike. Fast, rapid fire artillery, and torpedoes!

* Mutsu, tier VI Japanese battleship. A solid battleship in all respects. Rewards good play with accurate long-range gunnery and IMO is superior to all battleships at tier VI. 

If you change your mind about destroyers, Okhotnik and T-61 are good mid-tier premium destroyers. The former is a meme boat and the latter is the strongest DD at tier VI."
You're the one who is stupid.
"I would probably approach this as a practical problem you are looking for solutions for: you're pregnant, you have other kids too, and being able to give their baby the attention needed to keep her from crying is too much for you right now. Would the baby be able to cry it out for a bit in a safe environment, for example? What would the parents want you to do? It may just be that this arrangement isn't a good fit for either of you anymore. 

I'm kind of with your husband too. Going about this like they're doing something wrong with their child is not going to end well. And you really don't know that it's something they're doing. Some kids are just high needs and no amount of structured alone time is going to help it. I'm assuming you've been working with the baby too as a caregiver and if you've not seen any improvements, that also kind of supports that this might just be a high needs child. 

So I would approach this as it's a problem with the child's care right now, and have a discussion about the best way to fix this, but I wouldn't focus on this as a problem with how they're parenting. "

"I had a similar issue in that I live in an apartment and was finding ice baths to be insufficient. Even my bath tub wasn't helping getting it chilled in under 45min. Here's what I did to get an immersion chiller setup. I looked under my kitchen sink and saw where the cold water connected to the sink. I went to home depot and got a Tee valve, some PTFE Tape, and a 1.5 foot of flexible plumbing line. I basically unhooked the sink from the water line, after first turing off the water line. Connected the Tee valve in between them in the fashion that water would always be on to the sink and only on to the 1.5 ft line when the valve was opened. I had to get some adapters for the line to fit the input end of my immersion chiller. But it all worked out very cheaply and I have yet to flood my apartment. Oh, the PTFE tape is wrap around the threads of metal plumbing fixtures to help make the threading water tight."

"That's a fair stance, not everyone is going to like the same stuff, which is good, the world would be pretty boring if that was the case.

Rebels grew on me pretty quickly and I ended up enjoying it a lot, I still think The Clone Wars was overall a better show, but Rebels felt like a worthy successor to me, it also tied up some loose ends from TCW, which I appreciated.

Bottom line for me is this: Either this new show is entertaining, or it's not. If I decide it's not for me, then it's just not for me, that's fine. As I said before, Filoni has delivered two shows I've enjoyed a great deal, so at the very least I'm willing to give this new show a fair chance."

"No, typically these morons tend to go out with the intent to steal high powered cars for committing further crimes or more of the same crimes. They will arrive in a high powered performance oriented car, commit a burglary or sometimes aggravated burglary, get the keys or use various tactics to get a car with keyless entry started without them before they leave in convoy. 

They typically stick together because police will be searching for them as singular police vehicles, if the two cars are spotted then all that the crooks need to do is go two different ways and the officers have to make a decision which to follow. Whichever gets followed will use the power of their vehicle to get away, ditch the car if necessary and then be picked up by the others in the group. Sadly mobile phones make this tactic very effective for them to evade getting caught. But the great thing is that they often are pretty poor drivers so there's the advantage in the hands of the police. "

" Yeah, they're iffy. I don't think we ever spent enough time there to get a feel for everyday life. 

Climate is pretty harsh, with the possible exception of the Saldean coast.  I figure Minnesota/ Manitoba/ northern Ontario would be comparable.  Fairly short growing season means crops are at risk of getting bit by a late frost.  A couple bad years in a row and we could be staring at a famine. 

Then there's the trolloc situation.  Living under the threat of being eaten(or worse), particularly in the northern part of the country would be stressful. Everyone would have to live in fortified villages at minimum. Isolated farmsteads would be inviting a raid.  

The government is questionable.  We know they are basically feudal monarchies. We can infer heavy  taxation to pay for the large standing armies and extensive fortifications.

"Do you honestly think it’s a good idea to just ban players for toxicity from the game forever vs. just implementing a simple chat filter like most other games? I’ve supported Ubisoft for over a decade, put over a thousand hours into siege since day one, spent HUNDREDS of dollars on siege alone and I got permanently banned today after three years for being toxic in a COMPETITIVE 17+ VIDEO GAME! Do you honestly think that the adults who play your games feel the need you to start censoring the chat for them? Honestly I don’t think I have ever been this absolutely livid in my entire life. Ubisoft support has told me five times in a row that they can’t do anything and whenever I try to post this subreddit I am mob attacked by people telling me I deserved it because i’m a racist piece of shit. I am completely helpless in this situation since I am only one player of 35 million. So thanks Ubisoft, thanks for once again screwing me over. This will be the last time this ever fucking happens to me. I am done with your company. Assassins Creed, Far Cry, everything else I will never buy againn and I have been buying these games for the last decade. This is the final straw that just proves how fucking delusional and out of touch you are as a company. You continue to fuck up game after game and make poor decision after poor decision and at the end of the day the only people who are affected are the loyal fans. And for those of you who go “Just cuz u spent money doesn’t mean u get special trestment” Fuck you. Ubisoft is a business and they are here to make money and I  have given them so much of my money. Acting like they have some social obligation to police and censor free speech is pathetic. They make video games and then people buy and play them. Last I checked siege wasn’t a fucking daycare for little kids. I am a valued customer and my voice deserves to be heard. Banning after all that support is fucking horseshit and I want to warn other consumers that this is what Ubisoft rewards loyalty with.

It’s purely action focused. He’s there with you from the first game to his final moments.  Knowing that someone you played alongside with the whole story is no longer there due to the actions taken by your enemy adds a different type of emotional weight. 

You’ve probably experienced this in your life at some point if you’ve ever empathized with a stranger and felt their pain or joy before. Actions have emotional weight to them that words don’t which can apply to strangers.

"&gt; So am I exploited myself too?

No, you're selling yourself short. That doesn't mean you should ask strangers to make the same sacrifice. It's rude and exploitative, not racist. No one called you a racist so calm down."
"True.

Around 2 out of every 10,000 black Americans actually goes back to Africa to reside in any capacity (work, school, or actual permanent residency.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_settlement_in_Africa

I should have been more clear that it does happen. It's just exceptionally rare.

But this does give me the opportunity though to illustrate a propaganda piece that comes up at the top of the results on Google when looking for information on this subject.

https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/african-americans-moving-africa-180116092736345.html

Many statements in that article are simply wildly false racist propaganda.

For example it talks about escaping racial violence. Racial violence by whom? Because looking at the actual real world statistics, blacks commit around 20 times as much violence against whites per capita as whites do against blacks. With black on white violence being so pervasive, that despite only comprising about 12% of the US population, blacks commit the majority of interracial violence between blacks and whites. Or violence in general, as 91% of homicides of blacks are committed by other blacks, at around 12 times the rate of non-hispanic whites, and more than triple the rate of any other racial or ethnic demographic in the United States, even those with equal or worse poverty levels, and even those with worse gang affiliation rates on top of those poverty levels.

The reality is also that police aren't shooting black people at higher rates than white people once you actually control for what the victims themselves were actually doing. As black Americans commit far more crime by rate per capita than whites, attack police far more often, try to kill police far more often, etc... by rate per capita. And while far more whites are killed by police than blacks are each year, blacks are killed at a higher rate specifically due to the consequences of their own actions. There is no increased risk to people who actually obey the law, don't try punching police, taking their guns, trying to kill them, etc. If they actually behave ""like white people"" do on average, they're less likely than white people are be killed by police.

&gt; You might not have electricity, but you won't get killed by the police either. 

That statement is simply absurd. It would take police 40 years to kill as many black people as black people themselves kill in this country in 1 year. Every year. And again, police aren't killing random black people for being black. They're killing criminals who try to kill police, or in rare instances, ones who are mistaken for someone trying to kill police, like a youth who pulls a fake gun after police are called by other people who were robbed by and threatened by this ""armed"" youth... when it turns out the gun was fake, etc.

The idea that there is any remotely substantial risk to the average black person from police when it comes to their lives is absolutely absurdly counter-factual racist propaganda.

Even that article lets on that there's still serious classism there, that she's riding on a class based privilege from her privileged upbringing in America and from being American, and still having to deal with a far more sub-standard quality of living, all so that she can feel better about being away from evil white people... which in part seems borne from going to an all black college where she seems to have been indoctrinated with absurd counter-factual narratives about who is actually killing whom at what rates and for what reasons in the US. The idea that she is fleeing any real threat to her life in the US for the safety of Africa is practically delusional in its counterfactual absurdity, unless she's literally running around armed committing crimes and attacking police etc.

So apparently there are some racists so delusional about the state of affairs in the United States that they actually do go back to Africa in some capacity to be away from white people. Less than half of one percent of the black community.

If I were in a country that I felt hated me, where I felt I didn't belong, where I truly believed that my life was in constant peril... and somewhere else was a country full of people ""just like me"" where I felt I'd belong, be safe, etc... you can be sure I'd leave and go there as soon as possible. I'd want to raise my family there.

But almost every black person I've talked to is actually scared of Africa and sees it as sort of a sh** hole. (My hometown has a large black population, at the eastern portion of the greater metropolitan area, its own city, is 78% black, where I've lived for a number of years of my life, etc. Having also worked and gone to school with substantial numbers of black people, had black roommates, friends, etc.) They're afraid they'll get diseases, or get murdered, or have to live in some ""third world"" country where they'll lack the basic amenities they take for granted here.

Of course they love to imagine that Africa is only that bad because of white people. Just look at the arguments surrounding the release of Black Panther... or the arguments about Egypt and ""kings and queens"" etc... and you'll start to uncover rather pervasive and absurd amounts of racism within the black community. Ideas that sub-Saharan black west Africans actually built the entire Egyptian empire and whites have just lied about it... and the idea that all black Americans today would be ""kings and queens"" in Africa if not for white people having stolen them and taken them to America... which is why they actually refer to themselves as kings and queens now (if that has ever puzzled you.) Or the idea that it is only because of white colonialism that Africa is still a sh** hole today... despite other people and countries having actually benefited from the imposition of western values, government, education, economics, rule of law, etc.

This reality is also the reason why black people who actually come here from Africa today tend to look at black American ""natives"" as trash. As lazy, ignorant, racist losers. They can't believe the opportunities that black Americans squander. These recent immigrants take advantage of these great opportunities and get well educated, get good careers, and tend to primarily or even exclusively socialize with, date, and marry non-black Americans.

In fact the last time they actually checked, something like 50% of all ""black"" college students were actually immigrants or from immigrant families, despite comprising only around 8% of the black population. ""Black American culture"" simply doesn't value education and hard work remotely the way that these immigrants do. They don't see or value the actual level of opportunity they actually have... with more financial support than whites or Asians, far lower standards to be accepted (a black person can score several hundred points below an Asian person who got a perfect score on the SAT and still get in ahead of that Asian person, all else being equal, because admissions are weighted against Asians and even whites and in favor of blacks above all else.)

""Black culture"" in the United States is a deeply racist, self destructive culture obsessed with racial identity, hatred of and rejection of perceived ""white"" culture (actually just general American culture built on color-blind western culture; meritocracy, liberal democracy, free markets, science, etc), which is why east Asian Americans actually out-perform white Americans educationally and economically, and why the most common surname for Doctors is Patel, not a European name, etc. Because for those who actually work for it you can achieve great things here. But wallow in delusional racism, stuck in a past that hasn't existed for over half a century even in the case of civil rights (which also affected Chinese severely, who faced violence, discrimination, anti-miscegenation laws, etc... and only gained equal rights at the same time blacks did, and yet in the same half century since have surpassed whites while blacks have only gotten much worse... going from having higher rates of marriage to having by far the highest rate of single motherhood and lowest rate of married households, etc), and more than 150 years in the case of actual slavery... and made absurd statements like

&gt; No matter where you were sold or left the port, Senegal or Ghana, no one can be certain where you came from. 

She woman wasn't sold. Or shipped out of Africa. Her parents weren't. Or her grandparents. Etc. She is not a victim of anything other than her own racist ignorance and delusions of persecution unsupported by factual reality. This victim mentality in black Americans; that they themselves were slaves, etc... is one of the largest problems they face.

So for those who ""go back"", when they're sitting there in their corrupt unstable countries without reliable access to the most basic things like clean water and electricity, at least they can feel safe in having gotten away from the evil white man and his oppressive and racist western civilization where apparently everyone else seems perfectly capable of having world leading quality of life regardless of their skin color if they actually bother to work for it. Not sit around spouting fallacious racist hate and asserting imagined entitlement without having to work for it because some distant ancestor of theirs was actually a real victim of a real crime done by someone else at some other time in history long before this person was ever born.

Again... this romanticizing of tribal people and this idea that somehow ""western culture"" isn't a VAST improvement over it is simply ridiculous. Almost dangerously so. One can always be a little sad to see unique cultures lost, but that's progress. Document it carefully in a book for future reference and then move on. Leave the past where it belongs as we continue to move forward."

"As a CMO, they would of course be familiar with other species, but some may decide to limit their familiarity with only those species under their direct care. As the other poster pointed out, tech helps. A lot. Think if today's docs had a tricorder and a hypospray. The tricorder can actually tell the dr what is really going on and the hypospray can be loaded with whatever is necessary to alleviate the condition. Today they are toying with the idea of 3D printed medication cocktails catered to a specific patient rather than give them 3 or more medications that have to amplify or neutralize each other. Tech is amazingly slow to advance in the medical field, but much of that is a hesitancy to experiment on living people. 50yrs ago we were just starting conquering simple childhood diseases. 50yrs before that the flu killed millions around the world. The first steps have been taken, but we have a long jouney to go.

Another point about training: today a lot of training involves not memorizing everything, but learning how to find the answer elsewhere. I took my 1yr old daughter to the ER because her eye was swelling unexpectedly. After examining her he left the room and came back 15min later. He had a Google page printout with the condition and admitted that it was the first time he had ever seen it, and had only heard about once or twice before. Tech to the rescue."

"My sister's ex is trying to have her imprisoned for his own failure to comply with something court ordered.

Every few months he takes her to court to fight for custody over their daughter, because he thinks somehow it will negate the 10 years of child support he hasn't paid. He always tells them she doesnt let him see their daughter and all kinds of crazy shit like shes on drugs and out partying all night. Every time this happens she submits to drug testing, has to bring in co workers and pay stubs to prove she is at work and not partying, and that their daughter actually sees him every other weekend (she has to take her to him, as he refuses to have anything to do with pickup or drop off, and calls the police if anyone shows up even 5 minutes early to get her.)

Last time the court told her to just keep up visitation, and because he raised a stink about it, to get a paternity test done and have him added to the birth certificate. Well, dumbass has refused to submit to a paternity test. And filed a motion this past week to have her imprisoned for failure to comply with a court order of having him added to the birth certificate. She has one week to get it done, or she goes to jail.

&gt;You no longer experience egotistical emotions such as jealousy and hatred although they can still arise from the residue of your ego but you can now observe them and no longer energise them.

Hatred and jealousy are actually from the ego.

You can, if you want to, go further:

 - Hatred arises from not seeing the ignorance in others.  If you see their ignorance that lead to their decisions, you're going to have a very hard time having hatred for anyone.

 - Jealousy arises from comparing yourself to others.  Imposter syndrome too.  If you see the uniqueness in every situation, you can make comparisons without conceit, making jealousy a thing that is impossible to experience."

I did not use lidocaine before insertion because my cream is compounded and has both estrogen and lidocaine. I apply it twice a day to the vestibule but they told me not to do it before dilators or insertion because they don’t want the estrogen internal. The idea is just to calm the nerves in general over time.

I’ve always been curious about what just lidocaine would do. I did use Foria Awaken, a CBD oil, for the first time, right before I dilated. I didn’t include it in my story because I honestly couldn’t tell if it made a difference (everything felt kinda hot and tingly when I applied it, but no real difference with the dilators) and I didn’t want it to seem like that was what made the difference with the PIV sex.

But I have to be careful to not ask too much or expect too much because that can EASILY be draining to the other person. Understandably so.

So to answer your question more directly... that’s really up to them and what they’re able to do without feeling drained or overwhelmed depending on how long the time periods it effects you are.

"&gt; On top of this, the high reproduction rate of viruses means that they are better suited to avoid mutational load.

This isn't exactly right.  I think you mean that a large population size can help slow the accumulation of mutations by drift.  With HIV, however, this is greatly diminished by selective sweeps: non-adaptive mutations are quickly fixed in very large populations by hitchhiking; the effective population size is much smaller than the real population.

In the context of genetic entropy, Sanford's nearly-neutral mutations should hitchhike to fixation even more rapidly in such organisms.  This predicts more rapid ""degeneration"" and extinction (especially in the presence of selective sweeps), which we don't see.  Otherwise, we would be able to cure HIV simply by using anti-virals to induce repeated selective sweeps."

"I mean, if people want to ship it, sure go wild. 

But as far as canon is concerned I feel like nothing's been established in canon. It's possible that something is being foreshadowed, but that's a very different animal than an established attraction on either side.

My read is that they're both intrigued by each other: 

Keith because Acxa is the first Galra he had a chance to interact with that didn't end in bloodshed and because she's continued to not kill him. (Though I'm not sure he realized she was the pilot of the Sincline ship that came closest to shooting him down.)

Acxa because... It's unclear. Which I find exciting and trust (hope!) that it's not a crush. (I take Ezor's and Zethrid's comments as them giving her shit. They're reducing whatever interest she has in Keith to a school-girl crush because it's a good way to mock their former leader not because it's time for her to realize her true feelings or something.) 

I'm not an Emperor Keith theorist, but I do think Acxa is intrigued by something political or leader-ly in him. Something she may have seen in Lotor before he let her down. So something that might lean towards bright-eyed fervor, but not in a romantic, let's nestle together with hot chocolate, way."

"It's getting real hard to rally for a buff to Stormtrance in PvE with all the recent Golden Gun/Nova Bomb discussions.

Of all Warlock supers the only one in a worse place rignt now imo is top tree Dawnblade, but I guess that would be a much harder fix given that what makes bottom tree good is a perk specific to that branch.

I'm just arguing with you..calm down, don't post comments if you don't like when someone is responding to you.

How do you know they leave and that they don't keep reading? you know, there are readers who don't  post any comments...

&gt;It's even acknowledged on other media from what I've seen (and no I'm not going to go digging for them).

If you don't have source then what you are saying means nothing, nothing more nothing less, and I acknowledged there was a drop, just not as big as you are saying.

Ok but that doesn't change the fact it's not even close to be true.

They didn't left, they keep reading while bashing it, not the same thing.

&gt;I don't see what's your problem. It doesn't hurt anyone what I'm saying nor am I bashing the series

Quit crying, I'm just responding to a misinformation.

Immigration is fine in small amounts, the mass immigration that we are seeing is absolutely terrible for the native population.

Res +3, Bowbreaker 3, Breath of Life 3, and a HP/Res 1 seal that I have as a placeholder. I found a normal, no-refine Nowi in Training Tower and she has 27 res and 49 hp. On initiation, Julia does 63 damage without atk buffs and no special activation. 

To make double sure of this, I found another Nowi in the Training Tower with 45 hp and 30 res. Using the same Julia, she deals 60 damage against Nowi and kills her on initiation. 

And to make sure that this pattern wasn’t a coincidence, I went and found a third Nowi in Training Tower. She has 44 hp and 28 res. Julia kills her on initiation and deals 62 damage.

Unless the Nowi has stacked res, more hp, and/or more merges, it’ll be hard for her to *not* get killed by a decently built Julia. Especially one that is +atk and built with deathblow."

If I rush again this time, I know the new relationship won't have the sturdy foundation I want. Every time I feel tempted to rush, I imagine how much better it will be if I take time.

"You are such an awesome person for asking that question, thank you. I wouldn’t feel right asking for anything, but your gesture is really warming. 

As far as what you were saying, I see nothing wrong with being born into affluence as long as you remain down to earth and treat others equally. It’s in the same boat as being born with really good looks. These things are all handed to us at birth, and they help a lot, but the only thing that should truly define us is how we treat ourselves and others.

I think you should be grateful for any gift you have in life. We all have problems, but in this society it’s important to remember that everyone’s problems vary in magnitude. Just because you might hate your life, it doesn’t mean you understand how much worse a different person is doing.

If I were rich, I would probably still feel the same about my problems, but I would also try and be humbled by the blessing of financial stability. Money is such an important tool in life and nobody is a fool for stockpiling it in this dog-eat-dog world. I just hope wealthy voters start to think past what they can do to maximize their returns and consider the government more as a way to help society. I often see democrats looking out for the poor, while republicans aim at helping the rich by convincing voters that it’s in their best interest.

If I were rich, I’d still want to have a government that made me pay my fair share of taxes because I would understand how easy I have it compared to those living in poverty. I would consider it my form of giving back, since charity is such a noble virtue. I wouldn’t worry about people milking the system, that’s just a fact of life. All that would matter to me is that my society did what it could to help every citizen live a normal and healthy life without dying from stress over paying the bills or a lack of healthcare. 

You don’t have to have expensive things to live well. It’s so sad that the greed of the wealthy job creators has made it nearly impossible for the average citizen to make it without having a special education or skill set. I understand that some people will never have the ability to become well-off in the world, but I’d love for them to at least be able to work at a grocery store and successfully eat, pay rent, and go to the doctor."

"For changing the keyboard backlight you would have to do some extreme keyboard disassembly, and while I'm sure that it is theoretically possible, I'm pretty sure that it would take weeks and several killed keyboards before you got it to work.

As far as the electronics go, ther's no reason for it not to work. It would be as simple as desoldering all of the backlight LEDs and replacing them with red ones of the same size. That said, you'd have to get down to the LEDs before you could even think about doing that."

"&gt;This model still has regular releases of new realms, but allows (possibly even encourages) players to transfer between them (for free) depending on progression rate. By default, you stick to the same progressive realm, keeping your established server community. But if you or your guild are progressing quickly, you can transfer up to a realm on the next tier of content. If you’re progressing slowly, you can transfer to a realm on a later release schedule, buying you more time on the current tier.

No fucking way this happening. Most players want a stable community on a server, not a revolving door.

On the other hand Blizz want his sweet transfer money if you want to move to another server"

"That's not luck. Picard takes measured risks with his crew and his ship. The price of building trust and goodwill is that risk. When he takes the Enterprise-E to Earth in First Contact, he's risking his ship and crew so he can accomplish something good, but there's shooting so we don't think twice about calling it heroism.

Approaching the unknown with vulnerability risks the same things, and seeks to accomplish the same good, but because our characters aren't shooting anything, we don't consider it heroic or justified.

It is."

Those drivers are nonetheless the minority. Most UberX drivers have a decent general idea of where they're going, but are reliant on GPS for specific routing and details. I've taken Ubers/Lyfts (definitely mostly Uber) probably over a thousand times in the last 5 years in Canada, the US and Europe, and this picture people paint of a bunch of unbelievably dangerous drivers just reeks of low sample size to me. How many Ubers have you taken to form your impression of their drivers?"

"This is filled with biased subjective statements based around definitions established only by yourself on what a ""rework"" means. 

The Aatrox one especially sounds like you basically frankenstein-ed together the collective squeeling of the Aatrox main's subreddit without giving credence to in any valid counterpoints such as the fact that Riot had absolutely no intention of ever letting a Drain-tank attack speed melee champion remain in the game because of the obvious balance implications. 

Also: 

&gt; Akali's shroud, the ""**true**"" invisibility however, is one of the most unhealthy game mechanics in the game. It turns much more to ""Did the Akali misplay?"", rather than ""Did I outplay her?"" 

A subjective statement leading into an even greater subjective statement. The second sentence is particularly worthless because defining the difference between misplaying and outplaying is largely in the eye of the beholder and the context of the situation."

I like Clothes Mentor but they vary a lot based on location and the types of neighborhoods they are in! They are sort of like Goodwills in that way — but with more selective brands and clothing that is in better shape. The prices are reasonable  — higher than goodwill but lesser than ThredUp. They are nice to have around especially if you have clothes to sell. The one near me is pretty persnickety about what they take but I find lots of cute things there!
"Its definitely a shit test. I've gotten this too a few times, but not many, as I tend to go after younger women. But when it does happen, I just tell them, ""So? you seem like a cool person that would enjoy Indian food/this movie/this event, and I just want to hang with you."" That usually seals the deal for me. Its when these older women start throwing shade is when I have a harder problem. 

For instance, I'm sort of an intern at my work right now. And I was in a team building workshop with a bunch of others, mostly white people. And this older white woman starts getting real close to me. She's one of those blonde chicks who's in her mid 30's and still has a good body. 

And when she would speak, I'd give her ""the look"" lol. I'm sitting next to the refreshment/coffee stand, so she'd periodically come over, and I'd definitely make it known that I'm looking at her body lol. 

And during group building exercises, she would periodically come over to where I'm at and get close to me. Like real close to me. While I'm huddled over the table doing the group thing, she would make room by nudging me out to see what we're doing. So she's right in front of me slightly bent over, and I'm just there chillin lol. 

Or she would come right next to me, like touching forearms next to me, and we'd get into that awkward silent moment. It got so bad that others started noticing, so I just move over to the other side of the table lol. 

But the funny thing is, during lunch, I see her in Chipotle. I'm with another woman, and this woman says something about cooking/cleaning to this white girl in everyday casual talk, and the white girl loudly bloats out, ""of course I know all of that; I have a kid"" like she wanted me to know that. 

I still see her here and there, but she's always giving me the bitch face now. Like no talking or even acknowledging me. And the funny thing is, I've spoken to other people about her, and they all tell me that she's one of the coolest people there. But to me, I just don't see that. Maybe I waited too long to make my move or something. But I'm not trying to bang white girls at my work lol; that shit's dangerous lol. "

"Unfortunately the owners of Netflix would quite rightly fly into a raging fit if Marvel were to move any of the characters established on its streaming service to the Disney streaming service.

EDIT: I am not sure why I got downvoted for this.  Legally there is only four different types of shows that the Disney streaming service can provide.

1) Stuff directly related to the Avengers like the Scarlet Witch series.  War Machine and Falcon are good candidates because they could never get their own movies.  I imagine Hawkeye will eventually get his own movie in theaters where he is training Kate Bishop to be the new Hawkeye and that this will then spin off into a Young Avengers franchise.

2) PG-13 horror.  There is strictly no R rated stuff allowed on the Disney streaming service but a Blade series in which Blade finds out he is a father and that his daughter is like him, a vampire that walks during the day, has been rumored for a long time.  Wesley Snipes has been actively encouraging these rumors.  Other possibilities are a Ghost Rider series and a Moon Knight series.  Both Ghost Rider and Moon Knight have been pitched as Netflix series.  Their subject matter seems too dark for the movies.

3) Extremely family friendly stuff like New Warriors or Kamala ""Ms Marvel"" Khan.  A Kamala Khan series has been rumored for a long time and was probably pitched to ABC.  Marvel has probably given up trying to pitch new series to ABC, Freeform, Hulu or Netflix.  Other possible series would be a series that focuses on Justice and Firestar or a White Tiger series.  White Tiger is something else that was supposedly pitched as a Netflix series.

4) New characters like She-Hulk, Nova and Namor.  With She-Hulk and Namor they would be getting around the problems with Universal.  With Nova they would be getting around the problem of introducing yet another cosmic franchise after Thor, Guardians and Captain Marvel.  

I suppose they could do a Ravengers series with Sylvester Stalone but I rather thought that would be a movie.

It is really hard to say what they could make into a movie for theaters and what they could stream on line."

"http://victimsofcrime.org/docs/default-source/ncvrw2015/2015ncvrw_stats_urbanrural.pdf?sfvrsn=2

&gt;The FBI reports the 2012 rate of violent crime known to law enforcement within metropolitan areas was 409.4 per 100,000 persons. The rate of violent crime per 100,000 persons in cities outside metropolitan areas was 380.4, and for non-metropolitan counties it was 177.0.1

"GSP was a lot better at initial head movement than Rory, but if he didn't have the best reactive takedowns ever, a lot of the guys he fought probably would have been able to force him into pocket exchanges and overwhelm him.  But they didn't do that because exchanging with GSP pretty much meant spending the rest of the round on your back.  Rory can time reactive takedowns, but he's not anywhere near as clean at finishing as GSP, and he needs a lot more time to get a decent read on when to shoot them, his timing isn't as good, and he can't set them up proactively like GSP can."

From what I've seen in benchmarks the only way for the 2600 to match or slightly exceed the 8400 in games is with an x470 motherboard, overclocking to 4.2-4.3ghz+ and buying 3200mhz RAM, and at this point you're spending like $60-70+ more than you would on an ideal i5-8400 build."

If I killed 30 baby chickens a year because of some preference, that wasn't food related, I'd be a psychopath. 

Imagine if every time you went to get a dozen eggs, you could either pay 2$, or kill a baby and save 1$. The people who kill the baby are kind of psychotic. But that's what I, and many others, do.

"Contact the local police. Campuses should be working in conjunction with them anyways, but often they opt to handle these things ""in house"" to avoid any negative press. Go with your friend into the local police station. Tell them you want to talk to a detective to report a sexual assault. That's all you should have to say, but if it's a small town they might try to get more info out of you or question whether you've notified campus security. Don't let them dissuade you. Insist on speaking to a detective to officially report your sexual assault. If they still try to push you back to the school take down that officers name and badge number and (kindly) explain that you'll be filing a complaint against them as well. Then, if all else fails, go to the media. DM a reporter at your local news station, tell them what's going on and ask if they can meet with you to discuss your experience anonymously. "

Ad— Ad Mortem Inimicus?
"My mom worked as a forensic psychologist who was tasked with helping sociopaths (serial killers and rapists) the difference between right and wrong. One day, a patient of hers suddenly tried to beat her to death. Where was the security guard at the time (who was supposed to be there)? Flirting with another psychologist. So now, she’s on disability (with her head trauma, PTSD, PCS, and movement issues) and she gets meager worker’s comp payments monthly. 

But that’s not all—recently, her landlord threatened to report her to workmen’s comp for fraud (whereby she would, if convicted, lose her income, and get potential he criminally charged) for helping his own aging/disabled mother with a  household chore. As a thank you, he decided to refund $10 of her rent using Zelle (which she didn’t even notice hit her account). Making it—arguably—paid work. 

He’s threatening to do this because he suddenly wants to live in the apartment himself. Giving my mom 30 days to get a new place? No way! She had to be out immediately, or he threatened to carry out the phone call. Now she’s homeless—living with a friend (she can’t live with me because of occupancy restrictions) with no place to go, and her furniture in storage. 

It’s makes me sick. She deserves that income after her hard, thankless work with the criminally mentally-ill, and how she was protected when she was supposed to be. 

And, again, that’s not all. I recently discovered that this guy had been charging her 4x the value of the falling-apart and neglected apartment. He knew that her brain damage made it so she couldn’t do online calculations anymore, and he took advantage of that disability. (She was so stubborn in not letting me see her statements; arguing that she had it “under control” and had “other friends” helping her figure out the numbers.) 

What was the chore she did? She helped his mother place some new tiles on the floor, and fought through her physical and cognitive pain to be neighborly.

Anyway—ugh.

"That’s not my view of justified. In this sense, I am using it to mean something like the dictionary definition “having, done for, or marked by a good or legitimate reason”. I think God is justified in taking people’s lives, I don’t see it as a totalitarian dictatorship. This is more so my line of reasoning. 

1. Suppose God is morally perfect, omnipotent, and omniscient.
2. If God kills a human being, then God has justifiable reasons for doing so or the above assumption is false.
3. God has killed a human being.
4. Thus, God has justifiable reasons for killing human beings.

"No, no, no. This series is a real nonsense.

It looks pathetic. It is just an example of the lack of imagination in the world of television, so they repeat with a character as popular as Sabrina, the teenage witch with Melissa Joan Hart.

This series will only serve to enlarge the original series and get a quick cancellation.

It is worrisome the need they have to make bad versions of everything original, both in Hollywood and on television, and that they do not leave space for new and original creations. Almost all the series released are unfortunate, like this one. Melissa Joan Hart is in fact, SABRINA.

So what will they think is a proportionate response to a woman telling them to get out of the women's bathroom? Hitting her? I wouldn't be surprised. "

"I know a lot of smaller framed, lithe, thin women who put on significantly more weight than they were “supposed” to. Pretty much of them lost it and I still can’t believe it when they say they gained as much as they did. No one would have ever known. Some of them lost it overnight and for others it took a while. Everyone is different. 

I’ve stayed within the recommended guidelines (but on the higher side) but I have noticed, at a month left to go, my weight has really plateaued.

Don’t beat yourself up about it. Also, I’d avoid those Instagram people and celebrities like Hilaria Baldwin. Maybe they do look that good “post-baby” but I have a feeling a lot of these women are photoshopping the hell out of their photos for likes! Also, a lot of them are wealthy, have personal trainers and chefs. If we all had access to things like that then I’m sure we’d have those “post-baby bodies” in no time too.

Nope.    Check out the struck out (removed) section on page five of this travesty of an initiative.  They *specifically* also removed the requirement that the list of prohibited people be kept up to date. 

Saying it ""only"" adds another class of weapon to that is demonstrably incorrect.

&gt; semi-automatic assault rifles 

...such as a .22?  The entire *existence* of the term ""Semi-automatic assault rifles"" as the duplicitous authors defined it, is about as meaningful as calling all automatic vehicles ""automatic war craft"" simply because they have the same mechanics as a tank.

"I feel Nuka World's focus on being evil was an attempt to compensate for the lack of choice in the main game. Particularly the lack of opportunity to make evil choices. The whole start of the game was based around you having to help The Minutemen. It was like the start to New Vegas, in Goodsprings, accept you were forced to side with the townsfolk. The start to Fallout 4 would have been so much better if you could have sided with the raiders in Concord. But no. You need to pay for DLC for the option to be morally ambiguous, but even then, in Nuka World you are forced to be evil or miss out on all the DLC's content. "

"&gt; am I likely to run into obstacles with renting a house for that period?

That's between you and the landlord I guess? Not something immigration would get involved in.

Again, this might work once. Like, when you try to come the first time and say you're staying for six months, they'll say ""How do we know you're not just going to try to stay and live up here?"" and then you can say ""Well, my lease starts in the States on this date"" and that*might*  be enough (although if that's the *only* tie to the States you can show, it might not be). But if you do it again, they'll almost definitely see you as trying to circumvent the system. 

I think if this is something you want, it's going to be a long-term process. Maybe it'll mean giving up self-employment to find someone who will sponsor you for a work visa. Maybe it will mean carefully documenting your self-employment in the States for a few years so you can apply for EE through the skilled workers programme. But unfortunately it's not going to be just heading up and telling them you're looking to stay but that you promise you'll totally go home after and then trying to do the same again a few months later.

"That’s what the adcomms said on Friday during the webinar.

Then someone asked what if the PS was relevant. And they said to just submit your PS as your AnBryce essay. I agree that it conflicts online reports. But this was straight from NYU this past Friday 

Basically they said there is a chance the person reviewing your app won’t read your ps. So if it is critical to your AnBeyce app you should consider submitting it as your essay.

(This probably all only applies to the first stage. If you make it to the interviews then I am assuming they will read your PS as well)"

"&gt;Most reasonable people consider the act of murdering children to be evil, almost entirely irrespective of the situation.

Ad populum fallacy. Just because most people think something doesn't mean it's true.

What makes killing children evil? Can killing children be good or morally neutral in some circumstances? 

Is abortion evil? What do 'most reasonable people' think about that?

&gt;Good - possessing or displaying moral virtue

What are the moral virtues? How do they apply to killing children?

&gt;How can this be justified?

You've just assumed it's evil for God (or anyone) to kill children--it's this that needs to be justified. What moral framework supports this conclusion, why should we use it or believe it's true?"

"Since it's getting crowded in the original post, and I need to explain why a lower level seal would have worked,   
 here's a reply to keep it less cluttered. Updated score of 17.4: [https://youtu.be/F7xSPNoJjI4](https://youtu.be/F7xSPNoJjI4)

F!Celica - 16.4 + 1 (iron sword) = 17.4

4 Star Nino - 13.7 + 3 (gronnblade) = 16.7

Linde - 14.7 + 2 (elthunder) = 16.7

3 Star Selena - 13.9 + 1 (reposition) + 2 (hone speed2) = 16.9

Total score = 17.4

Nino has a support with Eirika, but there is no Eirika, so no stat boosts.

Selena has Hone Speed 3 seal, but Hone Speed 2 is all that's necessary. Here are the following instances where Hone Speed 3 has an impact, and why it would still work if it's Hone Speed 2.

Nino under the influence of Spur Speed 2 (which I tested using the seal) fails to kill the lance infantry by 2 damage due to no actual buffs to increase Gronnblade damage, and fails to double with Hone/Spur Speed 1 (Lance Infantry has 35 speed after the Hone Speed 3 boost from Cleric, Nino has 37 base speed, Hone/Spur Speed 2 provides +3 speed). Therefore, Hone Speed 2 provides the speed necessary to double, and the damage boost through Gronnblade needed to deal the remaining 2 damage. 

Linde does not need the speed boost at all to double and kill Xander or the sword infantry (as seen in previous attempts). Therefore, the effect is irrelevant.

Lastly, the Cleric at the end takes an extra 2 damage from Nino due to Hone Speed 3 compared to Hone Speed 2. However, it is not necessary, as F!Celica provides more than enough damage to make up for the 2 damage.

Therefore, Hone Speed 2 would work.

&amp;#x200B;

This score could probably be lower, I just need to find a lower BST sword infantry for baiting the right side that doesn't double or get doubled by the enemy sword infantry, and can take 2 hits from green cav and do enough damage to either orko it or let nino finish it off.

When we developed tools that made it easier to kill animals we also developed traits that made it easier to process animal products. That has nothing to do with something being “more or less healthy.” "

"Pitbulls were bred to take down bulls and other large animals such as bears. When those blood sports fell out of fashion, they were adapted for dog fighting.

Think of it this way. Dogs who were bred for retrieving still love to play fetch. Dogs bred for herding still have that instinct. Pitbulls are no different. They still have that innate aggression inside and can snap with little to no warning. Couple that with their size and strength and you have a potential killing machine. Fuck pitbulls and their nutjob owners. "

Some people do acid (for the sake of simplicity, let's put this in the place of sitting down and thinking things through), and they come out of it with an understanding of connection, the necessity of love and compassion, not simply for your fellow humans, but all life.

Other people do acid, and, perhaps they find new ways to enrich themselves, to hoard wealth, to undermine the well being of the collective, of future iterations of life.

Or, perhaps it IS a matter of thinking things out. Maybe acid will convert the unwilling, but the problem is a fundamental unwillingness to think (also, probably an understandable unwillingness to do enough psychedelics to achieve ego death + jarring chemical change in perspective).

Conservatism goes hand in hand with the religions of old, and these provide religious answers where, in their absence, questions would otherwise find good and useful answers (in the form of better and better questions of our own). Also, if you're used to having your fundamental answers provided for you, rather than scratching at them, deeply, for years, then perhaps the good and useful nature of the mind suffers, also.

Anyway, my mind is no spring chicken, either. Actually, fun fact, I was a Christian until I was 21. I was terrified of even THINKING a doubt against God, because I believed Him to be not into that sort of shit. I digress.

I just don't get the whole 'Obama is a satanic pedophile, his wife is a man, and Donald J. Trump is not only a genius, but he has the well being of America as his number one concern'.

How do you think that, or anything near that?

In my book, you can look at all the 9/11 stuff, Bush, Bin laden Family, Cheney, you can see those old videos, and think maybe something fucky went down. Understandable.

But this Q stuff, and to a lighter degree, to just believe Trump is a compassionate genius? Given the nonstop, super-consistent output of information that everyone has relatively easy access to?

If the order of magnitude jump from Bush to Trump is indicative of the next republican president... it's possible that the U.S. will be governed by a giant , screaming, purple pterodactyl that flies the streets at all hours, eating people at will. The president afterward? The right elects to crash the moon into the Earth.

"&gt;I control everything my body does. I control it as I type out this response. That's the reason you own yourself. If ""no one"" owns my body, then why do I have control over it?

erm...what? Ownership is not synonymous with Control. Analogy 101: A car thief breaks into your car and controls it via stealing it. You still have ownership of the car. Despite the thief taking control over it. It's A to B logic. You aren't controlling' your body to do anything, from any external POV. You *are* your body making those bodily movements which are a part of *you*. not distinct from the supposition of proprietary control. 

&gt;The only crime syndicates that would exist would be organizations that violate the NAP, i.e. bands of thieves. Everything else would be done through legal means. For example, no one would use a sex slave in some back-alley basement when they can go downtown and pay to use a refutable brothel.

As I've made beforehand, you're resting this erroneous presumption on the cradle of the NAP. Something that logically does not exist. nor does it exist in any legal text, of any sort. Violating the 'NAP' is still going to be profitable for those who can *take*. Might makes right is always profitable.

&gt;no one would use a sex slave in some back-alley basement when they can go downtown and pay to use a refutable brothel.

So human slaves are only limited to sexual favours? That's interesting.

"A lot of ancient dravidian tribes are now not pure dravidian.

Also just because they look a little more like average Indians, we shouldn't assume they were always rich/powerful (not claiming you did per se). Given how desperately poor a lot of Indians were, there was no reason to assume that people who looked more average Indian were any richer than people who looked dravidian. 

Lastly, many SCs are adi dravidar (though by now even they are mixed to a certain extent with regular dravidians). Which means tribes from before dravidian times. Some other tribes are just regular dravidian. Billavas might just be a regular dravidian tribe and not adi dravidar"

This week's episode touches on mental health issues and resources available for those suffering. That being said, the discussion is framed around advertising choices that YouTubers have been making of late. Videos of YouTubers claiming to be ""burntout"" and ""depressed"" are all over. Funny thing is, a new sponsor is making the rounds on some of the biggest channels on the platform. And yes, the sponsor claims to offer services for just what all the YouTubers are going through. Coincidence? Listen and decide.

"Probably a 529 plan.   If she uses it for college the earnings are tax free.  If she doesn't want to go to school, she can still use the money after paying taxes - just like a regular investment.  

I looked into setting up a 529 for my niece, and my financial advisor said Utah's 529 has the lowest fees.   The money can be used to go to school in any state when she goes to college.  However, you might get a tax break (on your state income taxes) if you use your own state's 529, so look into that.

Wherever you put money aside for her DO NOT PUT IT IN YOUR CHILD'S NAME.   I had a neighbor who did this.  Their daughter fell in with the wrong crowd and spent the entire amount on drugs.   They legally could not stop her from withdrawing money since she was 18 and the account was in her name.  She was a good girl from a good family who was just led astray, may she rest in peace.

"Real statistics answer: it’s pretty hard to quantify. The basic idea is that there is some unknown true distribution that generates the batting average he gets. The two primary factors that decide the probability are the mean of the distribution (on average, what does he hit) and the variance (how spread out is it).

We can estimate the mean as 0.247 * 566, his lifetime batting average times his average number of at bats. I’m only using the past three seasons, since before that there’s wild fluctuation in the number of at bats I’m too tired to properly compensate for right now. This gives us 139.8 hits per season, which is very close to the observed average hits for him (a good sign).

We can estimate the variance by np(1-p) where p is the batting average and n is the number of at bats. Assuming 566 at bats, this gives us a variance of 102.57. Now, we’re secretly more interested in the square root of that number, so let’s call it 10.1. This is the “standard deviation.” The thing we use the standard deviation for is to calculate how likely it is that we get a sampled result in the range mean - sd &lt; x &lt; mean + sd.

So, what happens when we plug in our numbers? Well, there’s a 65% chance that he hits between 129.7 and 149.9 hits per season. Using our mean number of at bats, that gives 0.230 and 0.265. So, right away we see the odds aren’t that great of hitting exact he same, if he only has a two-thirds chance to hit between those two numbers *once*.

There’s a 8% chance that he hits between 138.8 and 140.8, which is a BA between 0.245 and 0.249. Narrowing some more, there’s a 4% chance he hits between a 0.24611 and a 0.24788 in a single season. At this point pushing any deeper will lose meaning (and tbh it might have already) due to the fact you can only have integer number of hits.

These numbers look low, but they are actually surprisingly high. Let’s assume the last number is accurate, and there’s a 4% chance of him hitting this once. That means there’s a 0.04^3 = one in 15625. There are 1500 players on the active roster. I have no idea how many people play consecutive seasons, but let’s assume we have 1500 clones of Kris Davis, playing baseball forever. For a given string of 3 seasons, there’s a 90% chance that **none** of them do this. The switch-over point where hitting 0.247 three times in a row goes from less than half to make the half is between 6 and 7 seasons, so we should expect this approximately once a decade **if he is not an unusually consistent hitter**.

There’s a bunch of assumptions here (I picked the simplest model that can even do this calculation), but that should be in the right ballpark. The errors are likely to underestimate how rare this is, and some ballpark estimations suggests **somewhere between once every 15 and once every 30 years**, still assuming that his variance is typical of MLB players. If someone wants to go tell me the mean variance of an MLB hitter’s number of hits over the course of three years, I can get more accurate but I don’t know where I can easily get the data to calculate that. The other major thing that would increase my accuracy is knowing what percent of MLB players retire each season. I would estimate that it’s about 20% based off of a little Googling, which is part of my 15-30 years number.

This should be considered as “order of magnitude correct,” so it wouldn’t surprise me if the true answer was once every 200 to 300 years (ten times what I said) but it’s probably not one-in-one-thousand odds. If I had to place a bet, I would bet on one-in-thirty."

Unfortunately this isn't something you can ""compromise"" on. One of you is going to get the venue you prefer.


Think of the importance of other things that are different, other than just look. I don't think anyone is going to think that a hotel wedding is boring, especially with an outdoor Tuscany inspired ceremony. Also, no one is going to care about boring table cloths. Those shouldn't be deal breakers.


What is your budget and are there other things that either of you want that you wouldn't be able to get with the more expensive venue? Will getting your own booze/other things add extra stress when it comes to amount? Do you have to hire your own bartender? What about hiring a caterer and servers? Anythinf else that one includes that the others doesn't?

"Do you care about your girlfriend and want to stay together with her? If you’re too pissed off (which is totally understandable) just break it off, but the only way I see to change her mind is to behave in this way towards one of your female friends, which would probably creep her out to no end. Then either she’ll be incredibly hypocritical by getting mad at you but claiming it’s fine for her friend to behave in such a manner (so you know to give up), she’ll not care about you doing so (this probably would lead to a conversation regarding her opinions regarding monogamy, which would be helpful for whatever you ultimately decide), or she’ll recognize that if she doesn’t like it when you behave in this manner she shouldn’t act like it either, thus solving your problems."

Because the plat you end up on is related to both how much DXM you take *and* your body weight, there's a calculator here - [http://dxm.tripsit.me/](http://dxm.tripsit.me/) \- to help you figure that out.

That's really why stores don't pursue theft like they should. It's definitely not ""no big deal"" to most companies bottom line lol.

"I think that fishing is the more efficient method for finding enchanted books, but you may get some weird combinations. My base has a balcony that overlooks a river bend, and I’ve been doing a lot of fishing to round out levels if I get home and I’m close to the next one. I play on Pocket Edition, so an AFK setup isn’t possible. 

 Each time I’ve done this, I’ve pulled up at least one enchanted item, or an enchanted book. The items have been either bows or rods (both came up with either Unbreaking/Mending). They were in rough shape, but with mending already there, it was an easy fix with my anvil to combine them, and the enchantment will do the rest. 

As for the books, in a couple of in game day/night cycles, I have pulled up (if separated by a slash, the enchantments were on the same book)
Flame Aspect II,
Respiration III,  &amp;
Thorns II/Looting/ Flame (not sure if this is a glitch, but those don’t seem to go together)

I also have a Silk Touch I book that I bought from a librarian. The thing I like about fishing is that if you have a safe place to do it, it’s easy XP, and you can get some nice stuff. It took forever (and a bunch of trips back and forth to the village) to buy that one book, so hanging out on my deck with a cup of coffee once in a while doesn’t seem like such a bad deal.

Addiction ruined my father. I don't blame him, though. As I grew up I developed many of the same mental issues he had - panic attacks, social anxiety, crippling depression and anger issues - and I also ended up an addict for a decade, roughly.

I live with the knowledge that I can only trust myself within the bounds of my current mental state. When I'm depressed or anxious, I shut down and hide away. It's better than finding myself at the bottom of a bottle or a needle in hand, wishing for absolution that will never come.

I'm sober, but I don't congratulate myself - I'm lucky and I damn well know it. I just think about how much better this country would be (USA) if people got the treatment they needed, whenever they needed it.

I would have been so much better off.  Now I get to deal with the consequences of my actions. Poorer health, lesser economic and educational outcomes...

At the moment there are no rules for tracking seed to sale or testing. Last week the working group said they would send over to the DoH recommendations on contaminant/terpene/potency testing which would give them the authority to implement testing regulations. Echols said the testing implementation would go into effect six months later to give labs time to set up and growers to become compliant. I heard mention of a warning label going on to untested product in the meantime as a buyer beware kind of deal. The WG hasn't said anything about product tracking. And like I said in another thread with the lack of seed to sale tracking I fully expect shelves to have product available on the first day. Miracle bud that grows in half the time.

      There was a picture that came out with him and a few people, and for some reason the media  announced that this one blonde girl in the picture was the girl who shot him, and that they used to date. After a few days, the media finally came back and said that the girl in the picture had nothing to do with anything at all, she was just a friend and coworker of his, that she wasn't even the girl who killed him and that the girl who did kill him wasn't even his girlfriend either, just a neighbor. So the girlfriend part seemed to come from the fact that there were pictures of him with that random blonde girl who was wrongly identified as his murderer. 
      I feel really bad for that random girl though, that must've been awful for her to have her face plastered all over the news, being crucified by people because the media is telling them that she's a murderer who randomly killed her friend/coworker. I'm sure there's still people who didn't follow the story closely who saw the original story saying that she did it, and that's all they'll know about it now. Poor girl got labeled as a racist murderer just for being in a group photo with him.

"This is what I do. I load up on 25 cent and 1 dollar line ups. Do maybe 10 to 15 dollars worth each week, selecting from the pool of players I come up with during my weekly research. 

My research, I keep light, and limit to about 75 to 80% my normal weekly sports intake and just a little bit of sitting down and actually researching specifically for fantasy sports each week.

I usually have a range of results. A couple of dud line ups of course, but usually a few that cash at 50 cents to a dollar, and a couple they do decently well and make me 4 to 5 bucks (again, 25 cent and dollar games).

An average week has me coming out a few dollars or even 10 to 15 dollars ahead, and every once and a while I'll have a really strong week and win 40 or 50 bucks.

I basically find it fun to do, and this method allows me to always have money rolling over to make my line ups the next week. I've been doing it for 4 years on and off and won a couple grand at least and pulled most of it out.

I use DK and Fanduel and have only ever deposited 25 bucks of my own money into FD like 4 years ago. I won like 100 bucks early on, withdrew 75, put 25 into DK and 50 back into the bank. So in my life I've spent -25 bucks on DFS and won quite a bit.

And every week I have several shots and winning a decent chunk of change since I do the high volume GPPs. So even though the entry fee is low, you can win 5+ grand or even 15k or more depending on if it's a quarter or dollar game and the amount of entrants. "

"Personal favourite is Joe Smith for Pannone/Taylor.  We traded 18 innings of Joe Smith for a dude who by all counts will start in our rotation next year, and someone with 44 SBs this year.  That was a very good trade, that's probably as close to an A as you can get

Aledmys Diaz was a pleasant surprise, 108 OPS for JB Woodman, who got released by the Cards, that's rags for riches if I've ever seen it

A+ on the Loup deal because we got rid of Loup

Obvious one I'd want to redo is Donaldson, clearly a healthy JD is worth more and if I could go back in time I'd tell Shatkins to take Flaherty and run but hindsight is a bitch.

"I think the real issue is the trend twords extreme views. Nothing is inherently wrong with any one party affiliation, but when a person representsing that party, or the party in general, take on a more extreme stance, I can understand how someone might assume someone in that party, who more or less condones or supports those same extremist views, is not someone they find worth in. 
I think both parties in the us have gotten more and more extreme in their focus. And I think the way society is shaped is by the people in that society accepting or rejecting the actions/views of others. 
Democrats are the majority in the us by any statistic, and the vast majority of voters. Yet we have a GOP dominated political staff. So its seen as non-legitiment, and anyone who speaks twords its legitimacy is in the minority. The majority will always oppresse the minority. Not saying it's right, so much as it's normal. 

We have decided as a society that polygamy is wrong, and force those views on others that may or may it share. As far as I'm aware,as long as they are all consenting adults, there is no scientific or empirical evidence that it is somehow worse than monogamy. You could argue that that it's not ""right"" or ""wrong"", yet we as a society have deemed it illegal, because the vast majority of people out there prefer monogamy. The majority imposes its values on the minority and punishes those that defy it.

This exact thing in politics has always happened, it's just become more and more extreme as our political leaders take more and more extreme stances. Its entirely normal, and I would say expected, that two opposing parties would eventually one day stop seeing each other as competition, and start seeing each other as enemies. I think the dems and repubs are already there. I think it will only get worse, and will eventually lead to some sort of political war, which could very easily turn into real war, civil war. Might be long after anyone alive today is dead, but I think that's where we are headed."

I heard a rumour, well, it's not exactly a rumor, I heard from Aubrey that people are contracting Chinese chemical plants or whatever, labs? Anyway, he says there are a lot of cases popping up with people ordering these synthetic Ayahuasca batches and it just depends on the day of the week what kind of trace elements you'll get. That's a huge part of why Aubrey wants to get legit shaman together with locals in Peru to make legit Ayahuasca for this retreat weekend he's working on putting together. Yeah man, it's crazy because these places are just pumping out order after order of who knows what, and when you're a wild mother fucker your chances of running across something contaminated is just higher. But you just have to ask yourself what you're willing to accept from athletes who are just so focused on being the best """

"This is insane.  ""Because you already made up your mind, I should ignore any new evidence that may sway my opinion.""  Does the staffer who wrote this for him know how stupid it sounds?  Does he think because the ""other side"" already decided they don't like the nominee, that nothing else is relevant?  Does he think blinding himself to clear evidence that Kavanaugh has terrible judgement is somehow getting back at Bernie's blinding himself to any positive evidence?

Even if this letter points out a blemish of Bernie's and scores ""points,"" it doesn't make Grassley look good.  It shows he takes being petty over taking his job seriously.

How can Grassley have worked the same job for so long, and still look like a teenager on his first day whenever he actually does anything?"

Ruby Rose: The Speedy Hero, Red Reaper

- gets licensed to build Crescent Rose after the Noumus get really bad. 
- helps Deku get Full Cowl faster. 
- potential successor to OfA in a pinch? 
- Dekusquad member. 
- Deku x Ruby: Christmas Cookies 

Weiss Schnee: The Magical Hero, Snow Queen 
- Quirk: Glyphs
- Bonds with Todoroki and gets him over his issues a lot sooner. 
- top of academic scores. 
- The soundtrack for RWBY is what happened when she had a sleepover with Jirou. 
- Weiss x Todoroki: Defrost 

Blake Belladonna: The Shadowy Hero, Cheshire 
- Quirk: Shadow
- Stans Aizawa, and incorporates capture tape into Gambol Shroud’s Ribbons. 
- honorary Wild Wild Pussycat 
- relieved that she’s comparatively normal at UA
- all the recon missions
- the Fantasy AU is she and Ruby’s fanfiction and you can’t tell me otherwise lol. 
- Blake x Mirio: “Schrödinger’s Cat”

Yang Xiao Long: The Burning Hero, Sun Dragon
- Quirk: Blaze 
- **Takes over Bakusquad via Ritual Combat**
- Bakugou’s Character Development is so much faster now because Yang is emotionally intelligent. 
- Unstoppable puns w/Kaminari 
- wins Sports Festival 
- helps Deku learn H2H
- prank buddies/sparring partners with Mirio. 
- Yang x Kaminari: Stun Puns 

Honestly surprised there’s not more crossover fic with these shows!

We use an app called 23 snaps. You have to invite people to view photos of your child. We post his monthly photo on Facebook but that is about it.

"I think the thing missing was balance. Eminem's other albums were much more  well received as no matter which eminem you wanted to hear there would be content for you on the record. This is why revival seems to be liked or hated with not a whole lot of middle ground .

For example, I really like when em gets introspective as I feel it gives us rare glimpses as to what is really going on in the head of someone I've admired for well over a decade. So revial had quite a bit of content for me. For people who enjoyed the immature,  biting, crazy shit of slim shady, not so much. 

I won't deny that revival is in contention for the weakest eminem album but it is far from trash. There are many songs on it I enjoy to this day.  At the same time I dont have a hard time seeing why some people hated it."

"Little column A, little column B. I'm a big Tannehill fan so know my criticism of him is legit.

Tannehill was over throwing a lot of receivers early in the game. He targeted Amendola high on a couple throws but he couldn't bring them in. He wasn't as accurate and probably his worst game of the year, but his receivers couldn't break the man coverage and the non-existent run game couldn't set up the play action. Serveral times he was standing in the pocket for 4-5 seconds and couldn't find an open man.

Overall: bad game from Tannehill, equally bad from our WRs, worse game from our RBs"

I learned not to be intimidated by what the weed what showing me, and instead to use it as a tool to work towards a happier life.  

It’s clear how we choose to remain stuck in our old ways, even if they don’t serve us, just because we’ve grown comfortable with the situation. That attitude is detrimental to our happiness, and when we find the courage to make changes then everything starts to heal. "

"It was VMRO-DUI plan since the first week of the census.
From 2008 until 2016 the election processes in Macedonia were rigged.
VMRO and DUI didn't want the census to be completed because that would have brought into question all the election results from 2008 until 2011 because, according to the voter list around 90% of the population had a vote right (people over 18 year old), which doesn't make any sense (because around 17% of the population is under 14 year old). Both Vmro and Dui were using the old census for their election gain.
Reason to cancel the census was also the ethnic demography of Macedonia because some ethnic macedonians in Eastern Macedonia were getting Bulgarian citizenship and were declaring themselves as bulgarians and the torbesh population in Macedonia (which were counted as macedonians in the previous census) weren't declaring themselves as ethnic macedonians (Mavrovo-Rostuse, Debar, Kicevo, Debarca, Centar Zupa, Plasnica etc.) but, as turks.

"Jeez the feeling when you won't ever get another ""hi guys"" intro.

That being said, thank you for all that you've done and shared with us. I'm really surprised at how hard this is hitting me, like was I that invested? When did I even start, what year is it now? Really is strange being invested in someone I've never even met, but I suppose that's something life can hit you with, crazy. But yea, all those honest, genuine and unapologetic moments. The ramblings and musings. The music and coziness. Acknowledging the small happenings when you're recording. Quick cuts and captions. Definitely something different, like anybody can make noises and put it up as ASMR but a lot of it just feels hollow and soulless. (Not trying to slight other artists out there, they probably do put a lot into their productions, like why would't they. And then there's life timings and preferences in what you want to consume aghh.) You did it your way.

All of us could totally see how personal it was for you, along with all the time, care and effort you put in. I guess that's why reading this hits so hard for me. Feels like losing a close friend and the circumstances were just life and such. Second channel's awesome btw. This suckssssssss, it's like I'm cozy and now I have to get up and do something myself.

No. DPI and I&amp;sup2;S conflict with each other. The I&amp;sup2;S interface wants GPIOs 18+19+20+21 or 28+29+30+31. The first set conflicts with DPI and the second set only exists on the P5 header on a RPi 1 board. The I&amp;sup2;S interface doesn't support any other pin mapping.
"Ok maybe you should ask someone women who work in STEM if they feel like they’re receiving preferential treatment because they’re women. I mean I don’t work in stem so you may very well be right, but I’m just a little doubtful because my best friend who is a physics major is currently having a terrible experience with a job in a lab at our school where she’s the only woman, and more broadly, we live in a misogynistic society and so I’m kind of skeptical that women are really going to be receiving preferential treatment in any career field, especially one that’s historically been male dominated. But everyone’s experiences are different, so idk. If you think it’s a common occurrence you should definitely try to bring it up with your female coworkers one day and see if they feel the same. "
"Yup. Just leave them on a closet shelf in the dark and check on them once a week or so to see what you’re progress is looking like. Once the mycelium has completely overtaken the outside of the cake, let them sit for one more week to consolidate. Also, 75 degrees is perfect. 

Edit: Your setup might take a little longer than what you might be reading online. Full pint jars take considerably longer to colonize than half pints. In my experience, anyways. Good luck, bud✌🏽"

"It appears that you have taken notice to the Aristotle inspired Instagram: ""The soul never thinks without a picture."" 

The caption now host's context that derives from the study of 'Writing', established by Greek Philosopher Socrates written by his student and Greek Philosopher Plato's.

The groundwork for the Instagram is to encourage a philosophical perception, as the Images that are being viewed are imposed to fulfill multiple relative definitions to the provided caption. You will notice that some images do not host such relevance, however, will be intriguing in some form.

I do not portray myself to be Frank Sinatra, however, He is indeed one of the musicians, if not the only, that I listen to that contains words. I am more of a thinker and require a soothing sound relative to the Cello (Anastasia Kobekina) or Piano (Ludovico Einaudi).

That home is an exact copy of our home, except that it has been hideously updated, has a finished basement, a much nicer yard, and has carpet in some rooms (ours is all oak flooring minus the kitchen which is budget pergo). Our home has a 3 season room addition on the back which is only accessible from outside or walking through our bedroom, which includes the original sliding glass door (inside). The back room includes a wood burning fireplace, but is unusable for the duration of the winter months. Copy home has no appliances.

That doesn't make any sense and isn't based in ANY fact.
They are talking about the arc tether that sucks you towards it until you destroy it or it wears off.

I'm the same with a close straight friend who was my sophomore year roommate. We cuddled a lot and still do while watching TV.
"I'm a former member but I think my experience is applicable - find people you've enjoyed spending time with in some setting (work, sports, etc.) And then join them for whatever get together they might be enjoying.  Could there be drinking - yes.  Do you have to drink - no.  I enjoy drinking now but I have lots of friends who still go to church and don't drink - so when I hang out with them, I don't usually drink.  When I do - they don't care because I don't try to get them to drink with me.  

If they're really friend material, they won't try to peer pressure (they might offer) you into something you're not comfortable with."
"Are you joking? There are scrolls from scribes that you can use to give your party Battle Shout, Fort and Intellect. You have to turn in 3 of the Intellect ones for the Warfront quests currently up."
You will be happy once you do it. 20mg is just going to be like taking 5-10 tabs of acid although I have broken through on 30mg before so I guess it depends on the quality.
